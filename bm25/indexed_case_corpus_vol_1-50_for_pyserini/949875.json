{"id": "949875", "contents": "Pee Curiam.\nThe principle of this case was settled in Crozer v. Leland; and the very point was put for illustration. It is unnecessary, therefore, to do more than refer to that case. As to the proof received, it is enough to say, that it fell short. The witness did not pretend to identify the notice that was read in the defendant\u2019s presence; neither could he specify the day, nor say whether it was within the proper period. The plaintiff, therefore, signally failed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
