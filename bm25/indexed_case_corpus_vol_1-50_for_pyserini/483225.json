{"id": "483225", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\nWoodward, J.\nWhether the legacy to Lewis Dewart, Jr., in his grandfather\u2019s will, was vested or contingent, is not necessary to be decided, for the intention of the testator is unmistakably expressed that the payment of the legacy shall be postponed till a period subsequent to the legatee\u2019s attaining twenty-one years of age, and that meanwhile the testator\u2019s farms in Penn township shall stand charged \u201c with the payment of the same.\u201d\nThis is the only point necessary to be decided now. If the legatee should die before the time appointed for payment, the will provides that the legacy is to lapse into the residuary estate, all of which is given to the present appellant. As his interest in the farms has been sold at sheriff\u2019s sale, it may become, in the event of the legatee\u2019s dying before twenty-one years of age, a question of some nicety whether he shall then be permitted to take the legacy out of the land. But that question cannot arise at present. Though trustee of the legacy, the appellant is not entitled to receive it out of the moneys in court. It is rather his duty to maintain it as a fixed lien on the land. The purchasers had constructive notice of the charge, and they were bound to know that it was a lien of such indeterminate value that it would not be divested by the sheriff\u2019s sale. They will have to pay it, therefore, when it becomes due.\nAppeal dismissed at the costs of the appellant."}
