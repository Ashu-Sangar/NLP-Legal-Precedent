{"id": "979456", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nWoodward, J.\nIt seems to us that the Williams\u2019 title was unimpeached, and the court did well to rest their judgment on that. Williams bought at the request of Felt, who had acquired the suspicious title of Freeman before; but there is nothing in reason or law to prevent a man who holds a defective title from purchasing a better at a treasurer\u2019s sale for taxes. It is a very common remedy for defective titles. Williams then held a good title in trust for Felt, and he conveyed it to the defendants. Had there been anything to implicate Felt with the Freemans\u2014 if he had sustained the same relation to Coxe which they did \u2014 his measures to perfect his title might have enured to Coxe\u2019s benefit; but for aught that appears of record, he was under no obligations to Ooxe, and was as free to acquire title to the land as any other man.\nThe errors assigned have not been sustained, and the judgment is affirmed."}
