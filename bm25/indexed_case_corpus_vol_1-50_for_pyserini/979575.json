{"id": "979575", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered,\nby Lowrie, J.\nOur judgment just entered in the case of Lytle v. Colt\u2019s Executors, requires that this decree of distribution should be reversed, so far as relates to the claim'in that case. But we are not able to reform the decree so as to enter a final one, because we have not been furnished with the list of liens, and do not know how much remains yet due to the judgment of Hamilton and Wainwright. We must, therefore, reverse the decree and refer the case back to the Common Pleas for correction.\nDecree reversed accordingly, at the cost of Elihu Marvin."}
