{"id": "420587", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, November 12th 1863,\nRead, J.\nIn this case it was clearly the sheriff\u2019s duty to go to the place where the planing-machine was, an levy upon it. He did not do this in the case of these executions, and they were therefore postponed to the execution of Morris L. Hallowell & Co., under which the planing-machine was actually levied upon and sold. The court therefore were right in their charge to the jury. Mr. Fenlon was a competent witness, and the court made no error in rejecting the testimony of Mr. Linton,\ncontained in the auditor\u2019s report.\nJudgment affirmed."}
