And it is founded in justice and convenience; for a party, wbo does not enforce his right at the \u25a0 first moment, shows that he has not suffered by delay, and the signing of judgment is not imposed as a penalty. In this case the motion came too late.\nJudgment reversed and procedendo awarded."}
