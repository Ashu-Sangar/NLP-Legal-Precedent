{"id": "994036", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered,\nby Lowrie, C. J.\n\u2014 There is no error apparent on the face of this record. It is only by extraneous evidence that we discover that it was confessed by a married woman, and the same evidence shows that it was confessed by her to secure the payment of part of the purchase-money of a lot of ground then bought by and conveyed to her. The conveyance with the lien for the unpaid purchase-money, is all one transaction, and we must treat both the benefit and the burden as valid. The judgment-bond and the judgment entered on it are both invalid, as the personal obligation of a married woman: but they constituted a valid lien on the lot purchased, and the court was right in so restricting the effect of the execution. The case is ruled by our decision in Patterson v. Robinson, 1 Casey 81.\nProceedings affirmed."}
