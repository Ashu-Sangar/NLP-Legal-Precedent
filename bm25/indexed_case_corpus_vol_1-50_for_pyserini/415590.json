{"id": "415590", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nWoodward, J.\n\u2014 Welton & Reffert dissolved partnership by Welton selling- out to Reffert, and retiring from the business, on the latter agreeing to pay $150, \u201c and all the debts of the firm of Welton & Reffert, and keep said Welton free from any and all costs and damages in the settlement of'the same.\u201d\nOn the same day, Wolf agreed in writing with Welton that he would be \u201c security for the true and faithful performance of the above agreement on the part of T. W. Reffert.\u201d On this agreement the present suit is brought.\nIt is not denied that there has been a breach of Reffert\u2019s agreement, but it is said Wolfs undertaking was an entire contract, and two previous actions having been brought against him upon it, and recovery had for two firm debts, which Welton had to pay, it is denied that another action will lie.\nThe defendant\u2019s mistake consists in considering his contract an entire and not a severable one. Reffert\u2019s undertaking was to pay the debts of the firm. These were several \u2014 not connected or dependent. Wolf\u2019s contract was, that Reffert should pay these several debts. The parties could not possibly have contemplated one entire performance, but several distinct performances \u2014 as many, indeed, as there should be debts.\n\u201cWhen an agreement,\u201d said Judge Washington, in Perkins v. Hart, 11 Wheaton 251, \u201c embraces a number of distinct subjects, which admit of being separately executed and closed, it must be taken distributively, each subject being considered as forming the matter of a separate agreement after it is so closed.\u201d\nThis is the principle on which these contracts are not to be considered as indivisible and entire. When a debt is established against the firm, which Reffert refuses to pay, Wolf is bound to pay it, as if that was the very debt in respect of which he contracted. And it does not affect his liability that he has already paid two other debts, or that others remain behind, to be paid hereafter.\nSee the subject of entire and severable contracts, fully treated in the note of Hare & Wallace to the case of Cutter v. Powell, 2 Smith\u2019s L. C. p. 44, et seq.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
