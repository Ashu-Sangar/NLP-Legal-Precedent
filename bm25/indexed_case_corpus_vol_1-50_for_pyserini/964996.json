{"id": "964996", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nHibson, O. J.\nThe first question is whether the rights of the legatees were so far vested that the act of 1848 could not touch them. At the testator\u2019s death, his widow had her election to stick to her dower and abandon the will, or stick to the will and aban- . don her dower. Her inducements were her common law dower on the one hand, and her testamentary provision on the other. Pending her election, the legislature directed by that act, that the elev-. enth section of the act of 1883, which declared that every bequest to the testator\u2019s widow shall be taken to be in lieu of dower, unless it be otherwise expressed, \u201c shall not be construed to deprive the widow of the testator, in case she shall elect not to\u2019take under the last will and testament of her husband,.of her share of the personal estate of her husband under tlie intestate laws of .this commonwealth; but that the said widow may take her choice, either of the bequest or devise made to her under any last will or testament, or of her share of the personal estate under the intestate laws aforesaid.\u201d Accurately speaking, the widow of a tes-' tate husband has no share of the personal estate but what is given her by the will; still it is obvious the intention was to put it in her power, if she pleased, to have what she would have got had there not been a will. The rights of the parties, however, were ' fixed at the death, and the legislature could not unfix them. It is said they were not vested because the widow had not made her \u25a0choice; but they certainly would be impaired by swaying her choice by means of a premium for throwing the burthen of her provision on the legatees; and a law to give her such a premium, would be unconstitutional. She was entitled to choose between her testamentary provision and her dower, as it was at the death; and if her right of choice were enlarged it wouldbreak in on the, rights to be affected by it. It is not to be believed the testator would have made the same dispositions had he supposed the legislature had power to make it worth her while to disarrange them;; and in that aspect, his rights also, would be invaded.\nThe next point is more palpably unfounded. \u2019 The widow claims \u2019 a moiety of the profits of the real estate as dower. The' act of 1833, re-enacting a provision of the act of 1794, declares that' every devise or bequest to the testator\u2019s widow shall be in lieu of, her dower, unless the contrary be expressed: \u201cProvided that\u2019 nothing herein contained shall deprive the widow'of her choice. either of dower, or of the estate or property so devised or bequeathed.\u201d The act of 1833 had declared that when \u201can intestate shall leave a widow and collateral heirs, or other kindred, but no issue, the widow shall be entitled to one-half of the real estate, including the mansion house and ,the buildings appurtenant thereto, for the term of her lifeand this is claimed as a statute species of dower, though it derives no support from the act of 1848.\u2014 But there was no intestacy, and the intestate laws have never operated on land which has passed by will. In no part of them is the widow\u2019s share called dower. In this instance she took by the common law, and no more than it gave her. The matter has been viewed in this light by the profession; for no-lawyer ever thought of proceeding for dower in the orphan\u2019s court : \u2014 a conclusive proof that her estate under the\u2019 intestate laws is peculiar.\nThe remaining point has not a shadow of reason to support it.\nJudgment affirmed."}
