{"id": "988379", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nLowbxe, C. J.\nEven if this judgment were to stand, we do not see how the sheriff could execute an habere facias otherwise than by putting the plaintiff into possession in common with the defendants. But the parties have treated the case \u00e1s a claim to exclude one who is wrongfully in possession-as a tenant in common, and we shall take it so.\nIt is admitted, that Staver and Kissel were owners together of the land, and that Kissel conveyed his share to Ferguson and Betts. But Staver claims under a previous purchase from Kissel. Does he show a title that is valid under the statute of frauds? We think not.\nThere is a written settlement of partnership accounts between Staver and Kissel, and an agreement by Kissel to execute a deed; but a deed for what ? It does not even say for land ; and, if it means land, it does not profess to say for what land. The contract must be in writing. Its subject-matter is an essential part of it \u2014 and without it, there is no contract. If the subject-matter, the land, be described, we admit evidence in order to apply the descrip\u2019tion to the land; but we cannot admit parol evidence, first, to describe the land sold, and then, to apply the description. If authorities are wanted for this, they can be found in Soles v. Hickman, 20 State Rep. 182. The defendants\u2019 first, second, and fourth points ought to have been affirmed; and, perhaps, more might have been asked for.\nIt was error to admit Kissel\u2019s declarations made after he had parted with his title; but the other exceptions to evidence are not sustained.\nJudgment reversed, and a new trial awarded."}
