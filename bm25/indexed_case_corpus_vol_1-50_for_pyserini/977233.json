{"id": "977233", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nLewis, C. J.\nThe Act of Assembly directs the claimant of a mechanic\u2019s lien to file a statement of the demand in the office of the prothonotary, and expressly requires that such statement shall set forth \u201c the amount or sum claimed to be due, and the nature or kind of the work done, or the kind and amount of materials furnished.\u201d Barclay\u2019s Appeal, 1 Harris 496, decides that none of the previous decisions went so far as to dispense with \u201c the nature of the work or materials.\u201d\nIn the case before us, neither the claim failed, nor the evidence given on the trial, furnishes us with \u201c the nature or kind of work done,\u201d or \u201cthe kind and amount of materials furnished.\u201d' It is therefore defective.\nIn the claim filed, the sum of $440 is claimed as a balance of \u201c the contract price for the erection and construction of the building, and the materials furnished for the same.\u201d This was inserted in manuscript in a printed blank, and might be sufficient to control the subsequent repugnant allegation in printed letters, that the work and materials were done and furnished \u201c for and about the erection and construction of the building and appurtenances.\u201d But the omission to state either the value of the work done, or the kind of materials furnished, renders the claim incurably vicious.\nThere is nothing in the case to cure this defect. The claimant must bring himself within the terms of the act under which he claims a lien. He has failed to do that, and the judgment must be affirmed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
