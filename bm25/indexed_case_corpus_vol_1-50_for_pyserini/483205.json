{"id": "483205", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\nLowrie, C. J.\nAny one who will examine the case of Butler v. Urch, 2 Grant\u2019s Cases 247, will easily see that its decision enforced the true duties existing between the parties; but we are not now satisfied that the reasons which we their assigned are the proper ones. The 14th section of the Hundred Dollar Act gives justices of the peace jurisdiction of claims over a hundred dollars, \u201c if the parties voluntarily appear before him for that purpose ;\u201d and we think now that this means appearing without any writ served, and that it has been so generally understood, as the cases cited in the argument show. We think now that voluntary appearance, not in answer to any process served, is a condition of the justice\u2019s jurisdiction in such cases. And in the present case the judgment of the justice and its \u00abaffirmance below ought to be considered as expressing the true merits of the case, for it was confessed and signed by the defendant, and there is no pretence that it is not truly entered, or that there was any unfairness in the hearing. Yet possibly the Common Pleas might have reversed it, had it not been for the case of Butler v. Urch. They affirmed the judgment; can we review their decision ? We at first thought yes, because of the want of jurisdiction appearing on the record. But we find, \u00a7 22, that one of the very purposes of the certiorari is to inquire whether the cause of action was \u201c cognisable before a justice of the peace,\u201d and the next words make the judgment of the Common Pleas final, and exclude a writ of error. This is too peremptory to be overlooked.\nWrit of error quashed."}
