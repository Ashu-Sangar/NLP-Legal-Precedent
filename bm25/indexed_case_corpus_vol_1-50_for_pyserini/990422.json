{"id": "990422", "contents": "Per Curiam.\nThe general plank-road law gives a special legal remedy for throwing open the turnpikes or toll-gates of roads that are not kept in order; and therefore this bill in equity for an injunction to effectuate the same object, cannot be allowed. And the action being improper, we cannot volunteer to decide any of the legal questions raised in it.\nDecree affirmed."}
