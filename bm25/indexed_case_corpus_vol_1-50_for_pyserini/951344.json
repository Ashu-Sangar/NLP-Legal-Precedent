O\u2019Neal v. O\u2019Neal, 4 Watts & Serg. 130. It seems, also, that he may take advantage of this objection, on the trial of the issue on the scire facias; for in Pancake v. Harris, 10 Serg. & Rawle, 109, it was decided that the declaration, being in substance a declaration in assumpsit for goods sold and delivered, and the judgment not for a liquidated sum, the plaintiff could recover nothing from the garnishee, without executing a writ of inquiry; and he was allowed to take advantage of the objection on the plea of nulla bona; and the judgment for the garnishee in the court below was affirmed in error. We consider, however, the objection rather in the nature of a plea in abatement, on account of the irregularity in issuing the scire facias, and not as a plea in bar that concludes the plaintiff when his proceedings are made regular.\nJudgment affirmed, and record remitted."}
