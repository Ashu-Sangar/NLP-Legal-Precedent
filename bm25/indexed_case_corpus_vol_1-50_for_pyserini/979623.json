{"id": "979623", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nKnox, J.\nWe perceive no error in this case except in the instructions given by the Common Pleas to the jury upon the measure of damages. The jury were permitted to find for the plaintiff the full amount which the defendant had stipulated that O\u2019Neil would subscribe to the capital stock of the company in the event of the selection of the western route.\nThe true measure of damages, was the difference between the value of the stock at the time of the trial, and the amount which the defendant had agreed that O\u2019Neil should pay for it. This will make good to the plaintiff the actual loss sustained by the nonperformance of the defendant, and will at the same time relieve the defendant from the necessity of himself becoming \u00e1 stockholder in a company in which he had never subscribed, or agreed to subscribe to the capital stock. To allow the full subscription price as the measure of damages, is to allow the company to get the money and keep the stock, or in effect to change the terms of the contract by compelling the defendant to do himself what he had stipulated that another should do. The case was not one for specific performance: 1st, Because O\u2019Neil could not be compelled to take the stock; and 2d, Because a recovery of the difference between the par and the market value would be an adequate remedy for the injury sustained.\nJudgment reversed and venire de novo awarded."}
