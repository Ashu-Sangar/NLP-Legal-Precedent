Such price may be used as evidence, whether paid in money or by exchange of other property. In an action on the case for deceit, this perhaps would be the lowest measure of damages; \u201c for where the wrong complained of is characterized by fraud, malice, or gross carelessness, I think the rule of damages should be extended, so as to embrace all damages which naturally flow therefrompe:\" Hubbard, J., Sharon v. Masher, 17 Barb. 620.\nIn the present case, the declaration was in assumpsit, the plea not guilty, and it was tried as an action on the case for deceit. The charge, therefore, of the judge, as. to the measure of damages, was as favourable to the defendants as they had any right to ask. This disposes of all the errors assigned; there being none assigned as to the rejection of the evidence contained in the last bill of exceptions.\nJudgment affirmed."}
