{"id": "992196", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nLowrie, C. J.\nIn this case a feigned issue was directed to try by jury a question of law, to wit, \u201c the right of the widow to her election, &c., as provided for by Act of Assembly.\u201d We should not like to have it supposed that such issues are often tried by jury. \u2022 Generally, feigned issues are framed to try definite and clearly defined questions of fact, and they ought always to be so. If the parties cannot, and do not, clearly define the fact in dispute, there ought to be no issue ordered.\nNo issue was needed here. The land was levied on in the defendant\u2019s lifetime, and regularly sold after his death; the price paid, and the deed acknowledged and delivered. His widow, after that, could-not elect to take her $300, or any of it, out of that land. Against such injustice, even to favour a widow, no argument ought to be expected.\nThe decree awarding part of the appellant\u2019s land to the widow is reversed, and it is ordered that she pay the costs of the proceeding; and the cause is remitted to the Orphans\u2019 Court, that this decree as to costs may be there enforced."}
