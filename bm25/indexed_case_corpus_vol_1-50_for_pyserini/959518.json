{"id": "959518", "contents": "Burnside, J.\nThe hills of exception to evidence are not sustained. No rule of the law of evidence was violated. It would be a waste of time to discuss the bills in detail.\nNor are we able to discover that the error assigned to the charge is in a better situation. We think the court adopted the correct rule in estimating any damage Irvin sustained. It was certainly proper for the jury to regard the whole purchase.\nJudgment affirmed."}
