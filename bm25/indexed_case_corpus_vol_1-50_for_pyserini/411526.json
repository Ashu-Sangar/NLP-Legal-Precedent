{"id": "411526", "contents": "The opinion of the Court was delivered by\nBlack, C. J.\n\u2014 This is trespass for building a balcony which over-bung the plaintiff\u2019s land. It was found, upon evidence quite sufficient, that the soil belonged to the plaintiff, though it was subject !to a right of Way, and was used as a private alley. The only point of the case which is strong enough to bear an argument is, that the statute of limitations had extinguished the plaintiff\u2019s title. There was a privy on the ground in dispute, but it is not proved to have been there for twenty-on'e.years. To eke out the case, it was shown that after the privy was removed, the spot it had occupied was used for a dungheap. This will not do. The mere throwing of manure on another's land is not-such an adverse possession as will give any \u25a0right under the statute to him who does it; -much less will it enable a third person to 'say, that the original owner\u2019s title is gone, \u25a0and appropriate it to himself for that reason.\n\u25a0If we thought the errors assigned to the admission of evidence were important, we would probably examine them -although they are not specified according to the rule. In dismissing them for want of formal correctness, we bring the case-to thesame conclusion it would reach if we decided -them on their merits.\nJudgment affirmed.\nLewis, J., dissented."}
