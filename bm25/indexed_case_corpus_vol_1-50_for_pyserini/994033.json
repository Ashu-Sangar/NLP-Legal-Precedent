Smith. We have affirmed that appeal, and this leaves Mary C. Smith, widow of Harvey J. Smith, deceased, entitled to administration: and the decree of the Register\u2019s Court, affirming the revocation of letters of administration cum test, annexo to the appellant by the register, and granting letters to the said Mary 0. Smithj is entitled to be affirmed; no other ground being alleged against her claim to administration, excepting that predicated of the proceedings in divorce. That being set aside, she is therefore entitled, and the decree affirming the action of the register is\nAffirmed."}
