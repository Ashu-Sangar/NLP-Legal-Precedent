{"id": "990461", "contents": "Per Curiam.\nThe purpose of an attachment execution is to reach the effects of a defendant in the hands of third persons. Here, the defendant is a corporation; a railroad company. Are its ticket agents to be treated as third persons, so far as regards money received by them on the sal\u00e9 of tickets to passengers ? We think not. We suppose that the ease speaks of the ordinary ticket agents employed at the offices of the company; and of these we speak. These are the very hands of the company; it cannot do its business without them; and if an attachment execution is to be regarded.\u00e1s arresting money received after its service, then it would always occasion the dismissal of such agents, in order to prevent such a result.\nWe do not undertake to define the class of agents that fall within the principle here decided. We shall be able to do this better, by awaiting the instructions of experience.-\nJudgment affirmed and record remitted."}
