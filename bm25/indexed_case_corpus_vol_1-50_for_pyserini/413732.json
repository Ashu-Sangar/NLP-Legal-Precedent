Any assignment not in accordance with this rule, will be held the same as \"none.\u201d\nThe specification of error in this ease, relates to the admission of Thomas Norris as a witness; but neither \u201c the bill of exception\u201d nor \u201cthe full substance of it,\u201d is stated \u201cin immediate connection with the specification.\u201d Indeed, neither of these important particulars is to be found in any part of the paper-book. The error assigned is therefore not sustained. It must, in accordance with the rule, be \u201cheld the same as none.\u201d\nJudgment affirmed."}
