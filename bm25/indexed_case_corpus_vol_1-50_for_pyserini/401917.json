Diamond Alley, in the city'of Pittsburgh. \" \u2022\n- On the trial below, it was admitted the legal title of the premises' in question was in Doctor Herron, the defendant in error ;\u25a0 -\u00e1nd'that he'held the property in trust, for Eve H\u00e1mshire and .her issue,-who intermarried with- George Anshutz, jun; On the 7th January, 183.3,\" Anshutz leased the property to Robert'McCullough for the term of six years, from the 1st of April following; at a rent qfi four hundred dollars per annum. McCullough proceeded.to build, a tan-.house on-the premises, and on- the 7th August, 1833, James Aberp'rombie filed a mechanic\u2019s lien 'against Robert McCullough.for $618.67, for materials furnished and labour done on a brick.tan-house.

Robert McCullough to James Abercrombie,, the. plaintiff in the. .execution, for four hundred dollars. 2.1st March, - 1\u2019834, sheriff\u2019s deed poll to James Abercrombie.' \u2022\nThere, was evidence that Anshutz assent\u00e9d to the erection of the. building, and that Doctor Herron- permitted -him to take care of'the property. No doubt this was so ;; but .there is no' evidence in the case that Dr. Herron had notice of the mechanics lien filed, against McCullough, or of the purchase by Abercrombie. '.\n\u2022 In this proceeding, what did Abercrombie purchase ? He brought no party on the record but McCullough. His scire facias was against him, and hi's fi.fa., levy and sale was of:all the right, title, interest, and claim of McCullough. That title, interest, and claim was a six years\u2019 lease. The counsel for the plaintiff in error contends that the opinion of this court, as delivered by Mr. Justice Kennedy, in the case of Ho'Idship against Abercrombie, 9 Watts, 52, being a former ejectment for the same premises, determines this case in favour of the. defendant in this ejectment. I have looked carefully into the record in that case. I find that that ejectment was brought in the Common Pleas on the 25th March, 1837; tried on the 1st June,\u2019 1838. The lease to McCullough did not end until the 1st April, 1839. In that case, the title was in the plaintiff. It was impossible to resist a recovery, if the point had been made. The title of McCullough by the sheriff\u2019s sale was v\u00e9sted in Abercrombie, and that title was then in full force. . An ejectment in Pennsylvania is a possessory action, and Abercrombie was entitled to the possession beyond all question, until'the 1st of April, 1839. Nor was the\u2019point in that case made, that although the proceeding was thought to be in rertv, the holder of the legal title was not brought on the record, and that, after the lien filed, the whole proceeding against McCullough was as' in the ordinary case of debt. Such a proceeding cannot divest him in remainder. It had no operation on the title of Doctor Herron. Although inadequacy of price is no ground to set .aside a sheriff\u2019s sale, yet it is manifest from the price, that every person knew and supposed that only the title of McCullough was selling, when a productive property in the heart of the city of Pittsburgh only brought what was equal to one year\u2019s rent, and that, before the brick tan-house was erected. It is said, many sales will be affected unless the court hold that the fee passed in this case. I doubt this. But, if it were true, that is no reason why a wrong construction should be given to'our mechanics\u2019 lien law. If such construction has been given in a case that did not require it, it is our duty to correct it. What is this case ? A lien filed against a mere tenant who is putting up a building for his own convenience; no other person brought upon the record no notice by scire facias, or otherwise, to the owner of'.the premises.; a levy and sale of all the right, title, and interest of that tenant. Nothing passed by the sheriff\u2019s sale but the title levied. Nothing more was sold and conveyed by the sheriff. This has been determined in many cases. I need only refer to Carpenter v. Cameron, 7 Watts, 51, and McCormick v. Harvey, 9 Watts, 482. The judgment is affirmed."}
