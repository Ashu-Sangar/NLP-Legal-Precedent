{"id": "960658", "contents": "Per Curiam.\nThis cause is ruled by The Bank of Pittsburgh v. Whitehead. The rule laid down there, is, that notice to a corporator is not notice to the corporation, unless he were constituted an organ of communication between it and those who deal with it. The corporator, in this case, was not such an organ, and the evidence was properly rejected.\nJudgment affirmed."}
