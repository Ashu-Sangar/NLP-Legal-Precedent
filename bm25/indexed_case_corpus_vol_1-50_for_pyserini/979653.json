{"id": "979653", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nKnox, J.\nThe addition of the name of John Young, agent, as plaintiff, and the filing a new count averring the covenant to have been entered into between John Young, agent of Elizabeth Bright,-and Daniel Druckenmiller, were proper amendments to be allowed by the Court of Common Pleas.\nIn cases originating before justices of the peace, great liberality has always been exercised in adding names to the record to obviate technical objections to the form in which the suit was brought; and now we have express legislative authority \u201cto add or change names, whether of plaintiff or defendant, in any stage of the proceeding, whenever it shall appear that a mistake or omission has been made in the name or names'of any such party.\u201d John Young\u2019s name was omitted by mistake, and whether the mistake was of law or of fact, the court had power to correct-it. \u2022 The amendment to the declaration introduced no new cause of action, but merely made the pleadings conform to. the state of the record after the addition of the agent\u2019s name as a party.\nThe defendant was not injured by the rejection of the depositions of Lydia and Mary Druckenmiller; for the declarations of Mrs. Bright, as stated in the depositions, formed no part of the contract, and could not in any wise aid the defence.\nJudgment affirmed."}
