{"id": "982851", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nLewis, 0. J.\nThe question raised in this case is, whether a minister of the gospel, employed,and paid by an unincorporated religious society, is liable to taxation for his \u201coccupation\u201d or \u201cprofession.\u201d The 32d section of the Act of 29th April, 1844, declares that \u201c all offices, posts of profit, professions, trades, and occupations, except the occupation of farmers,\u201d \u201cshall be valued and assessed, and subject to taxation.\u201d The term \u201cprofession\u201d designates the calling of a minister of the gospel with sufficient precision. That term is especially applicable to persons w'ho teach or practise in law, physic, or divinity. It is universally understood that ministers of the gospel are members of a learned profession. If this were not so, there is no difficulty whatever in classifying their calling under the head of \u201c occupations.\u201d The clause, describing these objects of taxation, is sufficiently general in its language to embrace clergymen, who live by their professions, or derive a profit from them. The exception in favour of \u201c farmers,\u201d excludes all other exceptions. If the legislature had intended to except the occupation of a clergyman from taxation, they would have said so when they were making an exception in favour of the occupation of farmers. This construction is also enforced by the principle which controls in regard to the imposition of public burthens. All men who receive the advantages of government are bound to contribute to its support, and therefore the rule is established that \u201c none can claim exemption unless the exemption be so clearly expressed in the statute as to admit of no other construction:\u201d 10 Harris 496.\nThe arguments urged against this assessment are, that a minister of the gospel exercises an \u201c office,\u201d and not a \u201cprofession\u201d\u2014 that the emoluments of his office are \u201cgifts of the altar\u201d\u2014 \u201c spiritualities,\u201d too sacred to be taxed by the government \u2014 that his office is held \u201c by divine appointment of God himself, and he therefore owes no tribute or allegiance to the state;\u201d and that a law imposing a tax on his occupation would tend to a union of church and state, and would be unconstitutional. It was decided in Commonwealth v. Cuyler, 5 W. & S. 375, that a minister of an incorporated religious society, is not an officer whose salary is liable to taxation. Conceding that he may be, in some senses, an officer, it is plain that - he is not an officer within the meaning of the law regulating taxation. If he were, his case would be worse instead of better, for the salaries of officers are taxed two per cent, on all sums over $200, while \u201c occupations\u201d and \u201cprofessions\u201d are taxed only one per cent, on their value. It is not our province to decide whether persons learned in theology may regard the emoluments of a minister\u2019s calling as \u201cgifts of the altar \u2014 as spiritualities.\u201d The question here is, how are they to be regarded in a court of law, when the government demands of them a contribution to pay the debt and expenses of the state. The money paid to a minister for his services, and designed for his personal benefit, is very far from being a mere \u201c spirituality.\u201d It is designed to supply his temporal wants. It is appropriated to that object alone. His services to the congregation may indeed be spiritual; but he would not be able to live long if his compensation were of the same character. Fortunately for him it is not so; but is paid in a currency as tangible and purely temporal as the wants it provides for. He may hold his \u201c appointment of God.\u201d \u201c All power is of God.\u201d \u201c The powers that be are ordained of God,\u201d and he has \u201c no right to resist their ordinances,\u201d or to refuse \u201c tribute,\u201d, or to renounce \u201c allegiance to the state.\u201d It is his duty as a Christian \u201c to be subject not only for wrath, but for conscience\u2019 sake,\u201d and to pay \u201ctribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom.\u201d The Saviour came into the world, at the very period when his earthly parents, at great inconvenience to themselves, were setting an example of allegiance to the government, and of obedience to its revenue laws. His precepts afterwards were always in accordance with that example. And the law, resting upon the foundation of that Christian morality which requires all who receive protection from government to contribute a just share to its support, will enforce its claims.\nThere is a difference between the minister\u2019s occupation and the church building. The building neither yields, nor was designed to yield, any pecuniary profit for individual benefit. The occupation of the minister yields a profit for his own private use. This may be the reason why the legislature have taxed the latter and not the former. We do not see how a law which makes no distinction between ecclesiastical occupations and other pursuits, but taxes all alike, can tend to a union of church and state. To hold that a minister of the gospel cannot be taxed at all, lest religious rivalry might lead to the abuse of that power, would furnish a precedent for denying all power of taxation; for there is no power which might not be abused by bad men. We must trust to the intelligence of the people to guard against this evil. So far from seeing any constitutional objection to the imposition of taxes upon clergymen, as well as upon other professions, it has been seriously questioned whether they can constitutionally be exempted from their share of the public taxes. The constitution declares that \u201c no\u2019 man can of right be compelled to support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry against his consent.\u201d A numerous class of our citizens still hold to the faith of the founders of this Commonwealth, and bear their testimony against what they call a \u201chireling ministry.\u201d Many others read their Bibles in their own way, disclaiming all connexion with religious congregations. If these classes of citizens should be compelled to pay more than their just proportion of taxes, in order that ministers of the gospel might be exempt, it is substantially the same thing as collecting the excess of taxes and paying it to the ministers to aid in maintaining them. Such a partial rule of .taxation compels the Protestant to aid in maintaining the ministry of the Roman Catholic, constrains both to aid in supporting the Jewish priesthood; forces each to support a form of religion which his conscience rejects, and compels the opponents of all to aid in supporting all. These suggestions may serve to show that the claim to constitutional exemption is not only rejected, but met by a counter claim, which may deserve consideration when the question arises. At present it is sufficient to say that the Act of Assembly does not exempt the \u201cprofession\u201d of a clergyman from taxation.\nThe Commonwealth v. Cuyler, 5 W. & S. 275, does not touch the present question. The question there was under the Act of 30th April, 1841. Here it is under the Act of 29th April, 1844. There the question was, whether a minister of an incorporated religious society was an \u201c officer.\u201d Here it is, whether such employment by an unincorporated, religious society is an \u201c occupation or profession.\u201d There it was whether his salary could be taxed two per cent. Here it is whether the value of his calling shall be taxed one per cent. The questions are essentially different, and that case does not rule this. The argument of the judge who ruled the case of Commonwealth v. Cuyler, is not to be extended beyond the case before him. The views expressed by Judge Lowrie in Union County v. James, 9 Harris 525, are more in accordance with sound policy and the true construction of the statute.\nJudgment reversed, and judgment for the plaintiff in error on the verdict.\nWoodward, J., dissented."}
