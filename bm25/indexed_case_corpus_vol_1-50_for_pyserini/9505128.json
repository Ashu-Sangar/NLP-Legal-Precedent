{"id": "9505128", "contents": "The opinion of the Court was delivered, October 1, 1855, by\nWoodwaed, J.\nWe see no substance in the errors assigned by the assignee. The charge of interest was according to the usual rule. If the assignee did not use the funds, he might have done so, and it was his duty to make them productive.\nThe expenses referred to in the second error must be considered as compensated in the general allowance made by the auditors.\nWe are not sure that we could get nearer to the exact measure of justice due to the parties, and therefore we affirm all that the auditors have done.\nJudgment affirmed."}
