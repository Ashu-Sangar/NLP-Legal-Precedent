{"id": "975886", "contents": "The opinion of the Court was delivered by\nEowrie, J. \u2014\nThis plaintiff claims this land under a grant from his mother, and he' fails because she had no equity. One who desires to enforce specific performance of \u00e1 parol contract for the purchase of land must present his claim without any unnecessary delay, and while affairs remain in such a condition that performance can be enforced without injury to others, and especially he must not himself have done any act that is incompatible with his claim for performance, or that makes such a claim inequitable.\nHere eleven years elapsed between the bre'aeh of the alleged contract by the plaintiff\u2019s grandfather, when he claimed and got back the land from the plaintiff\u2019s mother, and the bringing of this suit. In the meantime the grandfather made considerable improvements on the land, and then died, having made his will devising away to his children this and his other land: the devisee of this portion is in possession of it as part of her share 'of her father\u2019s estate, and must lose it if this claim succeeds; and the plaintiff\u2019s mother was bequeathed $100, and it was paid to her.\nThese circumstances very obviously set aside the equity on which the plaintiff relies, if it ever existed, which is very doubtful; Besides this, ejectment is not the proper form of remedy for enforcing specific performance of such, a contract against the estate of a decedent: 17 State Rep. 193; 19 Id. 491.\nJudgment affirmed."}
