{"id": "415560", "contents": "Per Curiam.\n\u2014 There is no difficulty in Creswell\u2019s title. It was devised to him for life, with remainder to his issue, and this plainly gives him an estate tail. He has barred the entail according to law, and thus converted his estate into a fee simple, and the purchaser of it shows no valid objection to the complete execution of his contract. The authorities on this subject are so well presented by the defendant in error, that we are saved from repeating them.\nJudgment affirmed."}
