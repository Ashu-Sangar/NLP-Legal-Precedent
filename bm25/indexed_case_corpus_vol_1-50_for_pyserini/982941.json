{"id": "982941", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nLowrie, J.\nIt seems to us that the simplest, and the true mode of treating this matter, is to regard McFarland & Co. as bona fide mortgagees of Mrs. Rupp\u2019s title, without notice of the secret title now alleged to be in Mr. Rupp; for so their claim appears in the auditor\u2019s report, which is not excepted to on this account. The result, then, is very plain, that their lien is not cut off by the subsequent discovery of this secret title. Their equity is superior to the title of Wightman.\nDecree affirmed at the appellant\u2019s cost."}
