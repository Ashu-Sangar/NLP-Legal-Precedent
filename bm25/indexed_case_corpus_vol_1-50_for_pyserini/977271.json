{"id": "977271", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nLewis, C. J.\nThis is an attempt to make one man answer for the debt of another. In such a case the law is well settled, that the evidence of the promise must be \u201c clear and explicit, that there should be no room to suspect mistake, misapprehension, or any unfairness in the transaction:\u201d Petriken v. Baldy, 7 W. & Ser. 430. \u201c It is the duty of the individual who contracts with one man on the credit of another, not to trust to ambiguous phrases and strained constructions, but to require an explicit and plain declaration of the obligations he is about to assume:\u201d Russell v. Clark\u2019s Executor, 7 Cranch 69. It is also well established that \u201ca guarantor of future credit is entitled to notice from the party giving the credit, of his acceptance of the guaranty, unless the agreement to accept be contemporaneous with it:\u201d Kay v. Allen, 9 Barr 320. In this case the evidence relied on comes from the plaintiff\u2019s agent. It is not likely to lose anything material to the plaintiff as it passes through such a channel. The witness, told Unangst that he \u201c was selling for Hibler, and would not like to sell (to George Wenner) unless he made a Iona fide one \u2014 to be safe, you know.\u201d Unangst observed, \u201cif George Wenner is not good enough, I am.\u201d The witness then replied, \u201c Yes, for $10,000, if you requested it.\u201d But Unangst, although thus invited to make the request, did not do so. He said nothing more on the subject. He merely \u201csmiled,\u201d and afterwards asked the witness to take a drink. In this there is no \u201cclear and explicit\u201d contract to be liable for the goods to be furnished to Wenner \u2014 no \u201c explicit and plain declaration of the obligation.\u201d There was no agreement between the parties at all. There was no acceptance of any offer of guaranty \u2014 no amount fixed by the parties, nor was there any subsequent notice of the amount furnished on the credit of the alleged guaranty. There was no evidence to justify the court in submitting to the jury the question of guaranty. Taking all that the witness stated to be true, it amounted to nothing like a contract between the parties. The court ought to have instructed the jury that the plaintiff, under the evidence, was not entitled to recover.\nJudgment reversed and venire facias de novo awarded."}
