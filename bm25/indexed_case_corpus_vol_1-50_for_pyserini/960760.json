{"id": "960760", "contents": "Burnside, J.\nFrom proceedings under the compulsory arbitration act, there is no remedy by writ of error. The act of Assembly gives a remedy by appeal, and appeal only. Such has been the uniform course of decision in this court. The cases on this subject are collected and reviewed by Mr. Justice Huston in Le Barren v. Harriott et al. 3 Penn. Rep. 154. In Brinter v. Ridenhour, not reported, it was held, after award for the plaintiff,- and no cause of action stated in the declaration, this court would not interfere. We can do nothing for the plaintiff in error. .\nJudgment affirmed."}
