{"id": "977210", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nWoodward, J.\nWhat is decisive against the plaintiff\u2019s bill is, that he has not made the Schuylkill Navigation Company a party, by whom the injury was committed of which he complains.\nBy what authority they dug the basin and destroyed Bethel\u2019s road \u2014 whether in virtue of the powers vested in them by their charter, or by contract and agreement of the riparian owners\u2014 cannot be known until they are heard; but from Bethel\u2019s acquiescence in what they did, and the use by him and others under him of the tow-path bridge to reach the landing, it is fair to infer, in the absence of complaint against the company, that they had due authority for their acts and doings. The plaintiff\u2019s landing and right of way might be taken for public use like any other private property. If taken at all, the whole case shows it was done by that corporation. This, then, is an attempt to make an individual in no wise connected with the company restore that which they have taken without question of their right. No argument can support such a claim, and none is needed to answer it. The statement of the claim is the best possible refutation of it.\nThe only injury which the plaintiff appears to have sustained at the hands of the defendant, was the mud that was thrown upon his land in clearing out the basin, and for this he has ample remedy at law.\nThere is no ground whatever disclosed for the extraordinary remedy by injunction, and the decree of the court in dismissing the plaintiff\u2019s bill is affirmed."}
