{"id": "964982", "contents": "Per curiam.\nAn attachment under the act of 1836, is process to enforce the judgment; and it is, in substance, if not in form, an execution. It differs from a fieri facias essentially only in this, that it reaches effects, from which the debt could otherwise not be levied. It is usually called an attachment execution; but whatever the name, it is within the spirit and purview of the statute.\nJudgment affirmed."}
