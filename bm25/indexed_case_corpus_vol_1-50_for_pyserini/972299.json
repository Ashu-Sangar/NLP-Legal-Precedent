{"id": "972299", "contents": "Per Curiam.\nWhere a tenant of land receives the cattle of third persons to be pastured at hire, are they subject to a distress for rent ? Certainly not; else the law of distress would be a mere trap to catch other people\u2019s property. Where, in the course of the tenant\u2019s business, he receives the property of third persons as a means of making a livelihood, it .is not subject to distress.\nJudgment affirmed."}
