{"id": "972330", "contents": "The opinion of the Court was delivered, by\nWoodward, J.\nThe lien filed in this ease, beside describing the building with more particularity than is demanded by the Act of Assembly, contains a copy of the plaintiff\u2019s account for materials, showing that they were charged to the contractor \u201cfor John Brown\u2019s house.\u201d\nThe plaintiff offered evidence in support of his lien, and it ought to have been received. Even if the materials had been charged to the contractor individually, it would have been competent to show that they were furnished on the credit of that particular building: Presbyterian Church v. Allison, 10 Barr 413. Obviously, then, an account, which, on its face, recognised the building to be charged, was competent.\nIt is not necessary that the account should contain the very words of the statute, \u201cfor or about the ereetion or construction of the building.\u201d Any equivalent words are sufficient. \u201cBor John Brown\u2019s house\u201d is as good a designation as the more tautological phrase of the Legislature.\nThe judgment is reversed and a venire de novo awarded."}
