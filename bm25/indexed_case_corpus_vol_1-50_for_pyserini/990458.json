{"id": "990458", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nThompson, J.\nThe sale of the land out of which this controversy has arisen, by Irvine, the trustee, with the assent of Leiper, the cestui que trust, undoubtedly brought the land within the rule in equity which requires it to be treated as personal estate for the purpose of regulating the succession to it. That it was such a conversion, so far as the widow and heirs were concerned, is clearly ruled in Rangler\u2019s Appeal, 3 Barr 377; Foster v. Harris, 10 Id. 457; Rose v. Jessup, 7 Harris 281; Longwell v. Bentley, 11 Id. 99; Leiper\u2019s Executors v. Irvine, 2 Casey 54.\nAfter the death of the decedent, the purchase-money fell due, and, had it been collected, no one will doubt, but that the widow would have been entitled to her third of it, she having elected to take under the intestate laws, and not under the will of her husband. It was not collected, however, but, by arrangement between the trustee and vendees, with the assent of Mrs. Leiper, the time for. payment was extended, with a stipulation that, if not paid at the expiration thereof, the contract was to be forfeited, and the land to revert to the owners. There was a failure of payment, and the consequence was a rescission of the contract. Was this a reconversion, so as to change the rights of the widow and heirs? The auditor and court below thought not, and in this they are fully sustained by the cases cited. In Rose v. Jessup, the very point arose and was ruled, Lowrie, J., saying that, the testator having \u201c sold real estate by valid agreements, the sums due thereon were part of his personal estate, and on his death his widow\u2019s interest therein became immediately vested.\u201d \u201cIt was the duty of the trustees to proceed on the agreement and collect the money for those having a right to claim it. If such pursuit should result in recovering bach the land, they were bound to account for that, as a substitute for the money, and subject to the same trusts.\u201d In substance, the same thing was said in Leiper\u2019s Executors v. Irvine, 2 Casey 54.\nThere is no room for the distinction, I apprehend, between a recovery back of the land in pursuit of the money, and taking it back as the result of the forfeiture of the contract for non-payment of the purchase-money at the time fixed. Strictly speaking, this provision was a remedy to enforce payment of the purchase-money, and was, in substance, an agreement to yield up the land in satisfaction of the contract, in lieu of the money, if that was not forthcoming. In the case last cited, Lewis, C. J., said, \u201cif they\u201d (the widow and heirs), \u201chad aright to the proceeds\u201d of the contract for the sale of the lands, which he had immediately before asserted, \u201c they had, of course, a right to take the land in lieu of the money with the assent of the vendees.\u201d This is so directly in point, that we need not farther discuss this branch of the ease.\nNor is there anything whatever in the ease, as has been suggested, which raises any implication, other than that the land was taken in lieu of the purchase-money. This being so, the right of the widow in it is just what it would have been if money and not land had been received. On the resale she was therefore entitled to the one-third of the purchase-money, and consequently to the one-third of the proceeds of the certificates of stock of the \u201cMcKean Land and Improvement Company.\u201d These views 'cover all the assignments of error, and in none of them do we find anything to correct.\nDecree of the Orphans\u2019 Court affirmed."}
