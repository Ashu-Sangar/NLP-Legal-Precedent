{"id": "413751", "contents": "The opinion of the Court was delivered by\nLewis, J.\nThe regularity of a judgment cannot be inquired into in a collateral action. The judgment is conclusive upon all matters which have been pleaded or given in evidence in bar of the action. If confessed by an attorney, it is also conclusive of the attorney\u2019s authority. Where an attorney appears without authority and confesses judgment, the remedy is against him; or in-a proper case, an application may be made to open the judgment. Where an attorney confesses judgment against several partners, under an authority derived from only one, it is the duty of the others to make immediate application to the Court to open the judgment. If they omit this, after notice, and permit their lands to he levied on, condemned, and sold, they are concluded by their own acquiescence, if not otherwise precluded, from raising the objection against the sheriff\u2019s vendee. Giving notice of the objection, at the sheriff\u2019s sale, amounts to-nothing more than to show-that the party complaining has notice himself of the defect of authority, but acquiesces in it by taking no measures to arrest the proceedings. The Court below was clearly right in rejecting the evidence offered to impeach the plaintiff\u2019s title under the sheriff\u2019s sale.\nJudgment affirmed."}
