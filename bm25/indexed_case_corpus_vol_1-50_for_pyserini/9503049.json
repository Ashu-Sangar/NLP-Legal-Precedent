{"id": "9503049", "contents": "The opinion of the Court was delivered by\nKnox, J.\nThis was an action of trespass on the case by Sarah M. Robb against William McCormick, for breach of marriage promise. The plaintiff recovered $1500 damages.\nThe first bill of exceptions was to the admission of testimony that the plaintiff had invited the witness to her wedding with the defendant, which was to take place at the plaintiff\u2019s house, on the 22d day of September, 1853. This evidence was offered to prove mutuality of promise and readiness on the part of the plaintiff to comply with the contract. It was objected to, on the ground that there was no proof of a promise on behalf of the defendant antecedent to the date of the alleged invitation. This objection was not well taken. There was evidence of the defendant\u2019s admission that he had promised to marry the plaintiff, and although the time of the contract was not mentioned, the jury might well infer that it was previous to tbe 22d of September, 1853. Tbe objection to tbe reception of the evidence was special; but had it been general it would not have availed tbe defendant, as tbe evidence was competent for tbe purpose for which it was offered.\nTbe declarations of the son as to tbe reasons why his mother broke up housekeeping, were clearly incompetent. They were offered, as it is said, in the bill of exceptions, \u201c for the purpose of showing by members of the family the general design of the family in breaking up housekeeping.\u201d The general design of the family had nothing to do with the question, and if it had, such general design could not be shown by hearsay.\nIt is unnecessary to examine the errors assigned upon the charge in detail. It was for the jury to determine \u201c whether the plaintiff was willing and ready, and offered to marry the defendant, or not;\u201d and so the Court told them. After the defendant declared the contract at an end, the plaintiff was not required to make a formal offer to perform on her part before bringing suit.\nWe see no reason for interfering with this judgment.\nJudgment affirmed."}
