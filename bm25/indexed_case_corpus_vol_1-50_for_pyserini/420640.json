{"id": "420640", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, November 5th 1863, by\nWoodward, J.\nIn Stuckey v. Keefe\u2019s Executors, 2 Casey 399, it is ruled upon numerous authorities that a conveyance of land to husband and wife creates neither a tenancy in common nor a joint tenancy, and that upon the death of either the survivor takes no new estate, but the whole estate continues in the survivor the same as it would continue in a corporation after the death of one of the corporators.\nThe land in controversy here was conveyed to Seely and wife, with express reference to the above rule. The .language of the habendum is, \u201c to be held by the said parties of the second part, in unity, under the decision of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, in the case of Stuckey v. Keefe\u2019s Executors, vol. 26 Penna. Rep. 397.\u201d A deed thus made and accepted will admit of but one construction. It must have the effect the parties intended.\nIf the Married Woman\u2019s Act be supposed capable of controlling the wife\u2019s interest, the answer is, that the estate did not \u201c accrue\u201d to the wife within the meaning of the act, and she had no such interest during life as could descend to heirs, living her husband. It was a contingent remainder that was destroyed when she died before her husband.\nIt is not necessary to consider what would have been the effect of showing that the purchase-money came from the wdfe, or that the estate was a paternal advancement to her, for the case is not so presented as to raise either of these questions.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
