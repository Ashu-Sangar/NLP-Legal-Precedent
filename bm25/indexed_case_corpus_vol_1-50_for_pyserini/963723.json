{"id": "963723", "contents": "Per Curiam.\nThe justice\u2019s docket contains no entry of an offer to confess judgment for a particular sum. The fact that such an offer was made appears in his certificate to authenticate the transcript sent up with the appeal; but it is no part of the transcript; and no better than the unofficial assertion of the justice, which would not be received even under the sanction of his oath.\nJudgment affirmed."}
