{"id": "401934", "contents": "Per Curiam.\nIt is not easy to perceive any contradiction in the charge, or error of any sort. It is true that the alteration of a specialty by parol makes the whole a new contract by parol; but it is also true, that a part of a specialty omitted by mistake may be supplied by parol evidence, and that the plaintiff may recover on the entire contract, as a specialty, just as if nothing had been omitted. Such was the direction, and we see nothing wrong in it.\nJudgment affirmed."}
