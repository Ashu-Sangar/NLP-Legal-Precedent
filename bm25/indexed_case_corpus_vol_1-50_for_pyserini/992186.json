{"id": "992186", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nStrong, J.\n'That under the will of Andrew Burgett, an estate tail was given t\u00f3 his son Boston, admits of no doubt. The rule in Shelly\u2019s case is an established rule of property in Pennsylvania. At this late day, it would be useless to attempt to vindicate it, or reply to the.oft-repeated objection that it defeats the particular intent of the donor or testator. It is sufficient for us, that the rule is too deeply seated to be overthrown by judicial decision. The devise in this will is directly within the rule. The testator gives his real estate to his son \u201c during his natural life, and at his decease to descend to his legitimate offspring for ever.\u201d He then directs that \u201c in case the said Boston\u2019s issue becomes extinct, the land shall go over to devisees named in the will.\u201d The words \u201c legitimate offspring\u201d and \u201cissue\u201d are used interchangeably as having the same meaning, and if he had not defined the term \u201c offspring,\u201d the law has, in repeated instances. It is regarded as nomen eolleetivum.\nOffspring then is a word of limitation, not of purchase. Those embraced in its meaning take by descent through Boston Burgett, not as primary objects of the testator\u2019s bounty. Of course the estate of the first taker was an estate tail, and it having been barred under the Act of Assembly, the plaintiff below had a title in fee simple.\nThe judgment of the Court of Common Pleas is therefore affirmed."}
