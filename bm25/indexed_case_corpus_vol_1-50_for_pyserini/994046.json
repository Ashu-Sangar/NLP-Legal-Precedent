{"id": "994046", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\nStrong, J.\n\u2014 What has been said in Woodward\u2019s Appeal disposes of this case, if it be properly here. But the appellant has no interest in the controversy. He is a mere stakeholder, and to him it is a matter of indifference whether the money in his hands goes in discharge of the mortgage, or directly to the administrator of Mrs. Davis. The appeal is therefore dismissed with costs."}
