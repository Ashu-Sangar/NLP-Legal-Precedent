{"id": "963803", "contents": "Per Curiam.\nAs the Act of Assembly is silent as to the person who is to be the obligee, the bond was well taken in the name of the judge; but the condition of it exacts more than the law allows. By the Act he is required to give bond to appear; by the bond taken he is not only to appear, but to appear, answer, and abide the decision. In case of a second adjournment, there ought to be a. second bond. The one taken, therefore, is void.\nJudgment affirmed."}
