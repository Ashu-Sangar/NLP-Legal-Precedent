{"id": "963730", "contents": "Per Curiam.\nA defendant has no right by the Act of 1806 to amend his plea, after judgment on demurrer. It was his folly not to withdraw it when the first demurrer to it was withdrawn. Nor could he have the benefit of an amendment at the trial, by filing a new plea. He would trifle with his statutory privilege, were he allowed to do so.\nJudgment affirmed."}
