{"id": "959569", "contents": "Per Curiam.\nThe principle adopted in the case of the Allentown Road, 5Whart. 445, is applicable to this. The court refused to quash the proceedings for a similar misprision of the clerk in the order, which might have been set right below. That, it is true, was a road case; but the present is analogous to it, and entirely within the reason of it. Had the deficiency in the order been pointed out, the court would have supplied it, and referred the report back to the viewers for their sanction of it; and thus the objection would have been obviated without prejudice to any one. It consequently ought not to prevail here.\nProceedings affirmed."}
