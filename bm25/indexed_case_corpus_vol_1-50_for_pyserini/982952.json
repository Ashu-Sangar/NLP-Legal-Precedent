{"id": "982952", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nKnox, J.\nWe agree with the Common Pleas that there was no evidence that the plaintiff below had either actual or constructive notice of the conveyance from David Mead to the Commonwealth.\nIt is true the deed was recorded in the office of the secretary of the Commonwealth, but there is nothing in the recording acts which gives to such a record validity against a subsequent bona fide purchaser for a valuable consideration. The occupancy of the arsenal lot was not notice of the grant of the 100 foot street, and there does not appear to have been such an open or continued use of the ground in controversy, by the public as a street, as to put a purchaser upon inquiry as to the existence of the grant.\nWe are by no means certain that actual notice would have affected the plaintiff\u2019s title, based as it was, upon a mortgage anterior to the conveyance from Mead to the Commonwealth; but as the want of notice is itself conclusive against the plaintiff in error, it is unnecessary to determine the effect of notice, had it existed.\nJudgment affirmed."}
