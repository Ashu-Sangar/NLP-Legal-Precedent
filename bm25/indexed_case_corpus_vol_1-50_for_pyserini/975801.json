{"id": "975801", "contents": "The opinion of the Court was delivered by\nWoodward, J.\nThe will under which the plaintiff claims contains all the unimportant phrases of the form book, without a single intelligible devise or bequest. Such a will is insensible and void. It is incapable of being interpreted or executed. The parol evidence that was offered, and properly rejected, might have made a will for the testator, but could have given no vitality to this senseless and shapeless instrument.\nThe judgment is affirmed."}
