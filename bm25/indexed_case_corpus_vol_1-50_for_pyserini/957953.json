{"id": "957953", "contents": "Per Curiam.\nIt is settled by Knisley v. Shenberger, 7 Watts, 194, that a writ of error does not lie to the opinion of the Common Pleas on a question of error alleged to have been committed by arbitrators. The present is, in effect, a writ of error to the arbitrators; for the errors assigned are theirs, and not the errors of the court. But we can reverse only for error in the judgment \u2014 not in the award.\nJudgment affirmed."}
