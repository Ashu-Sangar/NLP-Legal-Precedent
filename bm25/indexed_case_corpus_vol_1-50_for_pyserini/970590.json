{"id": "970590", "contents": "The opinion of the Court was delivered by\nBlack, C. J.\nAll the exceptions here may be summed up in this: that the damages were not justified by the evidence. But we can take no notice of evidence given to the viewers. It is not and cannot be made a part of the record. It would be better not to put such evidence on the paper-books. When it is placed before us we will treat it, as we treat all other extraneous matter, and give it no attention.\nJudgment affirmed."}
