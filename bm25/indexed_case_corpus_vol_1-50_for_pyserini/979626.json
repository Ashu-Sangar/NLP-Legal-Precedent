{"id": "979626", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nLewis, C. J.\nA stay of execution is a privilege in derogation, of the common law rights of the plaintiff, and the party claiming the privilege must bring himself strictly within the statute granting it. The statute requires, as a condition, that bail shall be entered within thirty days \u201cfrom the rendition of the judgment.\u201d In this case the judgmentwas entered on the 23d February, 1856, and the bail was not entered until the 26th of March, 1866. This was too late, and the court below fell into an error in setting aside the execution.\nThe order setting aside the execution is reversed, and the record remitted for further proceedings according to law."}
