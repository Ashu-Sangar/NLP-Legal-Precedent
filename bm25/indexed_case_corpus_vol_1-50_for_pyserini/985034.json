{"id": "985034", "contents": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nLowrie, J.\nTo sustain this defence would be to allow a contract to be changed by one of the parties to it. If the house was finished, and the defendant could not get the $175, there would be some equity in his defence. He is indeed paying for what he has not received; but it would be very inconvenient to allow this as a set-off in such an action, for it would throw open a perpetual rent to a perpetual dispute, by an unwritten alteration of its amount, and thus make set-offs to be the cause of- strifes, instead of a way of ending them, and this must be watched against.\nAnd it makes no difference that Mangle\u2019s title was sold on Stiles\u2019s judgment. The law, and not the plaintiff, fixes the effect of a judgment, and makes it a lien only on the defendant\u2019s title; and a sale under it can reach no further, except against \u00bfsecret equities. Stiles had a right to enforce his judgment against this Jot, and the purchaser under it assumes Mangle\u2019s unfulfilled covenants, both as to the rent, and as to the means of securing it by the erection of the house.\nJudgment affirmed."}
