The judgment on a scire facias, like the one it is employed to revive, is quod recuperet; and the same presumption of payment from time follows the one as the other. Why, then, should the legislature be thought to have made a difference ? The word revived is inadvertently used for the word alive; and hence the difficulty and the argument. But the case is too clearly within the intent of the act to admit of a doubt; and the execution, therefore, oughtnot to have been set aside.\nOrder of the court below reversed."}
