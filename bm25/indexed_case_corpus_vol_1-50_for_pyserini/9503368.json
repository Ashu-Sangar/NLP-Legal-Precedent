{"id": "9503368", "contents": "Per Curiam.\nThis was meant to be a proceeding before an alderman, under the Act of 14th April, 1851, which forbids the sale of liquors on Sunday, and prescribes a penalty of fifty dollars against any one who shall be \u201c duly convicted thereof.\u201d\nIt is an action of debt and a judgment \u2014 not a criminal proceeding and a conviction. It is brought against the offender in the name of an individual who professes to sue for the Commonwealth as well as for himself. The statute authorizes no such suit, and this record is wrong altogether.\nBut the writ of certiorari is not more regular than the justice\u2019s record. It is issued against the Commonwealth, who is no party to the proceeding. The justice was not bound to send up this record, for the writ did not command him to do so, and it is not before us in any legal sense. A certiorari against the Commonwealth does not give us jurisdiction to reverse a judgment of Henry Kirk against Valentine Speeht. We can do nothing but quash the writ.\nWrit quashed.\nSee postea, p. 131, case of Van Swartow v. Commonwealth."}
