The deed purported to be for the consideration of love and affection, in part, and for the additional consideration of $400. By an agreement, executed at the time of the conveyance, it appeared that the daughters, in part consideration of the deed, were bound to maintain their father for the term of his life. To support the money consideration mentioned in the deed, the plaintiffs in- error offered to prove that the grantees, after they became of age, and before, “ for several years previous to the execution of the conveyance, worked for their father, by grubbing, clearing, making fence, mowing, chopping, and doing all kinds of work on the farm, and about the house.” There was no offer to prove that this work had been done under an express contract that the father would pay wages for their services, or that any other relations existed between the parties than the usual relations of parent and child.</p>

There was, therefore, no error in rejecting the evidence stated in the first and second bills of exception. This disposes of the first assignment of error; and the others do not specify the errors complained of with sufficient precision to receive consideration.

It is true that a voluntary conveyance by a father to a child is not void by the statute of 13 Eliz., merely because the father was indebted at the time. If the grantor possessed other property sufficient at the time to pay all his debts, and he was not about to contract other debts, such a conveyance may be good: <a href="/citations/?q=5%20W.%20404" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 W. 404">5 <em>W. </em>404</a>; <a href="/whart/4/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="4 Whart. 27" data-case-ids="1834974" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0027-01">4 <em>Wh. </em>27</a>; 6 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>101.
