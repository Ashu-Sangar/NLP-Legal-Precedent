A parol contract was attempted to be proved by the declarations of the former owner that be had made a contract with the claimant for the sale of the land, the same being accompanied by proof of possession taken under the contract and valuable improvements made: but, on the other side, declarations of the claimant were given in evidence to the effect that he had but <em>the use of the land: </em>Held, that such evidence left the claim too uncertain to entitle the party to specific execution. In order to recover, under a claim by parol, <em>a contract </em>between the parties must be proved.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b474-6" data-blocks='[["BL_474.6",474,[354,505,1158,847]]]'>The defendants resisted the recovery, claiming under an alleged parol contract for the sale of the land by William Rankin to Andrew Simpson, one of the defendants, alleging that possession had been taken under said contract, the terms thereof complied with, and valuable improvements made by said Simpson. The evidence in support of this alleged contract consisted of various declarations of the said William Rankin, commencing as early as October, 1826, before Simpson moved to the farm, to the effect that he, Rankin, had made an arrangement with Andrew Simpson to move to the farm and take charge of Margaret Rankin, an idiot sister of said Rankin, and use and keep the farm as his own; and if said Margaret lived any length of time, Simpson was to have the farm for her keeping; if she did not, he, Rankin, was to give Simpson the farm on such terms that he could pay the balance. Also, subsequent declarations of Rankin, made at various times until near his death, tending to show that Rankin had given this place to Simpson for keeping said sister; and that he would make the title to him were it not for Simpson’s indebtedness. Simpson moved to the farm in October, 1826, and continued thereon till the trial of this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b474-7" data-blocks='[["BL_474.7",474,[350,1362,1157,942]]]'>The plaintiffs, to rebut this, gave in evidence the declarations of <em>Simpson, </em>made at different times during the life of Rankin and after his death, that the land belonged to Rankin and to his estate, that he, Simpson, only had the <em>use of it </em>for the keeping of the idiot sister. The plaintiffs also gave in evidence two written agreements, signed by the parties, one dated 1st September, 1834, by which the said Simpson agreed to farm the said place “ on which he now lives” for the said Rankin, for the term of six yéars then ensuing; keep the said Margaret in boarding, &amp;e., during said term; take care of all horses and cattle put under his charge by Rankin; keep the place in good repair, and thresh and deliver all grain he might raise to said Rankin, for the yearly consideration of $200, to be paid to him by said Rankin. The other agreement was dated the 20th day of July, 1841, of the same tenor as the former, for the term of six years from the 1st day of April then last past, for the yearly consideration of $175. The plaintiffs also gave in evidence nine several receipts signed by said Simpson to said Rankin, the first dated 1st September, 1835, and the last dated 4th April, 1843, for the yearly considerations mentioned in said agreements, each receipt expressing it to be in full for attending to, or services rendered on, his (Rankin’s) farm for the last year.</p>

Has he shown the fact of agreement ? A mere intention in the mind of Rankin, to convey him the land in fee at some time, is not sufficient. Has he shown the subject-matter and the terms distinctly, and that possession was given and taken under the contract, and in pursuance of its provisions ? If he has failed in any of these essential points, he has failed to take his ease out of the statute. In arriving at their conclusion, the jury will consider, not merely the testimony adduced on one side, but all the evidence in the cause — the acts and declarations of the parties, giving due weight to the agreements and receipts in evidence, as tending to prove or disprove the existence of such a contract as defendant relies on.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b475-6" data-blocks='[["BL_475.6",475,[168,939,1167,774]]]'>“ Defendant contends further, that if he has failed in clearly showing a valid contract for the fee simple in the land, he has established a contract that he should have the land for Margaret’s life, on condition of his keeping and maintaining her. It must be admitted, that, in this view of the case, the declarations of both Rankin and Simpson stand better together, and can be more easily reconciled. The jury must observe the rule laid down as to parol contracts, and if they shall be satisfied that such a contract as this Was made, and that Simpson went on the land in pursuance of it, and has performed his part of the contract, the plaintiffs cannot recover in this action, the defendant, in that ease, being entitled to keep possession of the land <em>during Margaret’s life, </em>if he shall continue to perform the condition upon which he alleges he holds it. The defendant’s counsel ask us, verbally, to instruct the jury that if he has established a valid contract, no subsequent declarations of his could divest his title. This is true, but the jury are left to consider these declarations as tending to prove or disprove the existence of the alleged contract.”</p>

He observed, that if parties, between whom a contract exists, make a subsequent one on the same subject-matter, inconsistent with the first one, the former agreement is abrogated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b475-8" data-blocks='[["BL_475.8",475,[169,2012,1165,423]]]'>He further observed, that the allegation that such written agreements were made to protect Simpson’s property from his creditors, and were not intended to affect the previous contract between the parties, did not improve the condition of Simpson, because, if they did determine the alleged previous contract, though they might be invalid against Simpson’s creditors, they would be good as between the parties, and would revest the title in Rankin. Rut as the point was presented too late, he declined instructing the jury upon it, and submitted the case to the jury on the questions previously indicated.</p>

The plaintiffs, having the legal title to the land, instituted this action of ejectment to recover the possession. The defendants resisted the plaintiffs’ right to recover on the ground that William Rankin, the father of the plaintiffs, in his lifetime, made a parol sale of the land to Andrew Simpson, in consideration of his moving on the farm and taking care of Margaret Rankin, an insane sister of William Rankin, and that he had fully performed the contract on his part. The defendants are to be regarded as standing in a Court of Chancery, asking for a decree of specific execution of the alleged contract. They ask, in effect, that the legal title of the plaintiffs shall be conveyed to them.</p>

A contract is the agreement of two or more minds, on a sufficient consideration, to do or not to do a certain thing, and when it is to be proved by the declarations of the parties, and these declarations stand opposed as the poles of a needle, how can a <em>contract be </em>said to <em>be </em>proved ? <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>Where was the concurrence, the agreement of the two minds ?

Thenceforth the possession was referable to that agreement, and Simpson was estopped from alleging a precedent and inconsistent parol agreement.

Possession, considered as evidence of a parol contract and as part performance to take it out of the statute, must not only be delivered and taken, but must be maintained in pursuance of the parol contract. Hence, if a purchaser by parol take possession under his contract, and afterward attorn to the vendor as landlord, or fix upon himself any other character than that with which he entered, he lets go his equities, and his possession is referred to his new agreement. And where the agreement, as in this case, is reduced to writing in terms perfectly inconsistent with the idea of a parol sale, it becomes the most faithful memorial which ingenuity can devise or the law adopt.</p>

To execute a parol contract against an express statute is the exercise of a large power; but to execute it without competent proof of its existence, without the established test of its part execution, and against the declarations of the party asking for it as well as against the highest written evidence in his power to create, would be a wild stretch of authority, which no Court„of law or equity ought to make.</p>

If he have made an instrument to defraud his neighbor, he cannot call on the Court to protect him when it is used against himself.</p>
