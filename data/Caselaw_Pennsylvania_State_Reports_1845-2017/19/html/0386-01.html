The suit was brought before a justice of the peace, and came into Court by appeal. The plaintiff claimed that the animal was exempt from execution, by virtue of the eighth section of the Act of 22d April, 1846, exempting from levy and sale, by virtue of any execution or distress for rent, one horse, mare, &amp;g., when owned by any person actually engaged in the science of agriculture. The plaintiff alleged that he was a farmer, and was entitled by law to the exemption.

It is not among the articles declared exempt from execution by the Act of 1836; but it was added by the Act of 1846. Then the Act of 1849 provides an entirely different system of exemption, repeals the old laws entirely, and declares that its own provisions shall not take effect until the 4th day of July, 1849, and shall apply only to debts contracted on and after that date.</p>

Wo think it does not. It is true, that the repealing clause is peremptory enough, if we look at it alone. But the last section qualifies its apparent absoluteness, and declares that the whole act shall apply only to debts subsequently contracted. The plain meaning of this is, not only that for future transactions there shall be a new law, but that the repealing clause is intended to affect only such cases. When it declares that it shall not operate on old debts, it excludes its repealing clause from operating upon them. While, <a id="p388" href="#p388" data-label="388" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*388</a>therefore, the Court below was right in rejecting the Act of 1851, it was wrong in the construction put upon the Act of 1849. It is impossible to suppose that the Legislature was intending to exclude all exemptions on debts contracted prior <em>to </em>4th July, 1849, and yet this is the construction of the repealing clause contended for by the defendant in error.</p>
