The law protects its own officer in the discharge of the duties imposed upon him. It has been found that in the discharge of those duties he has properly advanced his own money.

Of course it cannot allow that money to go out of its power, until the expenses incurred under its sanction, in the care and custody of the thing converted, have been repaid, at least as far as the money will go. The sequestrator has therefore the preference.</p>
