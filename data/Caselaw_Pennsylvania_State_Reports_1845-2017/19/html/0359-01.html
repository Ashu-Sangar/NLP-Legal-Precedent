      <em>v. </em>Slack, 7 <em>Barr </em>254. The Court were right in sustaining the action brought, but they were in error in declining to refer to the jury the question of the defendant’s knowledge of the evil propensities of his dog. And their answewthat this was an action at common law was a wholly insufficient reason for withholding that question from the jury; for, whether the action be at common law or under the statute, the scienter is alike indispensable. The gist of the action is not the negligent keeping of the dog, but the keeping him with knowledge of his vicious disposition. Dogs belong to the class of domestic animals which are not ordinarily dangerous, and which it is lawful to keep, except in places where they are forbidden by some legislative or municipal provision. But when they become mischievous, and knowledge of this is brought home to the owner, good neighborhood, as well as the law, forbids a longer existence, and the owner should terminate it, If he do not, he is liable in damages for the misdemeanors of his dog. If the action be for the “full compensation” mentioned in the statute, it may be, as we have said, in trespass; if it be at common law, it is generally held that it must be <em>in case; </em>but either way the scienter must be proved. See the authorities collected in 1 <em>Saunders’ Pleadings and Evidence </em>755.</p>
