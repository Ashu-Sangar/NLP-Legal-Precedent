      <em>Jacob </em>Eckhart died in July, 1841, and letters of administration on his estate issued to Sarah Eckhart and Jacob Martin. The latter settled an account and was discharged. Sarah Eckhart, as administratrix, under an order of Orphans’ Court, made sale of certain real estate of the intestate to Michael Meiser, in January, 1847, and for a part of the purchase-money took his judgment notes. On one of them judgment was entered to February Term, 1847, for $500, payable 1st April, 1851, with interest. The note was payable to Sarah Eckhart, administratrix, &amp;c.: an account by <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>her was settled in the Orphans’ Court, in which she was charged with the amount of the note or judgment in question in this case. Before the said note became due, Sarah Eckhart died, being insolvent ; and on 10th April, 1850, letters of administration on her estate were granted to William Cox. An inventory of her estate was filed, in which this note was included. After the said judgment became due, and before letters of administration <em>de bonis non </em>on the estate of Jacob Eckhart were granted to Michael Eckhart, the latter notified Meiser, the defendant in the judgment, not to pay the said judgment to Cox. He, however, paid it to Cox, and received the note on which the judgment was entered. Subsequently, viz. 12th May, 1851, <em>Michael </em>Eckhart received letters of administration <em>de bonis non </em>on the estate of the said Jacob Eckhart, and had an execution issued on the said judgment against Michael Meiser. The latter, on 15th September, 1851, had a rule granted to show cause why the execution should not be set aside, which rule, on 22d December, 1851, was discharged by the Court. To this the writ of error was taken, and the discharge of the rule was assigned for error.</p>

Meiser knew the origin of the debt, that it was assets belonging to the estate of Jacob Eckhart, deceased, and that it did not belong to the estate of Sarah Eckhart. In addition to this, he received' notice from Michael Eckhart, who was one of the distributees (upon the death of Sarah Eckhart), cautioning him not to pay the money to her administrator. If the money had been paid to her in her lifetime, equity would follow it as long as it could be identified, until arrested by the equity' of a purchaser without notice. But the money never came into her hands; it remained in the hands of Meiser until after her death, so that there is no difficulty in identifying it as the property of the creditors -and distributees of Jacob Eckhart, deceased. The payment after the death of Sarah Eckhart to her administrator, with full notice of the facts, was a misapplication of the money to one who had no right to receive it. The <em>right </em>in <em>equity </em>is clearly with the defendant in error, independent of the Act of 1834; but the provisions of that act supply the <em>remedy </em>at law. Under the authority of that act the defendant in error, as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Jacob Eckhart, deceased, had a right to sue forth a writ of execution on the judgment obtained by “ his predecessor in the administration.” <em>The </em>Court below committed no error in refusing to set it aside.</p>
