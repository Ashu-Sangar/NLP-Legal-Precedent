According to the statute and the rule entered under it, <em>the submission </em>was of “ all matters in variance between the parties in this cause.” This submission was limited by the rules of pleading and of evidence. By the agreement it was enlarged to embrace “all matters in variance between the parties of every nature and kind, without regard to the form of action or pleadings.”</p>

    <p id="b424-6" data-blocks='[["BL_424.6",424,[360,482,1158,301]]]'>Were these purposes incompatible with the compulsory arbitration law ? There is nothing in the Act of Assembly to make them so. Arbitrators cannot assume jurisdiction beyond the boundaries of the cause referred to them, and if they blunder into matters outside of the submission, their award is void as to such excess, but a submission under the statute enlarged by agreement of parties is opposed to nothing in the statute.</p>
    <p id="b424-7" data-blocks='[["BL_424.7",424,[360,781,1159,989]]]'>True, the Acts of 1705 and 1806, if they are not repealed by the Act of 1836, and if they are, the first seven sections of the Act of 1836 provide for modes of arbitration by the concurrence of the parties litigant. Such also is arbitration at common law. In these cases the jurisdiction of the arbitrators is derived from the consent of the parties, whilst the peculiarity of the compulsory mode is that it originates in the will of one of the parties. He forces arbitration on his adversary without regard to his wishes, and hence it is called compulsory arbitration. But when the forum is fixed, its character is determined. It has been called into being by the agreement and concurrence of the parties, and all its proceedings are subject to the provisions of law which relate to such arbitration, or it has been established by one of the parties acting through the provisions of law that relate to compulsory arbitration. That is the latest point of time — the establishment of the tribunal — to which we can refer in determining its nature. Then we look at the proceedings which led to it, and determine whether it was a reference at common law under our old statutes, under the provisions of the Act of 1836 for voluntary arbitration, or under the provisions of the same act for compulsory arbitration. The jurisdiction has then attached, and however it may be enlarged or narrowed by the subsequent consent of the parties, the <em>nature </em>of the arbitration is not changed.</p>

You had the right of appeal when you began, and you had the right to an award on the matters in controversy in this suit, but you have surrendered them in consideration of your adversary’s surrender of the same rights. There can be no reason assigned for releasing parties from such an agreement that would not dissolve any other. And no agreement can be enforced if such an one may be violated.

The policy in Pennsylvania has been to encourage arbitration, and Courts have inclined to a liberal construction of the Acts of Assembly which relate to them. It is moreover to the public interest that an end be put to litigation, and that multiplicity of suits be discouraged. When, therefore, parties come before arbitrators chosen to decide a particular controversy in a pending action, see the men who are to be their judges and jurors, and voluntarily agree to submit <em>all </em>matters in controversy between them to be passed upon in that action, and especially, when they relieve the Court from all future embarrassment arising out of the pleadings, by mutually giving up the right of appeal, all interests both public and private, and all principles both of reason and law, concur in sanctioning their apt and terminating their discords.</p>

      <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>Now, instead of revoking the submission or applying to the Court to set it aside, the plaintiffs went to trial under the enlarged submission, and took their chance for an award in their favor. When found to be against them they filed fourteen exceptions to it in Court, no one of which contained a suggestion of want of authority in their attorneys to make the submission, and now it appears on the record for the first time as an assignment of error. It cannot be entertained without disregarding the whole current of decisions: Herman <em>v. </em>Freeman, 8 <em>Ser. &amp; R. 9; </em>Vankirk <em>v. </em>McKee, 9 <em>Barr </em>100; Christman <em>v. </em>Mason, <em>Id. </em>487; Rogers <em>v. </em>Playford, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Jones%20181" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Jones 181">2 <em>Jones </em>181</a>.</p>
    <p id="b426-6" data-blocks='[["BL_426.6",426,[359,886,1160,302]]]'>But it cannot, with propriety, be conceded that the submission was beyond the authority of counsel. The authorities are not so, and therefore, even if the objection now taken for the first, were in time, it could not avail the plaintiffs. Besides the eases referred to in the opinion of the Court of Common Pleas, and several already cited in this opinion, I refer to Wilson <em>v. </em>Young, 9 <em>Barr </em>101; Grier <em>v. </em>Bilger, 1 <em>Harris </em>58.</p>
    <p id="b426-7" data-blocks='[["BL_426.7",426,[358,1188,1158,416]]]'>Having thus disposed of the questions raised on this record, I shall not discuss the exceptions to the award, overruled in the Court below, nor the powers of attorney mentioned in the argument, and much less the evidence on which the arbitrators proceeded. It is possible the award did injustice to the plaintiffs. I confess to a lurking suspicion to that effect, but, to adopt the language of Judge Bell in Rogers <em>v. </em>Playford, if injustice has been done, it is the result of a course of investigation and power of determination to which the plaintiffs voluntarily submitted themselves.</p>
