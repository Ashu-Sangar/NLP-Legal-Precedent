It is contended, on behalf of the exceptants, that in cases when the interests of minors are to be affected, it is necessary to give notice, in accordance with the directions of the 53d section of the Act of 29th March, 1832, in relation to Orphans’ Courts. This section, and the preceding one, must be taken together, and they provide for giving notice in cases where no other method is specially provided; but in the succeeding section, viz. the 54th, the notice to be given in sales of real estate, by order of Orphans’ Court for the payment of debts, is distinctly stated, viz. by publication in a newspaper' or newspapers and handbills. This does not contemplate specific notice to the heirs or devisees, whether such heirs or devisees be minors or adults. This has been the uniform construction given to the act by the profession, so far as my knowledge goes. The order is made upon the application of the executor or administrator, if the Court is satisfied of its necessity and the requirements of the Act of Assembly in relation to schedules, &amp;c. aré complied with. The public notice of the sale is supposed to be sufficient, and those interested can be heard at any time before confirmation. They will be permitted, even after a sale, to show either that the debts have been paid, that their lien has been lost, or that there was no necessity to raise the money to pay debts, &amp;c.</p>

All that is required is, that the executor shall have exhibited to the Court a true and conscionable appraisement of all the personal estate of the decedent, together with a full statement of all the real estate of the same which has come to his knowledge, as also a just and true account, upon oath or affirmation, of all the debts of the decedent which have come to his knowledge.’</p>
