A small stream passed from the residue of plaintiff’s farm, easterly through the five acres, which were bounded on the south and west by said farm. Hull erected a dam on the five acres, diagonally across the stream, and extending westerly to his west line. This dam was for the purpose of driving a saw-mill. It flowed the water back westwardly and southwardly beyond the line of the five acres, upon plaintiff’s land, and in high water caused it to flow over plaintiff’s land, and eastwardly into the stream again below the dam. To prevent this overflow, a dam or an embankment was extended by Hull from the west end of the dam, westwardly several rods on plaintiff’s land; whether with plaintiff’s consent or not, it was alleged, was a disputed question in the first suit. This had the effect to flow the water further west on plaintiff’s land, and when the dam was full it flowed round the end of the embankment, southwardly and eastwardly, over plaintiff’s land. On the first day of April, 1845, Hull sold his article of agreement and right in the land to the defendant, Langley, who continued to keep up the dam and flow the water on the land of the plaintiff as before.</p>

The defendant claimed a right to do so by virtue of an alleged <em>parol license </em>from plaintiff to Hull, and also by a written agreement between the plaintiff and Hull, dated March 15, 1845; and gave evidence respecting such license, and also to show that plaintiff had not been injured. The plaintiff, in reply, gave evidence to disprove'the alleged parol license, and to show that the written agreement (in which he alleged the parol agreement, if there ever had been any, was merged), had been disowned and repudiated by defendant, and not complied with. The jury found a general verdict for the plaintiff, assessing the damages at fifty cents, and judgment was thereon entered. It was alleged that the first suit was brought to settle the disputed question of right, and not to recover damages to any greater amount than was necessary to accomplish that object; and that the jury were so told by the plaintiff’s counsel. The period for which damage was claimed in that suit was from the 13th day of February to the 9th of April, 1847.</p>

      <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>The essence of the charge in that action is, that the defendant had no right to maintain his dam so as to flood the plaintiff’s land or any part of it, and this charge appears to be sustained by the judgment. But now the defendant alleges that there was then a flooding at the south and also at the west, and. that, though the right at both points was in controversy, and was submitted to the jury, yet the verdict applies to only one of them; and the jury, in the present, case, were directed to inquire whether this was so.</p>
    <p id="b511-6" data-blocks='[["BL_511.6",511,[144,765,1163,764]]]'>If such an inquiry is proper then, it is not easy to see how one judgment can ever be conclusive in an action of nuisance, or in any other action. As well might it be said of a suit on several promissory notes of $100 each, with a recovery of only $100, that the verdict applies to only one of them, and allow the plaintiff to sue again on the others. But we need no better illustration of the difficulty than this case affords. It is assumed to be doubtful whether the former verdict finds a nuisance on the west, or on the south, or on both; and it is left to this jury to decide how this is. They decide in favor of the defendant, which means, that the former verdict did not apply to both sides, and that the defendant Has still a right to flood one or other of them; but which of them no one can tell. We have now, therefore, two judgments, both inconclusive, and therefore the strife may still go on. This cannot be. The judgment must, if possible, be conclusive of, something. What that something is must be defined, not by guessing at the intention of the jury, but by the matters in dispute and the verdict which decides them.</p>
    <p id="b511-7" data-blocks='[["BL_511.7",511,[148,1538,1161,516]]]'>The pleadings show that the matter in dispute was the wrongful flooding of the plaintiff’s land, and that is decided in his favor. The evidence must show what land, and it does show, that on the trial the defendant asserted a right to flood a part of the land, and submitted the evidence of his right to the jury; and of course they decided it. How ? There is no verdict in his favor, but a general one against him. The inference is inevitable, that his claim was found against him; for he might have asked, by plea or otherwise, that they should find this fact specially, and he ought to have done so, and then also it would have been conclusive ‘for or against him. It was found one way or the other, and the conclusive presumption is that the verdict shows which way.</p>
    <p id="b511-8" data-blocks='[["BL_511.8",511,[148,2053,1161,217]]]'>In an issue on a declaration or plea founded on a former judgment, the only proper subject to be submitted to the jury is, whether or not the matter in dispute in the present action is the same that was litigated in the former one. With this fact found, the Court must decide upon the effect of the former judgment.</p>
    <p id="b511-9" data-blocks='[["BL_511.9",511,[150,2270,1158,86]]]'>These principles are all that are material in the present case, and they require a reversal of this judgment.</p>
    <p id="b511-10" data-blocks='[["BL_511.10",511,[486,2355,780,44]]]'>Judgment reversed and a new trial awarded.</p>
