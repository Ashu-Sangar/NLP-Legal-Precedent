Above two years after the date of the agreement, the vendor delivered his deed for the tract of land surveyed in the name of Samuel Gibson (being part of two tracts, &amp;c.), containing 430 acres 10 perches and allowance. On the day of its delivery, the vendees agreed, in writing, that, if the Gibson survey should include more than 400 acres and allowance, they would pay to the vendor $13 per acre for said excess; and the vendor, by a written instrument or bond, bound himself to pay to the vendees $3 per acre for every acre included in the Gibson survey, and within the lines of his two surveys which shall be recovered , in two ejectments then pending. In those ejectments 52 acres and 55 perches and allowance were recovered from the vendor; but there still remained in the Gibson survey, exclusive of the quantity recovered, 400 acres 72 perches and allowance.</p>

Four hundred acres and allowance, were the basis of their treaty. That quantity had been paid for in the $1000. When the ejectments should he decided, and the lines should be fixed, whatever deficiency or excess should appear, on comparison with that standard, should be paid for at the rates stipulated. It was like a wager on the ultimate effect of the deed. If it should prove to be a good title to more than 400 acres and allowance, Cummings was to have $13' per acre for the excess; if for less, he was to pay $3 the acre for the deficiency.
