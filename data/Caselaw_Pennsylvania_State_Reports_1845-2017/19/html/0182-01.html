      <em>Charge of the Court. </em>— “ The history of this case, as detailed in the evidence, is as follows: — William Smith, the father of the parties, now about 90 years old, was, in 1846, the owner of the land in controversy. He had several children, all of whom were provided for and settled in life, except Henry, the defendant, and Betsey, an invalid sister of the parties. According to the current of the evidence it seems to have been understood that Henry was to have this property, and live with, and take care of, the old people. He appears to have been a favorite of his father, who desired him to have the property. This arrangement, according to some of the testimony, appears to have been understood by the family in 1846. Henry being about to leave for the south, if was suggested by William Smith that the business should be settled before he left. Joseph, one of the plaintiffs, according to the evidence of William Smith, Sr., assented to it, and a bond or agreement between the father and Henry was drawn and executed, to which Joseph was a subscribing witness. This paper, in form a bond, was acknowledged on the 19th of August, 1846. It bound the father to convey the farm and the chattels thereunto belonging, to Henry; provided the said Henry W. Smith do return with his family in the spring or summer of 1847, purposely to provide for and maintain the said William Smith, his wife Sarah, and their daughter Betsey, for life, and give a bond, with good security, for the faithful performance of the same; also to liquidate or discharge all debts now pending against the property of the said William Smith, together with all debts necessary for their support till the return of the said Henry W. Smith.</p>

If the jury find in the affirmative, then it is objected by the plaintiffs, that such an agreement is void by the statutes of frauds, being only in parol and not in writing. The plaintiffs’ counsel here interpose their second point. But we do not see, even if such a reservation or trust could not be created by parol, and the case of Murphy <em>v. </em>Herbert, 7 <em>Barr </em>421, seems to affirm the contrary, that that consideration is necessarily drawn into the case. The point is predicated upon the position that there was no obligatory writing between William Smith and Henry, or, rather, that the obligation was absolutely void and annulled by the simple failure of Henry to return and enter into the obligations proposed, <em>on the day </em>when the bond required.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b189-5" data-blocks='[["BL_189.5",189,[175,423,1171,1500]]]'>
      <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>“ That it was competent for William Smith to extend, by parol, the time for performance of the contract on the part of Henry, is very clear; and if he could do so, and, on transferring the property to plaintiffs, who well knew the contents of the obligation, did so extend it, and they consented to take it subject to the rights of Henry, then, so far as this point is concerned, it is the same as if the time for his return, and compliance, had been inserted in the obligation. It is true that, as affirmed in the first of plaintiffs’ points, time was material, and the father, if Henry did not return, might have made, after the summer had passed, any other arrangement, and transfer the property, discharged of his obligation, to Henry. But it was with the father to determine this. He might extend the time, or sell, or otherwise dispose of the property, if he pleased; and Henry could not have prevented it. The first point is correctly stated in the terms of it, and is applicable to the case, upon the supposition that there was no understanding for extending the time for compliance by Henry. The Court, therefore, instruct the jury that, <em>if, at the time the deed was made to the plaintiffs, it ivas agreed that they should transfer to Henry upon his return, </em>it would leave them in the same situation, as if the time mentioned in the proviso to the bond had not then expired. That obligation, being under seal, was valid; and if, with notice of its provisions, the plaintiffs took the conveyance, upon compliance with the terms of the agreement by Henry, he would, if in possession, be entitled to hold the land. If out of possession, equity would decree a conveyance by them to Henry; or, under our law, he might recover in ejectment. Henry returned in the summer of 1849, and in the fall of that year brought his family and took possession. He gave his bond, with William Smith, Jr., as his security, upon the conditions contained in the original obligation. With this security the father expressed himself satisfied, and desired that the plaintiffs should transfer the property to Henry. This they ought to have done, if they took the deed with the agreement so to do. They objected until they should be paid for advances which they affirmed they had made, and debts paid for the father.</p>

When the plaintiffs took the deed, they also took all the personal estate, <em>but they gave no agreement to pay any debts. </em>The only condition of their obligation is to support the father, mother, and daughter, The creditors of the father would have a right to collect their debts from his property in the hands of the plaintiffs. The property would be liable for the debts in their hands; but if there were other property of the father, it would be liable to them or to the creditors. <em>The payment of the debts was not a part of the consideration expressed in the contracts with the plaintiffs. </em>If <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>they paid debts, therefore, or if the father owed them, it was not a part of the arrangement to charge those.debts upon the land. If the defendant holds the land, he has it subject to all these debts due on the 18th August, 1846, and the expenses of supporting the family afterwards. For this, so far as paid by the plaintiffs, and so far as due to the plaintiffs, they are in the situation of creditors, and have all legal remedies for enforcing their payments. The property in his hands is chargeable with these debts, and can be made responsible for it. Nor can the plaintiffs be called upon, when they sue for those debts, to account for the personal property. That was assigned upon the consideration of the bond for the maintenance, and not for payment of the debts. The question may be raised if a claim for support since 21st September, 1847, should be made, whether the plaintiffs have not received full payment. That will be the proper time for that settlement, or, perhaps, in an account for the property between the parties. It is sufficient for the present, that, under all the evidence, the account for supporting the family, for debts paid, and for personal property received, is not to be settled in this case. The defendant <em>is not to have, therefore, a conditional verdict, for, by his contract, he was not bound to fay them, </em>nor were they entitled to demand from him any money before conveyance. <em>If they agreed to convey on the return of Henry, </em>then they were in the situation of the father, and could claim of Henry nothing which the old man might not have demanded. They could not demand security to themselves personally. The security was to be given to the father. On taldng the deed they gave the bond. <em>They gave no obligations for debts, and all they would be entitled to would be to have their bond given up. </em>As has been already stated, the claim for the debts can be enforced upon the property in the hands of Henry, and he must answer as well in the property, if he holds it, as under his bonds.</p>

It was sought to defeat the plaintiffs by setting up an alleged equitable title. Defendant’s bond was to be given in 1846 to pay debts, and yet in 1850 he was neither ready nor willing to pay. The alleged arrangement in September, 1847, was uncertain in its terms and stipulations. He who alleges a parol contract is bound to show certainly the terms and stipulations of it. If the declarations of the plaintiffs be taken to ascertain upon what terms they are willing to let him have it back, then he was to reimburse them their payments and expenses; and that placed the cause in a condition for special verdict.</p>

If William Smith extended the time for Henry’s return, and the plaintiffs took the deed subject to the bond and extension (upon which point the case was fairly submitted to the jury), Henry was bound, upon his return, in order to entitle him to the property, to perform no other obligations than those imposed upon him by the proviso in the bond, unless imposed by William <em>Smith, which </em>was not the case. <em>“ </em>If the plaintiffs have not already been compensated for any debts they may have paid, and for supporting the family,” the conveyance to Henry cannot defeat their right to look to the property for the payment of their claims.

It seems to be a conceded point that William Smith conveyed the legal title of this land to the plaintiffs by the deed of 21st September, 1847, as means of obtaining that support for himself and family, and the relief from pressing debts, which his son Henry W. Smith, the defendant, had bound himself to supply; and that the plaintiffs made advances to the old man on the faith of the title. The plaintiffs knew that old Mr. Smith desired his son Henry to have the farm, and that he had entered into a covenant to convey it to him on conditions of support and payment of debts; but when it became necessary for them to take up and perform the duties which Henry neglected, they naturally looked to the legal title as adequate indemnity for their expenditures. They hold the title still, and the defendant can obtain it only by showing that he has done those things which were to entitle him to receive it. If he would have equity, he must do equity. What he was to do is plainly expressed in the bond which he accepted from William Smith, of August 18, 1846. If the plaintiffs have performed these conditions for him in whole or in part on the faith of the legal title conveyed to them, a chancellor would never decree a conveyance over to the defendant till he had compensated them for performing his conditions. In Pennsylvania we accomplish the equity through conditional verdicts, which a chancellor would administer by decree. This was peculiarly a case for a conditional verdict, and since both parties desired it, the Court, even if their scruples had been well founded, ought not to have refused it. In ascertaining the amount to be paid by the defendant to the plaintiffs, the jury will have nothing to do with the general accounts between the parties, nor with liens on the property, which the plaintiffs may hold independently of their arrangement of September 1847 with William Smith; but the inquiry will be limited to compensation for such performance as the plaintiffs may prove of the conditions, mentioned in the bond of the 18th August, 1846, and for such other advances as they may have made on the faith of the title conveyed to them. The aggregate of these advances, lessened by whatever they received from either real or personal estate, will be the measure of Henry’s liability to them. The jury will add interest or not, as under all circumstances they think proper. And on payment to the plaintiffs of the sum so ascertained, in such reasonable time as' a jury may appoint, the defendant will be entitled to receive from the plaintiffs a conveyance of the title.</p>
