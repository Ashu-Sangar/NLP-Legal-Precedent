A., a subsequent owner of the part of lot No. 1 referred to, alleging that the passage over lot No. 2 was obstructed by the said building, brought an action against the owners of lot No. 2 for passing along <em>the private alley </em>after the said obstruction was made.

Stichter and James McKnight for interfering with or disturbing his right of way, along a private alley bounding his lot in the rear. His lot was <em>a part </em>of a lot No. 1, fronting on Penn street, in Reading, the other part of the lot being situate on the corner of Penn and Callowhill streets. His portion of said lot was about 28 feet in width and extended 100 feet back to the private alley, laid out in the rear of the lot, of which alley he had the use in common with other owners of parts of the same lot. John Bishop was the owner of' lot No. 1, being 60 feet front on Penn Street, and extending 200 feet in depth along Callowhill street. In 1791 he divided it, and laid off the private alley 100 feet back from Penn street, laying off lots on each side of the alley. In 1791 he sold to John Shenfelder a part on Penn street, adjoining lot No. 2, viz., 28 feet front on Penn by 100 feet deep, with a right to the ten feet alley in question, in common with other parts of his lot No. 1; and in 1794 he sold the part on the corner of Penn and Callowhill streets to Collinson Read, who afterwards conveyed to the county commissioners with a right to the said alley. ■ Gr. De B. Keim, who was owner of the lot No. 2, in 1809 or 1810, made an arrangement with Shenfelder to use the alley in common, he for the grain business in which he was engaged, and Shenfelder to use a part of Keim’s lot No. 2, for his stove and tin business, and for hauling through lot No. 2, in and out from Penn street. Keim had a gate put up on the private alley on the line of lot No. 2, and also a gate on Penn street, and Shenfelder and Keim used the alley and yard on lot No. 2, until the death of Shenfelder, and afterwards until 1842, when Keim sold to Stichter and McKnight. The latter had a building erected over lot No. 2, from Penn street back 140 feet. A passage way of about seven feet wide was left through the building. . This way was entered from Penn street by a door, and another door was placed at the end to connect with the ten feet alley. After this, Ebner, who became owner of the lot formerly owned by Shenfelder, and Hoff, who became owner of the other part of the lot No. 1, had a bar <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>placed across the alley at the line of lot No. 2, which was removed by the defendants, and an action was brought against them by Ebner for so doing.</p>

He stated that in making that arrangement nothing was said about building over lot No. 2. That he did not understand it to be such as to prevent him, his heirs, or assigns from doing so. That Peter, the son of Shenfelder, passed over lot No. 2, after his father’s death.</p>

Keim and Jacob Long, then their verdict should be for the plaintiff; and more especially if they find that the defendants, within five years, and after they became the owners of lot No. 2, altered and abridged the yard or lot through which the said Shenfelder and the plaintiff passed in and out from Penn street.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b23-10" data-blocks='[["BL_23.10",23,[220,1202,1170,214]]]'>2. That if the jury believe, that the use of the alley was by the permission and consent of the said Shenfelder, then neither George Be B. Keim, nor the defendants under him, acquired any right by lapse of time. To acquire such a right, the user must be adverse to and in hostility of the owner of the easement.</p>

If they had no right to use the alley, then the plaintiff could maintain this action. To warrant Keim in using the alley for his grain business, it was necessary to acquire, from the other owners of the right of passage, permission to use it. The commissioners agreed, and with Shenfelder an arrangement was made by him: That if this license or permission was carried into effect by Keim, by making alterations and improvements upon the faith of it, it was not revocable by Shenfelder. That the right, which Keim gave to Shenfelder to pass over his lo.t No. 2, was a valuable consideration. Also, that if the defendants have done anything to prejudice any right of Ebner, that the law will afford, a remedy; and that the owners of lot No. 2 were not bound to keep the lots in the same condition they were in in 1809; that all that could be required of them would be a reasonable passage way for the enjoyment of the easement across lot No. 2.</p>

This is not a case of mutual and dependent covenants, where one party is not bound to perform if the other fails. But it is a case of vested, executed rights, which one party claims to have forfeited, because a kindred right of his has been encroached upon, though not taken away. It would not prevent, but rather foster litigation, to sanction such a principle. And there is no necessity for it; for the law gives an adequate remedy for such encroachments, by action. To allow one party to revoke the other’s rights' for a mere encroachment, would be to hold out inducements to undertake reprisals, that must, in the nature of things, result in open war. It would be a rule incapable of definition, and therefore liable to continual abuse. Under the smallest annoyances, which must occasionally arise between tenants in common, the right of revocation would be claimed and suits would be the natural consequence. The cause was properly tried. The plaintiff’s remedy is by action.for the*obstruction of the other part of the alley, and not by revocation of the use of the part granted to the defendants.</p>
