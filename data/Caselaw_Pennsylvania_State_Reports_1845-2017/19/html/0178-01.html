That there is apparent on the face of the note, such an alteration in its date as throws upon the plaintiff the duty of explaining it by proof, that it was made previous to the defendant’s endorsement; and it is claimed, that in the absence of such explanatory proof, the plaintiff cannot recover ; so we are called upon to charge you. Doubtless an alteration in the date of a negotiable note, after it bad been endorsed, would be such a material alteration as would discharge the endorser; but this note presents no such marks of alteration as make it necessary for the plaintiff to offer explanatory proof. The date is disfigured by a blot, on which one of the figures is made, and very few written instruments are free from similar defects. If Courts were to hold such blots and ink marks as evidence of alteration requiring explanatory proof, not one-half the contracts and written instruments made between men, could be enforced in a Court of law.</p>

The Court think differently, and say to you that the notice of non-payment in this case is either good or bad in law, according as you shall find the fact, whether Smith gave to the bearer of it, the instructions complained of or not. If you believe that he instructed the bearer of this notice to say to the clerk of the defendant what he said about not opening the letter, then the notice was insufficient in law, and the plaintiff cannot recover. If, on the other hand, you believe that Mr. Smith gave no such instructions, but merely charged the messenger with carrying and delivering the letter, then the notice was good, and the plaintiff is in law entitled to recover. The law does <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>not hold the plaintiff answerable, nor are his rights here to be affected by any false or idle message which may have been delivered with the notice, and which was wholly without warrant or authority. If the plaintiff’s agent or attorney, Mr. Smith, charged his messenger with the simple duty of carrying and delivering this notice, then the plaintiff is responsible only for its timely and proper delivery, and not for what the messenger chose, of his own accord, to say about its not being opened by the clerk.”</p>

That the note in question here was altered. in the date can be seen at a glance, and, inasmuch as no evidence was given to explain it, the jury should have been instructed that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>
    <p id="b182-11" data-blocks='[["BL_182.15",182,[367,1469,1152,632]]]'>Another objection to the judgment is, that the notice to the endorser, of non-payment by the maker, was insufficient. The holder’s attorney sent the notice under seal to the endorser’s place of business, by a messenger who delivered it to a person in the employment of the endorser, telling him not to break the seal, but to keep it until the endorser should return home. This was no notice to the endorser until he actually received it. It might as well have been kept in the holder’s pocket as in the shop of the endorser, if its contents were not to be known. The judge of the Common Pleas thought that if the messenger exceeded his instructions in saying that it should not be opened, the notice was good enough. But we are of opinion that the sufficiency of the notice depends on what the messenger did, not on what he was instructed to do; on the message that was delivered, not on that which was sent.</p>
