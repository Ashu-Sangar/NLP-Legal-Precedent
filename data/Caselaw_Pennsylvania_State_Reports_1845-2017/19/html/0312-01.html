    <p id="b317-9" data-blocks='[["BL_317.13",317,[167,1606,1162,338]]]'>Some judges have said and decided, that where a vessel is so much injured by the perils of navigation that she is compelled to put into port to refit, in such a case, the wages and provisions of the crew during the detention are a subject of general average: 2 <em>Caine’s Rep. </em>263, 274; <a href="/mass/4/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Mass. 548" data-case-ids="2004047" data-case-paths="/mass/4/0480-01">4 <em>Mass. </em>548</a>; but this point has generally received a contrary decision: <a href="/johns/11/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="11 Johns. 315" data-case-ids="2137624" data-case-paths="/johns/11/0315-01">11 <em>Johns. </em>315</a>; <a href="/mass/43/0140-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Met. 140" data-case-ids="2041015" data-case-paths="/mass/43/0140-01">2 <em>Met. </em>140</a>; 4 <em>Ad. &amp; Ellis </em>420; 31 <em>Eng.

The duty to have a competent crew, and for them to do all that is reasonably possible for the safety and delivery of the cargo is essentially involved in the relation of carrier, and upon its performance depends the earning of freight, and for its performance freight is the consideration. Their wages fall on the freight: <a href="/johns/7/0431-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="7 Johns. 431" data-case-ids="369165" data-case-paths="/johns/7/0431-01">7 <em>Johns. </em>431</a>.</p>

And in case of shipwreck, it is their duty to use their best exertions to save as much as possible: <em>Abbott on Shipping </em>451. Beside this, they lose the whole wages of the voyage if they desert, or so misbehave as to justify a discharge; or if the vessel be captured or totally lost. While on the other hand they are entitled to full wages in time of sickness, and to wages for the whole voyage if improperly discharged, or if the voyage be improperly broken up by the master or owners; and if the vessel be wrecked, and a part of it or of its cargo be saved by their exertions, they are entitled to a proportion of their wages. Add to this that, by the rules of law, and substantially in this ease by the contract of insurance, the insurer is <em>not liable on his </em>policy for the safety of the ship unless she has a captain of competent skill and general good character, a crew competent for the voyage, and sufficient stores and supplies of provisions, and then we have all the elements necessary for a deduction of the proper rule of this case.</p>

    <p id="b319-8" data-blocks='[["BL_319.8",319,[150,968,1172,1076]]]'>. There is nothing to distinguish this case so as to exclude it from the operation of these principles. The special clause in the policy, stipulating that “ in case of loss, the assured, his factors, servants, and assigns, shall labor and travel for the safeguard and recovery of the vessel, to the charge whereof the assurers shall contribute,” has no proper influence on the'question. This is a usual clause in policies on vessels and on goods, here and in England: <em>Smith’s Merc.

It adds nothing to the duty of the insured and his agents, but merely expresses what would be the duty of the parties without it; that is, to use all proper exertions to save the property insured from total loss, and declares the duty of the insurer to contribute to the expense. It cannot apply to the crew, for they are not mentioned; yet their occupation is so prominent and peculiarly appropriate on such -occasions that they could hardly be intended to be included without being named. In the cases last above referred to it is not treated as influencing the question. It cannot apply to them in ease of insurance on goods, for they are not the servants of the owners of the goods. If it be construed to apply to them, it would entitle them to wages though their exertions should prove ineffectual, and thus a part of their wages would be insured, which the law does not allow. And if it apply to them in case of detention by reason of an injury, it is not easy to see why it should not apply to a case of detention by adverse winds, or by running on a bar where no injury is done to the vessel.</p>
