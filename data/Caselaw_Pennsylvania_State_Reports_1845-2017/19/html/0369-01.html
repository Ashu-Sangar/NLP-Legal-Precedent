From his express words, we see that he designed to grant to the devisee the use, during her life, unalienable, with remainder in fee to her heirs. This intention is too clear to admit of a doubt. The operative words are closely connected in a single sentence, and the latter clause restrains and modifies the meaning of the whole. One part cannot be separated from the other and rejected as repugnant. But if it could be so, it would be the first clause of the sentence (which seems to grant a foe-simple) that should be rejected; because, where there is repugnance in a will, the rule is that the latter of the repugnant provisions must be retained, and the former rejected.

Hence, many of the rules of law are designed to control and frustrate the most manifest intent. The great merit of the rule in Shelly’s case is, that it frustrates and is intended to frustrate unreasonable restrictions upon titles; for when an estate is declared to be a fee-simple or fee-tail, it is at once made subject to a limitation in its proper form, no matter how clear may be the testator’s intention to the contrary.</p>

And it would he exceedingly improper in any Court, in construing a devise to a man and his heirs, to endeavor to give effect to the restraint upon alienation by changing the character of the estate to a life estate, with a remainder annexed to it, or with an executory devise over.</p>
