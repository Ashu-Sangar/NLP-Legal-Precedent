A certain tract of land of an intestate was appraised under proceedings in the Orphans’ Court, and not being taken by any of the heirs, was sold under an order of the Orphans’ Court, in which the terms of sale were directed to be, “ One-half of the purchase-money to be paid in hand, and the residue in five equal annual payments.’’ No direction was given as to a charge of one-third of the purchase-money on the land. The purchasers gave to the administrators judgment bonds conditioned for the payment to the widow of the intestate of the interest of one third part of the purchase-money, and, at her death, the principal of the third to the administrators. One of the tracts was purchased 'at the sale for the use of certain minor heirs of the estate, by whom it was subsequently conveyed to another of the heirs, it being declared in the conveyance that the sum of $2713.19 remains charged on the premises during the life of the widow of the intestate, the interest thereof to be paid to her yearly, and at her death the said principal sum to be paid to the heirs of the intestate. <em>During the lifetime of the widow, </em>the land was sold on judgments obtained against the grantee for other claims unconnected with the partition, the judgments being obtained <em>after </em>the conveyance by the heirs. <em>After the death of the widow, </em>one of the heirs brought an action of assumpsit against the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale, to recover his share of the said principal sum payable after the widow’s death.</p>

      <em>“ </em>On these bonds judgments were entered in the Common Pleas of Lebanon county, in the years 1816 and 1817. These judgments were never revived. The whole of this land eventually came into the hands of John Bowman the younger, and was subsequently sold from him by the sheriff of Lebanon county, and conveyed to Levi Kline, the purchaser, by deed dated April 11, 1850. During the time that John Bowman held the land, he paid to the widow, his mother, her annual interest, in the room of dower; the last sum being paid in 1849. She died on the 9th of August, 1850. The first question to be determined is, whether the widow held a lien on the land during her lifetime, and the heirs one, for their distributive shares, after her death. By the common law the widow is entitled to dower out of all the lands of which her husband was seised during coverture. Of this no sale or order of court could deprive her without her consent. By the 22d section of the Act of the 19 th of April, 1794, it is provided, that if on partition, the land is awarded to any of the children of the deceased, the share of the widow shall be set apart and <em>remain charged upon the premises, </em>the interest to be paid her during her life, and after her death the principal be distributed amongst the heirs of the deceased. No provision was made in that act for a sale, in case none of the heirs would take the property at the appraisement. By the Act of the 2d of April, 1804, direction is given for selling the land, where none of the heirs will take it at the appraisement, <em>‘ </em>on such terms as the Court shall think proper to direct.’ By the 2d section of the Act it is provided, <em>inter alia, </em>to confirm the sale, ‘ subject and liable to the payment of the purchase-money, according to the terms prescribed by the Court in the order of sale, and the Court shall order the proceeds of such sale to be distributed in such manner as according to law and justice may be proper.’ This is a. supplement to the Act of 1794. By the Act of the 7th of April, <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>1807, it is further provided, that where each of the heirs takes a purpart, the interest of the widow shall be estimated by the inquest, and <em>remain a charge </em>on each of the shares, and when the estate is divided into fewer parts than there are heirs, it is in like manner charged; and in each case a remedy by distress or action is given for the recovery of the annual interest during the widow’s lifetime; and after her death provision is made for distributing the same among the heirs. The seventh section of the same Act provides for a sale according to the Act of 1804, if no one of the heirs will take the land at the appraisement. The Act of 1804 authorizes the Court to fix the time of payment, and declares that ‘ the land shall be subject and liable to the payment of the purchase-money, according to the terms prescribed by the Court in the order of sale.’ Under these provisions there is no doubt but the Court might have declared that the widow’s share should remain charged; but that was not done by express words. Was it a lien by implication ? This question has been frequently before the Supreme Court. Some of the cases arose since the Act of 1828, which will be hereafter referred to; others when there was an express reservation in favor of the widow in the order itself; some under the Act of 1794. In all of which cases the lien was recognised as remaining. But in Hawk <em>v. </em>Geddis, 16 <em>Ser. It. </em>23, the question arose under this same Act. There the Court made an order to sell for one-half in hand, the balance in five equal annual instalments. The hand-money was paid, and bonds given for the annual instalments; no judgments were entered on the bonds, but on a question which arose between the principal obligee and surety in the obligations, when it became necessary to determine whether a lien existed, Judge Duncan, who delivered the opinion, says that the sale is ‘ <em>subject and liable to the payment of the p-ur chase-money, the lien continues for the purchase-money, and the purchaser talces it subject to it.’ </em>Yet there was no <em>order </em>that it should be so. The judge declares that ‘ the lien is not cancelled, nor could it be by the administrators unless the money had been <em>actually </em>paid,’ although some seven years after the sale they gave an unconditional deed for the land, containing a receipt in full for the purchase-money. One of the judges dissented, but upon other ground. This same case was again before the' Supreme Court, and was overruled on the point raised in the first case by the dissenting judge; but the existence of the lien claimed in this case is fully recognised, both in the opinion of the Court, and that of another judge who dissented on other principles. ' We have then these two cases precisely in point. So far as regards <em>the lien </em>they do not appear to be overruled or shaken. The case most relied on, as affecting the principle of Hawk <em>v. </em>Geddis, is to be found in <a href="/watts/2/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Watts 263" data-case-ids="1840097" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0263-01">2 <em>Watts </em>263</a>, Eshelman <em>v. </em>Witmer; but that was an order to sell <em>for cash, </em>and the soundness of the other case is not <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>questioned. The action now trying possesses much stronger features of a lien than Hawk <em>v. </em>Geddis. There the deed was withheld at the time of sale, and was delivered after the term .of credit fixed by the Court had expired, accompanied with a receipt in full for the purchase-money. Here a deed is delivered at the time of sale, containing a provision that the same is <em>‘ </em>subject and liable to the payment of the purchase-money, according to the terms prescribed by the said order, as by the records of the same Court more fully and at large appears,’ which clearly showed that the purchase-money remained unpaid. Bonds were taken in both cases, which alike merged the simple contract debt arising from the bid. And' although in this case they were entered in the Common Pleas, yet the judgment was no more effectual merger of the debt than the bond. There is an additional equity in favor of these present obligations. The condition of payment of the amount annually due to the widow during life, and of the principal to the heirs after her death, is set forth in full in the bond, and copied into the record, so that every one who examined could see that the money now claimed would not fall due during the widow’s life. The lien of those judgments continued under the laws then in force, until the 23d day of March, 1830, being payable at a future period.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b32-6" data-blocks='[["BL_32.6",32,[387,1318,1166,1118]],["BL_33.1",33,[163,404,1162,390]]]'>“ The other deed under which John Bowman held the property, was made to him by his brothers and sisters, who became the owners, and bears date March 30, 1836. In it is full notice of the existence of this lien, and that the widow’s 'share remained charged. It is conveyed subject to the payment of interest on $2713.19 to the widow of John Bowman, deceased, during her life, and the principal to his heirs after her death. Mr. Kline has to claim through these two deeds. He has no other title to the lands. Yet if there was no lien originally, these reservations will not create one which can be enforced in this form of action. The character of the conveyance is mentioned to show that the claim presents a stronger equity than in Hawk <em>v. </em>Geddis. The Act of April 14,1828, seems to carry with it a legislative construction, that without an order, the lien does not continue. It provides, that where a Court orders a sale, it <em>shall </em>direct the interest of the widow to remain a lien, and the interest of one-third or one-half (according to her right) to be paid her during life, and the principal to be distributed among the heirs after her death. It has been argued that this would have been unnecessary, if the lien existed before; but the law provides a different remedy to enforce payment of the annual interest, than any which could have been pursued under the Act of 1804, a distress. Besides, the legislative construction of statutes is often not the true one, even when directly made; here it is only implied or inferred that they did consider that no lien existed. Hawk <em>v. </em>Geddis was decided but a year before, and was probably not reported when this law passed. It has certainly been generally <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>understood <em>by </em>the legal profession throughout the state, that a lien existed <em>without an express order to that effect; </em>and when we take into consideration that the Act of 1804 was hut supplemental to that of 1794, and the two required to form a system, it may-well he doubted whether it was necessary to create the lien by express words. The other Act gave it, and why repeat it in the supplement ? The decisions under the Act of 1804 are binding upon us, and even if we were dissatisfied with the reasoning of the Court, we must take it as a rule of law not to be disregarded.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b33-6" data-blocks='[["BL_33.6",33,[161,794,1165,513]]]'>“ Assumpsit is the proper form of action to enforce payment in the present case, and is correctly brought in the name of each heir, for his distributive portion. It should not be sued jointly. This suit is not brought on the reservation in the deed of 1836. The remedy under that reservation would bo either by covenant, treating it as a covenant real, running with the land, or by ejectment. But we consider it settled in Pennsylvania, that assumpsit will lie to enforce payment under the original lien. Stating the reservation in the deed of 1836 in the <em>narr. </em>is mere surplusage. Neither the original lien, nor that contained in the deed last referred to, can be taken out of the purchase-money at sheriff’s sale.

We think otherwise. A general conveyance without reservation would clearly pass it; and consequently, being vested in John, it would pass to ICline by the sheriff’s sale. By a fair construction of the reservation, Moses Bowman retains the right to himself. The land is transferred, ‘ under and subject that the sum of $2713.19 remains charged on the above-mentioned and described tract of land, during the natural life of Magdalena Bowman, the interest thereof to be paid to her yearly and every year, and at and immediately after her death, the principal sum of $2713.19 to be paid to the heirs and legal representatives or lawful owners of John Bowman, deceased.’ This may fairly be construed to reserve the payment of the whole sum of $2713.19 to the heirs and legal representatives of John Bowman, deceased, or the lawful owners of the land. The whole sum is reserved to all the heirs, the grantors included. All is to, be paid, of course all are to receive. It is nearly or quite as strong as an express reservation in favor of the grantor, which, it has been decided, does not pass his interest. The actual intention cannot be doubted, and we think it is sufficiently expressed. Prior to this conveyance, Moses Bowman had purchased an interest from the assignees of his brother, Samuel Bowman, and in conveying, reserved that interest, under the head of ‘ lawful owners.’ He is therefore entitled to recover (in addition <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>to his share in the whole fund) one-sixth part of Samuel Bowman’s interest in the 98 acres and 74 perches, vested in him by the deed of the assignees. The whole question is one of law, and you have only to make a calculation of the amount due, and render a verdict according to our direction.”</p>
