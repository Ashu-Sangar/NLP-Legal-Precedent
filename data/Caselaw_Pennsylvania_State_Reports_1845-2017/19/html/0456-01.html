There is always a presumption in favor of the acts of public officers and agents, under oath, which forbids an individual frbm making himself a judge in his own cause, and turning them out of peaceable possession of property taken and occupied for public use. This-possession, and the legal presumption in its favor, like a descent cast, tolls the entry of the former owner, and turns him around to his action.
