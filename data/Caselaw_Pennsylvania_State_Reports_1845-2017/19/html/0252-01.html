Previous to a marriage, a written contract was executed by the parties, in which the intended husband agreed that if he died first, he would order his executors or administrators to put $1000 to interest for the use of the female, whilst she remained his widow: and, further, that she should have a right to the household furniture which she may bring with her: and the female, on her part, agreed that she would “ <em>desire” </em>no more of the husband's <em>estate </em>than as above mentioned. In his will, the husband made provisions according to the contract. The wife, after the death of the husband, <em>released, </em>the executors from all claim against the estate of her late husband, real or personal, except the annual interest, acknowledging the receipt of most of her personal property,* and payment in lieu of the residue of it: <em>Held, </em>that the word <em>estate, </em>as usod in the marriage contract, was not limited to <em>real estate, </em>but included both real and personal.</p>

On the same day, but previous to the marriage, a writing was signed by them, purporting to be a marriage contract, in which it is stated that, in consideration of certain engagements on his part, she “ shall desire no more of Jacob Shoch’s estate.” On the 20th of January, 1849, said Jacob made his last will and testament, which, after his death, to wit, on the 18th day of December, 1850, was proved. In the will he bequeathed to her the interest of $1000, to be paid to her yearly, during her life or widowhood, being what was mentioned in the written agreement aforesaid. This she refused to accept; and after the year had expired from the time of her husband’s death, she had the executors cited to file an account. The inventory of the personal estate amounted to upwards of $10,000. They filed an answer, and the Court directed an issue to the Common Pleas, to try whether she was entitled to one-third of the personal estate, and dower in the real estate, or to either.</p>

He further engaged, that if he died before her, she should have the right to remove all the household furniture she may bring with her.

The word “estate,” in the marriage contract of the 2d October, 1832, was not used in the sense which confines it to the real estate of the husband; but, when taken in connection with the other parts of the agreement, must be understood as embracing his whole estate, real and personal. The fair construction of the agreement is, that the wife, in consideration of the provisions contained in it for her benefit, and for the benefit of her children by a former husband, accepts of those provisions in lieu of her claims upon his real and personal estate under the intestate laws, and releases all further demands. It is true that in ancient times “real estate was the principal favorite; and our first legislators entertained a low and contemptuous opinion of all personal estate. There is not a chapter in Britton, or the Mirror, that is devoted to a discussion of the rules which govern this species of property; and the little that is to be found in Grlanvil, Bracton, and Eleta, seems principally borrowed from the civilians. But of later years, since the introduction and <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>extension of trade and commerce, which are entirely occupied in this species of property, and have greatly augmented its quantity, and of course its value, we have learned to conceive different ideas of it:" <em>2 </em>Bl. 385. Courts now regard a man’s personalty in a light nearly if not quite equal to his realty, and have adopted a more enlarged anc] less technical mode of considering the one and the other: 2 <em>Bl. </em>385. Under this change of circumstances the word <em>“ </em>estate,” when used in an instrument of writing, is no longer understood as referring exclusively to real estate, but may properly embrace real and personal estate, if such be the intention of the parties. That this was the intention in the ease before us, is too clear for argument.</p>
    <p id="b257-6" data-blocks='[["BL_257.6",257,[180,933,1163,602]]]'>There is nothing in the agreement which renders it void on account of its tendency to restrain marriage. We cannot close our eyes to the fact that its object was to promote a marriage, and we infer from the evidence that it was the means of accomplishing that desirable result. With this evidence of its wholesome tendency in this particular, we do not perceive the logical propriety of condemning it for an opposite one. And after the plaintiff has enjoyed all the advantages of the contract during her husband’s life, and by virtue of its provisions has since his death resumed the possession of the personal property which belonged to her before marriage, and executed a release to her husband’s executors of all claims except those held under the contract, there is a principle of natural justice which estops her from impeaching it. Honesty is always the best policy.</p>
