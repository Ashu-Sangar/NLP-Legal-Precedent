The two Mehaffies were indebted on a judgment, amounting to about $777.28, and, their property being in danger of sale, the defendant was applied to for a loan of money. ITe agreed for the sum of $100 to advance the amount necessary. The sum of $100 was paid to Brestle or his counsel; the sum of $777.23 was paid to the attorney of the plaintiffs in the judgment, and the judgment was assigned to Brestle. On the same day his attorney obtained an amicable revival of the judgment. It was alleged by his counsel, in the Supreme Court, that the property of the Mehaffies was afterwards sold by the sheriff, and no more was claimed or received by Brestle than the sum of $677.23 advanced by him, and legal interest on that amount. The amount received by him was not, however, proved in the case.</p>

But it has been settled, both here and in England, that until the lender has received <em>more </em>than principal and interest, bonus included, for the sum actually advanced, the offence is not consummated. Judging from the evidence on our paper-book, it would <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>appear that not even the bonus had been received. To redeem their land from execution, the Mehaffies agreed with Brestle to get him an assignment of the judgment against them for a loan •less than the amount of the debt, the difference being made up by themselves. With the money borrowed, and the money advanced by them, they satisfied the execution, and the plaintiffs in the judgment assigned it to Brestle. Here the evidence stops. It was affirmed in the argument, that of the proceeds of the judgment, Brestle received the sum- he had advanced, with legal interest for it, and no more; and that the money put into the purchase of the judgment by the Mehaffies, was applied for their benefit to other liens on their land. Should that turn out to be the fact, it will result that the penalty has not been incurred; and the cause must, therefore, go to another jury for further development.</p>
