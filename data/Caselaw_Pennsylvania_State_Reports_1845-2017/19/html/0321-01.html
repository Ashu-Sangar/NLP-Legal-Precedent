    <p class="summary" id="b323-8" data-blocks='[["BL_323.8",323,[199,882,1160,557]]]'>'This action was brought by B. Coursin against John Walker, Jr., to recover the amount of two promissory notes for four hundred dollars each, drawn by Hunter &amp; Blackstock, to the order of B. Coursin, who endorsed and delivered them to William B. Walker. Coursin, being indebted to William B. Walker, agreed to let him have these notes, but refused to become responsible for them as endorser; or, in other words, William B. Walker was to take them upon the credit and responsibility of the drawers exclusively. In pursuance of this understanding, William B. Walker gave Coursin a written agreement that he would not hold him liable for said notes in case the said Hunter &amp; Blackstock should not pay them at maturity; and John Walker, Jr., the defendant, executed an instrument of writing, as follows:</p>

      <em>Samuel </em>Walker negotiated the notes with Bagaly &amp; Smith, in the ordinary course of business, for a valuable consideration, with the endorsement of Coursin, who therefore became liable to pay them on the default of the drawers. Hunter &amp; Blackstock having failed to lift the notes at maturity, Coursin, on the last day of grace, the notes being in bank for collection, lifted them without waiting for them to be protested, and then brought this suit against John Walker, Jr., on his guarantee, apd recovered a verdict and judgment against him.'</p>

He said that he would not lose, that <em>Samuel </em>was into the notes, they had come through him, and he would have to make them good, if he lost the money.

Did that justify the conclusion that he was responsible for the payment of them ? The absence of Samuel’s name from the notes is strong evidence that he was not, and did not intend to become liable for the payment of them. If, then, the conclusion of John Walker with regard to his rights and Samuel’s responsibility on these notes is erroneous, there is no evidence to disqualify the latter as a witness.</p>

    <p id="b325-6" data-blocks='[["BL_325.11",325,[205,603,1166,1376]]]'>Such statements of the party, if founded in matter of law, will not exclude the witness, if upon a full disclosure of the facts he appears to have no interest in the event of the suit. But where the facts are not fully disclosed, and the party pronounces his witness interested in the event, he necessarily draws into his own exclusive cognisance the law and fact involved in the question, and the Courts have no means of correcting the error, if there he one. This principle governs the case before us. It appears that the witness “was <em>into </em>the notes,” that they “ came through him,” and that his act in negotiating them so as to render the plaintiff below liable on his endorsement, contrary to the agreement, was the cause of the present controversy; but we are not informed of the extent to which he was “into the notes,” or of the circumstances under which the notes “ came through him.” It is therefore impossible to determine whether the party was in error in his declaration that “he would not lose,” and “that Samuel Walker would have to make the notes good if he (John Walker) lost the money!” Every intendment is to be made in favor of the decision of the Court below on a question of fact which was within its province to decide. Like arbitrators, or a jury, it enjoys the advantage of hearing and seeing the witnesses, and its decisions on questions of fact are not to be reversed in the appellate Court upon an imperfect note of the evidence, except for a clear and manifest mistake against its weight, such as would be ground for setting aside an award or a verdict. The Court may have inferred that the note in question was the property of Samuel Walker, and that, when he negotiated it, in violation of the contract, so as to make John Walker liable on' his endorsement, it was done under some agreement with the latter to indemnify him from the consequences. There was certainly sufficient evidence to justify the finding that he was under some legal engagement to that effect; and upon such a finding of the <em>fact, </em>the decision to reject him as incompetent was correct in point of law.</p>
