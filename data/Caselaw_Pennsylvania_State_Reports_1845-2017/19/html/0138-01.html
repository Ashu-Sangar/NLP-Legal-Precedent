An administration account was confirmed in 1821, and tlie balance directed to be distributed according to law. In this account were charged dividends on bank stock not then received. The surviving administrator died in 1834. In 1839, 1840, and 1841, citations were issued to the executors of the surviving administrator to settle his account on the estate of the first intestate. The citations were not served, in consequence of the executors residing in another county. In 1848 another citation was issued and served, and the executors, by order of the Orphans’ Court, filed an account.

After an answer and a replication, the Court adjudged the answer insufficient, and ordered the respondents to settle an account of the assets which had come into the hands of the administrators after the settlement of 1821.
