Grizella Neel, the wife of John Neel, had a life estate under his will. She was the widow of Thomas Neel. She entered upon the premises under the devise, and afterwards intermarried with John Neel, one of the parties to whom the remainder was limited, to take effect upon the death of Grizella Neel. That Archibald Neel is also one of the parties to whom the remainder is limited. The clauses in the will under which the controversy arose are as follows: “ I do bequeath as follows to my dear wife: I give and bequeath my right and title of the landed property on which I live, &amp;c. The landed property bequeathed to my wife during her lifetime, and at her death to fall back to my blood relations, my brothers and sisters.” The tract of land devised lies adjacent to the Monongahela river, and is accessible through land owned by John Neel and others, lying immediately in front of the same, and between the land devised and the river. During the life of Thomas Neel a coal pit was opened on the part of the tract remote from the river, and worked for family use and for the benefit of the neighbors; but it was alleged that a very inconsiderable quantity of coal was excavated. Thomas Neel cut and sold timber to some extent on the land.</p>

But when we turn to the decisions on the subject, we do not find that any such distinction is made between lessees for life, and other tenants for life. All the English authorities treat the subject as if the statutes extended to all kinds of tenants, and this is taken for granted in Woodman &amp; Good, 6 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>169.</p>

This is more clearly marked in the American cases, allowing tenants for life the privilege of cutting down timber in order to improve the land and fit it for cultivation. This, of course, increases the power and the profit of the tenant for life, and diminishes the control of the remainder-man. Yet this is subject to the rule of good husbandry, and does not violate the principle that the substance of the land is not to be taken away.</p>

Surely courts have no such control over the arrangements which people choose to make of their affairs. Usually an enterprising tenant for life may be of advantage to the remainder-man, but in the case of mines it may be the reverse. And I cannot see how the enterprise of the citizen is to be restrained by judicial process.

I know that it has been said that a lease of mines does not give a right to timber to work the mines: Darcy <em>v. </em>Askwith, <em>Hob. </em>234; <em>S. C. Hutt </em>19; 2 <em>Bulst. </em>279. But in cases of life estates in lands, with mines in them, the contrary has been held: 6 <em>Mun. </em>134; <a href="/citations/?q=2%20So.%20552" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2 So. 552">2 <em>South. </em>552</a>; 2 <em>Green’s Ch. R. </em>469.</p>
