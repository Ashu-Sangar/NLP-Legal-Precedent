There being no evidence of any offer to purchase at any price by the defendants, or the tender of any money on any such purchase, the Court decide that there is nothing in that clause- in the lease to render it a breach of any covenant on the part of the lessors to sell to the plaintiffs. The ease is distinguished from the case of Kerr <em>et al. v. </em>Day, 14 <em>Pa.
