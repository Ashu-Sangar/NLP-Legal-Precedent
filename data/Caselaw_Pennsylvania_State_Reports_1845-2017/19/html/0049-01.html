A testator, by his will dated in December, 1824, and proved in September, 1830, devised his estate equally among his three daughters. The share of one of them was devised to a person and his heirs in trust for the separate use of said daughter for life, to permit her to take the interest or income yearly and every year as they come due, for her separate use during her natural life. And he further directed, that after the decease of his daughter, her share (the one-third) should be divided among her children, share and share alike, as they arrive at the age of twenty-one years. The daughter died, leaving a husband and eight children, three of whom were minors. <em>The Orphans’ Court </em>decreed that the executor, who was also trustee, should pay out of the interest of the fund $150 for the past support of the three minor children, and the interest on the fund due to <em>two of them </em>to be applied to their future support and education. Afterwards, on the petition of the guardian, <em>the Court of Common Pleas, </em>of the same county, decreed that the said executor should pay to the guardian of two of said minor grandchildren “ $100 for their past support, and $14.88 interest.” The Court of Common Pleas awarded a fi. fa., under which the sums ordered to be paid were paid by the executor. On appeal, it was <em>held, </em>that though the legacies to the said grandchildren were <em>contingent </em>on their arrival severally at the age of twenty-one years, yet that the Court had power to decree that the <em>interest </em>on the amount payable to each on their attaining the age of twenty-one years, be paid to their guardian for their support and education respectively.</p>

We concur most cordially in the remark of Mr. Justice Coulter, in delivering the opinion of this Court, in Brown’s Appeal, that “ it is for the interest of society that there should be one tribunal to which parties can resort without being perplexed by such abstruse distinctions.” There is nothing in the decree of the Orphans’ Court which would move the conscience of a chancellor to set aside the subsequent proceedings in the Common Pleas. On the contrary, the decree of the Orphans’ Court, unreversed and unappealed from, should have the effect of settling conclusively, at least between the guardian and his wards, the propriety of appropriating the sums designated in the decree for their maintenance. The Orphans’ Court has a general jurisdiction over the persons and estates of minors, and over their guardians, as well as over the estates of decedents, and the accounts of executors and administrators ; and its decrees are not to be reversed in collateral proceedings. We see no injury likely to arise to the appellant from the preliminary proceedings in the Orphans’ Court; and the proceedings in the Common Pleas to enforce the decree can do him no harm, except in regard to a trifling increase of costs. These, being discretionary in a Court of Equity, and being always imposed upon the party in fault, can furnish no ground for reversing the proceedings. But the appellant has, by this proceeding, received, without objection, the advantage of an examination <em>de novo </em>into the main question, whether either Court has power to decree the payment of the interest, or any portion of it, for the maintenance of the legatees, until they arrive at the age of twenty-one years. This advantage would compensate for the increased costs, if the appellant were litigating for his own benefit; but as he is acting as trustee, and, it is presumed, desires only to preserve the fund for the parties entitled, the costs of these proceedings will he allowed him on settlement of his accounts. There is nothing irregular in the decree of the Common Pleas, or in the process issued to enforce it.</p>

But the exception is equally well settled with the rule, that where the legatee is a child of the testator, and a minor, incapable of supporting himself, or one to whom the testator has placed himself in <em>loco parentis, </em>and no special provision is made for the maintenance of the legatee, interest will be allowed on the legacy, although not payable until a future time, as, upon the legatee’s attaining full age.

So, where-a legacy has been given by a party who puts himself in <em>loco parentis, </em>the same doctrine holds as in the case of a legacy by a parent to a child: Acherly <em>v. </em>Vernon, 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>753; Beckford <em>v. </em>Tobin, 1 <em>Ves. Sen. </em>308; Hill <em>v. </em>Hill, 3 <em>Ves. &amp; B. </em>183; 2 <em>Roper </em>199; Ritzer <em>v. </em>Haber, 14 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>237; Ellis <em>v. </em>Ellis, <em>Sch.

Grandchildren have not always been regarded as having equal claims with children to this humane provision for their support, or to other equitable intervention founded on the same principle. In Kettle <em>v. </em>Townsend, 1 <em>Salk. </em>187, where one devised a copyhold, estate to his grandson, Lord Chancellor Sommers decreed the will good, and “ that equity ought to supply a surrender, <em>as well as in the case of a son ; </em>that a grandson was a son, and the grandfather was bound to provide for him.” The House of Lords reversed this decree, and held that equity ought not to supply this defect, unless it were in favor of a son or a daughter, and not then neither, <em>if it was to disinherit the eldest son.” </em>But in Watts <em>v. </em>Bullas, 1 <em>P. Wms. 60, </em>in 1702, the Master of the Rolls said that “such a devise ought to be made good for <em>grandchildren </em>as well as <em>children ; </em>and if the same case were to come <em>now </em>into the House of Lords, it would be so ruled, and that he had and would decree <em>so.” </em>The like was also declared by Lord Harcourt in Freestone <em>v. </em>Rant, <em>Trin. </em>1712; and in Fursaker <em>v. </em>Robinson, 1717, <em>Pre. Cha. </em>475, Lord Cowper doubted the authority of Kettle <em>v. </em>Townsend, in regard that the grandfather, by the Act of 43 Eliz., is bound to maintain his grandchild, which he said he believed was not taken notice of in that case: see Watts <em>v. </em>Bullas, 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>60, note. In Chapman <em>v. </em>Gibson, 3 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>229, Lord Alvanley said he did not see why a grandchild should not have the same equity, for the statute of Elizabeth has made it compulsory on the grandfather to provide for him. In Hills <em>v. </em>Downton, 5 <em>Ves. </em>557, 565, Lord Rosslyn expressed a strong opinion, against the decision of the House of Lords, And in Perry <em>v. </em>Whitehead, 6 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>546, in <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>1801, Lord Eldon said, “ the difficulty with me is this: can I, sitting here, contradict a decision of the House of Lords ?”</p>
    <p id="AWj" data-blocks='[["BL_58.6",58,[335,489,1171,1755]]]'>Fortunately for the consistent and humáne administration of justice, the Courts of this country are no longer influenced by the feudal policy which favored the eldest son to the exclusion of other claims; and are not restrained, as Lord Eldon was, from contradicting a decision of the English House of Lords, if founded upon a principle which has no existence in this country, and the decision be opposed to reason and justice, and to the opinions of enlightened jurists, in that country as well as in this. It was well urged in the argument by Mansfield and Fonblanque for the plaintiffs, in Perry <em>v. </em>Whitehead, that “ the ground that a grandfather is not bound to provide for his grandchild, as a father is for a child, and the former, therefore, is not under the same moral obligation, would sound extraordinary out of a Court of judicature, and certainly affords no reason. The statute of Elizabeth imposes the same obligations upon a grandfather and grandmother, as upon the parents; which is the sense of the legislature and of mankind 6 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>546. In Pennsylvania, the grandfather, as well as the father, is required by the Act of 13th June, 1836, section 28, to relieve and maintain his grandchildren, when their necessities require it. This statute is in accordance with the moral sense of mankind. Those who suppose that infant grandchildren do not, upon the death of their parents, take the place of the latter in the affections of their grandfather, are strangers to the most ordinary manifestations of the best feelings of the human heart. As the mementoes of the departed child, they have peculiar claims to his regard; and their unprotected helplessness, produced by the common bereavement, in most cases rivets his affections to them closer than they ever clung to their parent. If there is anything in the argument in favor of awarding interest on a legacy to a child, resting upon the presumption that a parent did not intend that his children should starve, the presumption holds, with equal strength, where the parent is dead, and <em>the </em>grandchildren are in the will substituted to the legacy previously given to the parent for life. If a testator, by benevolent manifestations, may put himself in <em>loco </em>parentis, so as to entitle a stranger to maintenance, much slighter circumstances will bring the case of a grandchild within that rule. Indeed, this may always be presumed, where, as in the case under consideration, the legacy is given to the child only for life, and upon its death the grandchildren a,re substituted, under the express direction in the will, to receive the legacy, the income of which had been previously given to their parent.</p>
