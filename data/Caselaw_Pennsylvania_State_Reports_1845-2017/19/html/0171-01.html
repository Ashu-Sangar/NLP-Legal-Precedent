    <p class="summary" id="b173-6" data-blocks='[["BL_173.7",173,[185,1075,1168,763]]]'>This suit was brought by James L. Graves against Cole, to recover the amount of a bill for boarding, made by his wife, while engaged in defending herself against a libel in divorce, filed by defendant against her, charging her with adultery, and while she was prosecuting a subsequent suit for divorce against him. Defendant and his wife resided at Tioga Village, a distance of seventeen miles from Wellsborough, the county seat. Defendant separated himself from his wife, and filed a libel in divorce against her, charging her with adultery. She left his house and went to live with her sister, who resided in the same village, where her husband afterwards provided for her board. His suit was tried, and verdict rendered in favor of the wife. A new trial was granted. No further proceedings were had on that application. The wife afterwards applied for a divorce, and a decree of divorce was made. It did not appear that any application, on the part of the wife, was made to the Court for an allowance for costs or expenses, and no decree against the husband, to that effect, was made.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b173-8" data-blocks='[["BL_173.9",173,[185,2062,1166,348]]]'>On part of plaintiff, John Graves testified, that James L. Graves was keeping public-house in Wellsborough, in September, 1845, and in February, 1846. Mrs. Cole, wife of defendant, boarded there during two Courts. She was there a week at each time; one week at September Term, and one week at February Term. Had a room by herself. Had four witnesses there. She was defending a suit for divorce against her. She directed her board bill to be charged to her husband. It was charged to him.</p>

Shortly after, she returned home, and Cole came up and wished me to give Graves notice that he had separated himself from his wife, and had provided a comfortable residence for her with her brother-in-law, and had applied for a bill of divorce, and would not pay for any expenses incurred by her at Graves’ or anywhere else. This the witness communicated to H. B. Graves, who appeared to have the management of the house; and shortly after he had a conversation with James L. Graves, the owner of the house, upon the subject. Told him how Cole had provided for his wife at Tioga Village. The house of her brother-in-law was a comfortable place for her.</p>

In answer to the second point, the Court charged the jury that if the husband files a libel for divorce against his wife, charging her with adultery, he would still be liable for her support, until decree, unless she elopes from him. If she eloped with the adulterer, and remained from him, he would not be liable. That the husband would not, necessarily, be liable for all her expenses in defending herself. The course of proceeding in chancery for the wife, when thus prosecuted, in order to obtain the means of defending herself, is, to put in her answer to the bill, on her oath or affirmation, denying the charge, and then make application to <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>Court, if need be, to make an order on tbe husband to furnish a sufficient sum to pay the expenses of making defence ; and such, we think, should be the mode of proceeding in this Court.</p>

As to his being liable to all necessary expenses in her prosecuting her libel for a divorce, that depends on the decrees of the Courts, who have power to decree costs.</p>
