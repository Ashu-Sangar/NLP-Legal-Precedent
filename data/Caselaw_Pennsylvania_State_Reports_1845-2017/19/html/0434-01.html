As <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>this is the only question which touches the right of Martin MeCanna, the lessee, the judgment as to him is affirmed.</p>

Be it so. This is an action founded upon tort, and the verdict may be for one defendant and against the other, according to the facts of the case. There is much good sense and substantial justice in the rule indicated in Dietrick <em>v. </em>Mateer, 10 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>153, and after ten years’ consideration and experience of its utility, reaffirmed in Steinmetz <em>v. </em>Logan, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20162" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="3 Watts 162">3 <em>Watts </em>162</a>. The object of the Act of Assembly is to try the rights of the parties to the land, and when it is considered that two concurrent verdicts and judgments are conclusive, it seems reasonable that a defendant who does not intend to contest the plaintiff’s right to the land, and who puts his defence upon the ground that he is not in possession of any part of it, should, <em>“ </em>at the entry of his plea, or at a period sufficiently early to warn the plaintiff of the nature of the defence to be made at the trial,” enter his disclaimer upon record. But on the authority of Mitchell <em>v. </em>Bratton, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%2070" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="5 Watts 70">5 <em>Watts </em>70</a>, and Zeigler <em>v. </em>Fisher, 3 <em>Barr </em>367, it seems that this is not necessary, and that a plaintiff, in order to recover in ejectment, must establish not only his own title, but also the possession of the defendant. There was error, therefore, in permitting a recovery against Henry Manson, without proof of his possession of any part of the land. For this reason the judgment, as to him, is reversed. Under the Act of 1836, giving the Supreme Court power to modify judgments, it has been held that the judgment, in a proper case, may be affirmed as to one defendant and reversed as to the other: Jameson <em>v. </em>Pomeroy, 9 <em>Barr </em>230.</p>
