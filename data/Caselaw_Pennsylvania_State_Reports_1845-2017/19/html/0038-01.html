It was contended that the purchaser bought at sheriff’s sale a fee simple title, as apparently existing in Barbara Evieh under the patent. That if the plaintiff was entitled in remainder in fee, she was postponed on account of the failure to record the deed, or give notice at the sheriff’s sale.</p>
