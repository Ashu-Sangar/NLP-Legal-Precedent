In 1824, a tract with an equivalent description was sold by the same officer for subsequent taxes, and bought by George F. A. Hautto. The original owner had until 1825 to redeem against the first sale, and until 1826 to redeem against the second; but he did nothing in the matter until 1830, when he redeemed against the first sale.</p>

We assume also, as it was assumed in the argument, that either sale would have been effective had it not been for the other; and that the plaintiffs have no title, unless they obtained one by the operation of the second sale. What then have we ? In 1824, the county, by her taxing power, and through her taxing officers, had acquired a complete title to this land, subject only to the redemption right, having then one year to run. Then by an improper exercise of the same functions by the same officers, she sold the land again, and Hautto bought it. In other words, the county, in 1820, had an inchoate title to this land, and one year before it became absolute she sold it to Hautto, by a power which she had then no right to exercise. The question is at once suggested, what effect had the second sale upon the rights of the original owner? We answer, none at all. What right had he? Simply the right of redemption until 1825, and that could not be affected by any act of the county officers. But that right was not exercised in time. What then ? The title under the first sale, in whomsoever it then existed, became absolute in 1825. Then the right of redemption was gone, and to allow it afterwards was matter merely of grace and not of right. It is answered, however, that it was allowed in 1830. True; but an allowance by grace could not affect any valid title previously acquired from the county.

Thus, when a man sells land which he does not own, and afterwards acquires the title; or when he acts as agent in selling his own land as the property of another; or when he sees his own land offered for sale as the property of another, and encourages the sale of it, he shall never be allowed to use his own title to the injury <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>of the person whom he has thus misled: <em>Rawle on Covenants </em>341-5; 2 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>507; 10 <em>State Rep. </em>531, and eases there cited.</p>

On these principles it would seem plain that the sale of 1824 was effectual in vesting in Hautto the title which the county acquired by the sale of 1820, and that title became perfect and absolute in him in 1825, on the failure of the original owner to redeem according to law.</p>

True, this irregularity did exist, but, though to divest the original owner it is essential to follow the course prescribed by the Act of Assembly; yet, so far as it affects the title of the county, that course has been treated as directory rather than essential: Steiner <em>v. </em>Coxe, 4 <em>State Rep. </em>25; Huston <em>v. </em>Foster, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20478" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Watts 478">1 <em>Watts </em>478</a>. The same strictness is not required when the county is parting with its own titlé, as when it is divesting that of another.

The question always arises, in relation to whom is it void? Void, the second sale certainly was, as to the title which the original owner then had, and it never did affect that title. But when he got a title in 1830 by the grace of the commissioners, that was a new title, and depends for its validity on the title which the county then had, and is good for nothing, if the county then had no title. As a person having no interest has no right to object to the transaction as void, so the defendants cannot object to the second sale except through the county,, and the rights which they have derived from the county.
