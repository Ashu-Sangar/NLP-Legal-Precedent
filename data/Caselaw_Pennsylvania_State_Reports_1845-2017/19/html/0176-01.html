Though not a party to the record, he should have been excluded', whether his assignment were real or fictitious ; for whilst one of tM parties to a contract in litigation is denied the privilege of testifying, the policy of the law is to close the mouth of the other. The rule is as applicable to evidence offered under the plea of set off as to that which a plaintiff may offer in support of his action.: Muirhead <em>v. </em>Kirkpatrick, above cited. It cannot be denied that there are several recent cases which in principle are irreconcilable with Post <em>v. </em>Avery and its cognates. See Carter <em>v. </em>Trueman, 7 <em>Barr </em>325; Taylor <em>v. </em>Gill, 10 <em>Barr </em>428; and Dutten <em>v. </em>Tilden, <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>13 <em>State Reports. </em>But these cases were intended to restrain the rule from undue extension,- rather than to repeal it. It rests on sound reason and abundant authority, and this is a fit case for its application.</p>
