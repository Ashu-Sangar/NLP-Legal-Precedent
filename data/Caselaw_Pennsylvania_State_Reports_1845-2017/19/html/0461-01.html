He had four sons, James, Matthew, John, and Andrew, and one daughter," Narcissa, married to Nathaniel Moore. James died in 1830, Matthew died in 1832, and John, the son, died some- time previous. John Small gave to his son James, in his lifetime, the possession of 100 acres of his tract, on the north end of it. He also gave to <em>Matthew </em>privilege to build a house on the 100 acres next to the one occupied by James, and to farm it in common with himself, which he did till his death. In 1824, Matthew commenced the building of a hewed log-house, dug in search of water, and finding none, the building was abandoned, after being raised to the square, and before it was roofed. The logs were removed, and used in building a barn on a piece of land of 100 acres, which he purchased from Patrick Thompson, adjoining his father’s tract on the east, on which he also built a 'house, and resided till his death, in 1832. After the death of James, which took place in 1830, his father sold the 100 acres, which had been occupied by him, to Nathaniel Moore. On the 10th day of November, 1835, the grandfather made his will, and devised the 100 acres next adjoining it on the south to Narcissa Moore, his daughter. No division of the tract had been made by John Small among his sons. No lines were ever run in his lifetime separating one portion of the 400 acres from another, except the north 100 acres, when it was sold to Moore after the death of James. But James had been permitted to occupy what was supposed to be 100 acres next adjoining it on the south, which is the land John Small afterwards devised to his daughter, and is the same now in controversy. It was alleged on the part of the plaintiff, that John Small continued to use the 100 acres, with the residue of the tract, by occasionally farming it, cutting and hauling away saw logs, barn logs, cord wood for his distillery, and firewood, rails, &amp;c., during the occupancy of his son Matthew, the same as before and after. This was denied on the part of defendants.— John Small died in March, 1837.</p>

A house was built in 1824 on the land in dispute; attempts were made to dig a well, estimated altogether at $200. A second cabin was erected on the land, and a quantity of land cleared, amounting to upwards of five acres. A tenant, Samuel Stanton, resided there from the spring of 1829 to the fall of 1838. On the 19th of November, 1835, John Small made his will, devising this land to the plaintiff, and shortly afterwards died.

The statute for prevention of frauds and perjuries was one of those enactments Though enacted before the charter to William Penn, this statute has been held not to extend to Pennsylvania. But its most material provisions were supplied to us by our Act of 21st March, 1772. It is remarkable how completely, both in England and Pennsylvania', the public mind has acquiesced in these enactments. History tells of no popular movement in either of these representative governments, for the repeal or material modification of the statute of frauds and perjuries. Chancellors and judges have <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>often manifested great uneasiness under its operation, and have expounded and refined uniil the rule has ceased to be looked for in the statute itself, but must be tracked through volumes of jarring and contradictory decisions.

The popular acquiescence of which I have spoken may be due, in some measure, to' this necessary and reasonable construction. But, that the statute should have effect except where its operation would defeat its objects, is a corollary from this principle of construction, and agreeable to reason, though lost sight of in the decision of many cases. Hard cases make bad precedents, is a maxim that has been strikingly illustrated by the course of decision under this statute. Judges have been borne away, by sympathy for parties, from the letter of the law, and in their benevolent efforts to accommodate it to the changeful circumstances of cases, copious fountains of litigation have become unsealed. Nobody has lamented this judicial amiability more than the judges themselves. For the last twenty years there has scarcely been a judge of any considerable reputation, either in England or the United States, who has not in some manner put on reeord his regrets, the results of large experience, that the statute had been so widely departed from, and his conviction, that more evils have resulted from such departures than they have remedied.</p>

The Legislature seem to have considered all parol contracts as within the statute of frauds and perjuries, and that, though partly executed, they ought to be rescinded, if it can be done without injustice to the parties; but if they have been so far executed as to render it unjust to rescind them, then the Courts shall hold them to be without the statute, and go on and execute them fully. In passing upon the question of injustice, reference is to be had to the fact that the 4th section of the British statute, which forbids <a id="p467" href="#p467" data-label="467" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*467</a>any action on a parol agreement, unless there he a note of it in writing, signed by the party to he charged, is wholly omitted in our statute.

The judge blots himself out and surrenders his functions to the jury, who, more affected by the supposed hardship of the case than by the policy of the statute, blot out, in their turn, that venerable and valuable rule of property.</p>
    <p id="b470-6" data-blocks='[["BL_470.6",470,[370,930,1156,514]]]'>But how is this to be prevented ? In no otherwise than by the action of the judge as a chancellor, which he truly is. I know that here are some of the most difficult duties of the judicial office. To submit what ought to be submitted, yet in such manner as not to give the jury unrestrained license over the equities of the cause, requires care and skill on the bench. And Courts have been embarrassed in this duty by the dicta in our books that, where there is any proof of circumstances to take a case out of the statute, the value of it is to be determined by the jury. “Any proof,” a “spark of evidence,” and similar expressions have been used to define the powers of juries in this regard. Such dicta cannot be implicitly followed if the law of the land is to be administered.</p>
    <p id="b470-7" data-blocks='[["BL_470.7",470,[368,1443,1156,514]]]'>The judge is bound to view and weigh facts for himself. If the facts relied on to make out a case for specific relief are insufficient, why admit evidence of them ? Or if admitted, why suffer them to go to the jury ? If the material facts are in conflict, and the credibility of witnesses is involved, the case must go to the jury, but then they should have such express directions in plain, specific, and positive terms suited to any proper view that they may take of the testimony, as will leave them nothing to pass upon but the credibility of witnesses and the ascertainment of facts. And through the power to grant new trials, the judge should superintend, with a cautious eye, the action of the jury in this their only proper sphere.</p>

Rep. </em>362</a>. The case before us belongs to this family. Now let it be observed, that the Legislature of Pennsylvania have made no provision, either in the Act of 1818, <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>or that of 1834, or any other Act of Assembly, for the conveyance of title in pursuance of a <em>parol gift of land. </em>Yet in most of the cases it has been the gift of the decedent that was set up to take away the inheritance of the other heirs. In this case it is a parol gift of a deceased father set up to defeat his written devise. Such a gift could not be admitted to probate under any chancery jurisdiction that has been conferred on either our Common Pleas or Orphans’ Courts.</p>
    <p id="b471-6" data-blocks='[["BL_471.6",471,[167,755,1162,679]]]'>How would a chancellor treat evidence of a parol gift ? He would cast it out as rubbish. There is no such thing as the execution of a gift of lands under the statute of frauds, even between father and son. Grift is indeed a common law mode of assurance, but it is a contract <em>executed. </em>Contracts, to be executed by the extraordinary powers of a chancellor, in spite of the statute of frauds, must be executory, and must be founded in a valuable consideration. It is true, the consideration may be in a prejudice to the vendee, as well as in a benefit to the vendor. And if it be said that a son, who goes upon land under a promise of a conveyance from his father, and expends his labor and money in making valuable improvements which cannot be reasonably compensated, is entitled to a decree of conveyance,, it is because he is a purchaser for a valuable consideration. It is inaccurate language to call such a contract a gift, and confusion of terms is very apt to breed confusion of ideas.</p>
    <p id="b471-7" data-blocks='[["BL_471.7",471,[165,1440,1164,983]]]'>In such cases the son, like any other purchaser, must prove the contract; that the land was clearly designated; that open, notorious, and exclusive possession was taken and maintained under and in pursuance of 'the contract; and that the improvements which constitute the consideration were made on the faith of the promised conveyance: Woods <em>v. </em>Farmere, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%20204" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="10 Watts 204">10 <em>Watts </em>204</a>; Frye <em>v. </em>Shepler, 7 <em>Barr </em>91; Wack <em>v. </em>Sorber, <a href="/whart/2/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 Whart. 387" data-case-ids="1830460" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0387-01">2 <em>Wharton </em>387</a>. If the contract were ever made it must have had a time and place and terms, and it would be reasonable to expect a witness to speak of these, but declarations and confessions of the father have been so frequently received in evidence as proof of a contract, it is impossible to say they are unfit to go to the jury, but they should go, characterized by the language of Justice Rogers, in Robertson <em>v. </em>Robertson, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%2042" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="9 Watts 42">9 <em>Watts </em>42</a>, as the most unsatisfactory species of evidence, on account of the facility with which they may be fabricated, the impossibility of contradicting them, and the mistakes and failures of recollection. Parental declarations are often made with reference to experimental arrangements or testamentary intentions for the benefit of a son, which are sadly misapplied when brought into Court and treated as evidential of a contract of sale. The posthumous recollections of a neighborhood, as to the words of a testator, should weigh but little when set against his written will.</p>

      <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>In the case in hand, the plaintiffs claimed under a devise from John Small, admitted to have been the owner, in his lifetime, of the land in dispute. They stand in Court, therefore, clothed with the legal title. The defendants are children of Matthew Small, deceased, who was one of four sons of John Small, and they claim to hold the land under what is sometimes called, in the paper-book, a parol gift, and sometimes, a parol gift <em>or </em>contract between their father and grandfather. The statute of frauds and perjuries is in their way. But they claim, on the evidence, to be within the equities of the statute, and as equity considers that as done which ought to be done, the defence is, that the legal title, apparently in the plaintiffs, is really in them. The defence amounts to a bill in equity for a conveyance of that title to them, in execution of the parol contract. This is the posture of the parties, and in this position the burthen of proof is on the defendants. All the <em>primá facie </em>presumptions are in favor of the plaintiffs. Have the defendants overcome them by such proof as we have seen can only avail to set aside the statute ?</p>
    <p id="b472-6" data-blocks='[["BL_472.6",472,[368,1170,1156,331]]]'>In the first place, the contract is sought to be made out by the declarations of the grandfather, but these are contradicted by the declarations of the father. The evidence represents the old man as saying that he had given the land to Matthew, and that it was his, and it represents Matthew as saying, that it had not been given to him, and that it was his father’s land. However perfectly witnesses may have understood the contract, the parties do not seem to have understood it alike.</p>
    <p id="b472-7" data-blocks='[["BL_472.7",472,[368,1511,1159,257]]]'>In the next place, assuming a contract, there was no sufficient designation of the land. A line was pointed out on the north, between Matthew and James, but no other line was designated by the old man, to mark off from his remaining land the 100 acres he intended for Matthew. The line claimed by Matthew on the south embraced some of the improved land of his father.</p>
    <p id="b472-8" data-blocks='[["BL_472.8",472,[368,1767,1157,384]]]'>In the third place, the evidence of possession is wholly defective. That Matthew took possession of the land in pursuance of the contract, can scarcely be said to be proved, whilst it is proved that he never had the exclusive possession. There were the old hill fields on the disputed tract, spoken of by Andrew, as worked sometimes by Matthew and sometimes by the old man; and there were the saw logs, barn logs, firewood, and rails, taken from the land by the old man, to show that his possession had never been fully surrendered.</p>
    <p id="b472-9" data-blocks='[["BL_472.9",472,[370,2147,1153,220]]]'>Ñor, finally, were the improvements such as to raise a,n equity. The log house which Matthew commenced he removed to the Thompsons’ tract, where he resided, and converted it into a barn. The small piece of land he cleared, if not long since paid for in the use of the improved fields, admits of compensation.</p>
    <p id="b472-10" data-blocks='[["BL_472.10",472,[413,2364,1110,48]],["BL_473.1",473,[174,407,1157,508]]]'>Without discussing the evidence in full, we think it failed en<a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>tirely to make out these essential points. The consequence is, the defence fails. A chancellor would not decree a conveyance on such proofs. If the defendants were seeking specific execution in the Common Pleas or the Orphans’ Court, they could not have it, for the “ contract was not so far in part executed as to render it unjust to rescind the same.” Nor is there anything in the charge of the learned judge to indicate his satisfaction with the evidence. The whole case was turned over to the jury, and they were substituted for the chancellor, to pass on the equities of the defendants, and of course they were dealt with loosely. In all this the principles I have stated were contravened, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>
