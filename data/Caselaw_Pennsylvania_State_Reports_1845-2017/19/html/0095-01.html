The testator died in 1815; and arrearages of interest on the ¿6500 accumulated till about 1838, when counsel was employed to collect the same. Further arrearages accumulated, and in 1845, Mr. Penrose wTas employed as counsel to collect them.

Mr. Penrose removed, and the collection devolved mainly upon Mr. Frazer, who became recognised as her counsel by Mrs. Mohler, through her son and her attorney in fact, Christian Bowman. A dispute arose with the defendant about the fees. The widow died in 1850, and this suit was brought after her death.

Where such a payment by one attorney to another, for services rendered to a common client, has been too large, but was made honestly, and in the belief that it was right, the client may not recover any part of it from him who paid it, but must seek it from him who has it.
