      <em>“ </em>The rules of navigation are very similar in form and spirit to the law of the road. There is no law requiring that people shall travel on any particular part of a road, and the usage is for each man to take that part of it which is best beaten, because he can travel it with the most ease. But he must regard the convenience and safety of others, and therefore, to avoid collision, or danger of collision, he must turn <em>to the right. </em>This rule, however, is not of absolute obligation, for it is not expected or demanded that a heavily laden vehicle shall leave the beaten road for one that is light, if sufficient room be left on either side, and no vehicle is éxpected to turn out for a footman or a horseman. So a vehicle crossing from one side of the road to the other is bound to see that it does not put itself in the way of another that is going along the road: <a href="/watts/1/0360-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Watts 360" data-case-ids="1838061" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0360-01">1 <em>Watts </em>360</a>; 2 <em>Qhip. </em>136; <a href="/mass/18/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Pick. 345" data-case-ids="2070860" data-case-paths="/mass/18/0352-01">1 <em>Pick. </em>345</a>; 1 <em>Stark. </em>423; 2 JEsp, 533; 5 <em>Id. </em>273.</p>

Of a similar character are the rules of navigation. Thus, there is no rule requiring a vessel to occupy any particular part of the sea, or of a river. All rules of law are relative in their character, being intended to regulate conflicting claims. These, claims arise only where vessels are in the vicinity of each other. In daylight this vicinity is at once discovered, and then the duty arises for each to regard the right of the other. At night the vicinity of another vessel is not so easily discovered, but the mere fact that two vessels are in the vicinity of each other changes the duties of both; and it is easily seen that in a crowded thorough<a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>fare like our rivers and mouths of our ocean harbors, it is the duty of every vessel to give constant notice of her vicinity, by carrying a light in a dark night.</p>

To do this, each must act according to rule, <em>and must presume that the other will do likewise. </em>Thus, if both vessels have the wind free, or abeam, they must both keep to the right. If that be their course they must keep it, if not they must port their helm. Each must calculate on this course being taken by the other. If one vessel is close hauled and the other free, the latter must give way and bear off, and the former <em>must </em>keep her course. The reason is plain — the vessel that is free is under command. So, if two vessels are meeting, one on the larboard and the other on the starboard tack, and each has the wind equal, she on the larboard tack must give way, and the other <em>must </em>hold her course.</p>

Convenience fixes the usage. In a full river, descending boats keep the middle of the river, because that is favorable to their progress; ascending boats seek the slow water along the shores, because that is favorable to their progress. Eor the same reason, ascending boats cross at the bends of rivers, to shorten the distance, and keep out of the strong currents which set in against the outer side of a bend. Thus boats do not keep the right or the left of the river in their course, and their usage is founded on good sense and convenience, and is sanctioned by law. But, as in the law of the road, when they approach each other, then their duties change. They must avoid a collision. Now, the question of mere convenience is set aside, and they must follow the rules which the reason of safety has dictated.</p>

      <em>“ </em>Steam vessels are of modern origin, but it is not at all difficult to apply the rules of common law to their navigation. The life of the law is in its reason, and the reason of the rules as to sailing vessels is applied at once to steam vessels, when we consider that they are as manageable as a sailing vessel with the wind free, and more so. Therefore, a steam vessel meeting a steam vessel, both are equal, and both must port their helm. A steam vessel must port her helm when meeting a sailing vessel, or any less manageable craft. There are some plain exceptions to this; thus, when a steam vessel is coming up, or going down, close to the right-hand shore, she is not to port helm, for she would run ashore, but the other must give way. So, also, where a steam vessel is going down a narrow channel where it would be dangerous for two to pass, she cannot safely change her course, and she cannot back out, therefore the vessel coming up must wait on her, or back out.</p>

You know, by the experience of this case, how difficult it is to calculate distances when both parties are on the water, and the stand point of both is moving. It is, therefore, considered a false move for one vessel to pass under the bows of another. Thus, when a sailing vessel, with the wind free, meets another close hauled, she should get out of her wTay by passing under her stern, whether this takes her to larboard or starboard. Where the safety of one vessel requires the adoption of preventive and precautionary measures on the- part of another, and this be not done, and damage ensues, he who was guilty of the omission must bear the loss.</p>

So, when two vessels are approaching each other, both having the wind free, and consequently the power of readily controlling their movements, <em>the vessel on the larboard tack must give </em>way, and <em>each pass to the right. </em>The same rule governs vessels sailing on the wind, and approaching each other, when it is doubtful which is to windward.

They are therefore required to do whatever sailing vessels going free, or with a fair wind, would be required to do under similar circumstances. There is this difference, however, between steamers and sailing vessels, that the forrqer, having greater control over their movements than the latter, even with a fair wind, are held to a stricter rule of responsibility. In the case of Lowrey <em>v. </em>The Steamboat Portland, in the United States District Court for Massachusetts, in January, 1839, it was <em>certified by experienced navi</em>gators., and <em>adjudged by the Court </em>as the rule on the subject, that “ when two vessels approach each other, both having a free or fair wind, <em>each vessel passes to the right; </em>and that a steamer was considered as always sailing with a fair wind, and is bound to do whatever a sailing vessel going free, or with a fair wind, would be required to do under similar circumstances: 3 <em>Kent’s Com. </em>231, n., &amp;c. Nearly two years afterwards, on 30th Oct. 1840, the experienced navigators of Trinity House, a corporation of pilots which has existed under different charters ever since the reign of Henry YHL, “recognised” the existence of the same rules of navigation. So far from professing to establish for the first time even the application of the old rule to steamers, they expressly declare that, “ on communication with the Lords Commissioners of the <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>Admiralty, the elder brethren find <em>it has been already adopted </em>in respect to steam vessels in her majesty’s service.” These rules of navigation have been frequently revised in admiralty cases in the District Court. And in 1850, they were strongly enforced by the Supreme Court of the United States: <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Howard%20581" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="10 Howard 581">10 <em>Howard </em>581</a>.

From the paper-book, it would seem, that the defendants below insisted that “ when the Caroline was discovered, she was ascending the Ohio shore, and that as the Consignee approached, the course of the Caroline was suddenly changed across the river, so as to pass improperly under the bows of the Consignee.” In reference to this ground of defence the Judge instructed the jury, that “if the Caroline made the movement which the defendants’ witnesses think <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>she did, it was, I think, a false move, and she cannot recover; for her false move may have led to a false move of the Consignee.” This question of fact was submitted to the jury, and they have found it against the plaintiffs in error*. The error, if there be one, lies with them, and their decision is not the subject of revision on a writ of error. The instructions given were perfectly correct.</p>
