When called by the plaintiffs, the defendants, to sustain their objection, swore him on his <em>voir dire, </em>and the fact which they extracted from him would have rendered him incompetent without a further explanation. But the party who called him took up the examination, and in reply to <em>their </em>inquiries he stated what showed that he had no interest. All he said must be taken together. The points decided in Thomas <em>v. </em>Brady (10 <em>Barr </em>167), and in Griffith <em>v. </em>Reford (<a href="/rawle/1/0196-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Rawle 196" data-case-ids="1819361" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0196-01">1 <em>Rawle </em>196</a>), bear no resemblance to this, or at any rate very little.</p>

This was objected to on the ground that the charges were against the vessel, and Hill was not proved to be a partner. It was withdrawn; evidence was given that Hill was one of the owners, and then the account was offered anew, when a general objection was made without specifying the ground. We are now asked to reverse the judgment, because the affidavit states it to be “an accurate transcript from the books of the firm,” and not, as the rule requires, “ a copy taken from the plaintiffs’ books of original entry.” ■ This would have been fatal to the judgment if the objection had been rested on that specific point at the trial. But where a party gives his reason for opposing the admission of evidence, and has it put on the record, he cannot urge a different reason here ; and where the same evidence is offered twice, and twice objected to, it must be presumed that both objections are upon the same ground unless the contrary appears. General objections may cause the reversal of a judgment for errors which the Court below did not co'mmit, and are therefore to be discouraged.
