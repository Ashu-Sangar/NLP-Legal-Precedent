This would be presenting the former doctrine of recovery in a new aspect. One verdict and judgment are not conclusive even in the very same interest, and between the same parties; whereas this would make one verdict and judgment, as to one interest and one set of parties, conclusive as to all similar interests and as to other parties, even though not heard.</p>

I trust that this doctrine shall never be held to mean that the last decision of a point is to be taken as the law of all future cases, right or wrong. Then indeed will the isolated blunders of this Court be of far more force than an Act of Assembly, or a clause of the constitution; for they may invade the inviolability of contracts. This is certainly a new phase of the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>that is most suicidal in its result. It is setting aside the old doctrine and establishing a new one. It is a declaration that all Courts of the last resort must have been in error every time they have acknowledged and set aside former errors, which has not been an unfrequent event. Nay, more; it is claiming for this Court an infallibility that can have no result but the perpetuation of the most incompatible errors.</p>

It is well explained in <em>Lieber's Pol. Herm. </em>209. “ In a free country, where a knowledge of the citizens’ rights is all important, a precedent in law, if correctly and clearly stated — this is an essential requisite — -and if applied with discernment and with the final object of all law before our eyes, ought to have its full weight. If there has been a series of uniform decisions on the same point, they ought to have the force of law, because in this case they have become conclusive evidence of the law.” And the same writer has well estimated the value of a mere decision when he says, 1 <em>Pol. Ethics, </em>265, “there is hardly such a thing as judge-made law, but only judge-spoken law. The doctrine pronounced to-day from a bench may, indeed, not be found in any law book ; but the judge has ascertained and declared the sense of the community as already evinced in its usages and habits of business. If he <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>has not expressed it correctly, society will show its sovereign power; his decision will be reversed to-morrow, or corrected by statute.”</p>
    <p id="b96-6" data-blocks='[["BL_96.6",96,[378,524,1165,761]]]'>The true doctrine on this subject was declared and ’acted upon by this Court in Hawk <em>v. </em>Geddis, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20286" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="1 Watts 286">1 <em>Watts </em>286</a>, and Cowden’s Appeal, 1 <em>State Rep. </em>279, and is thus laid down by Chancellor Kent <em>(Comm. Lect. </em>21): “ I wish not to be understood to press too strongly the doctrine of <em>stare decisis, </em>when I recollect that there are a thousand cases to be pointed out in the English and American books of reports, which have been overruled, doubted, or limited in their application. It is probable that the records of many of the Courts in this country are replete with hasty and crude decisions ; and such cases ought to be examined without fear, and revised without reluctance, rather than have the character of our law impaired, and the beauty and harmony of the system destroyed by the perpetuity of error. Even a series of decisions are not always conclusive evidence of what is <em>law; </em>and the revision of a decision very often resolves itself into a mere question of expediency, depending upon the consideration of the importance of certainty in the rule, and the extent of property to be effected by a change of it.”</p>

How many are the wills similarly worded which have never been heard of in Court, because their construction has been considered as settled by former decisions, it is impossible to tell. Certainly the law must be the same for all. We dare not say that the principle of this case shall be limited to this will, for that would be making the rights of parties depend on the will of the judge, and not on the law of the land. We cannot do justice in this case without rejecting the decision in Weidman <em>v. </em>Maish, and reversing this judgment.</p>
