    <p id="b496-12" data-blocks='[["BL_496.18",496,[392,1563,1162,431]]]'>The Act of Assembly makes it the duty of the Court to direct an issue, on the request in writing of any person interested, for the trial of any <em>fact in dispute. </em>The issue here was demanded to try whether the judgment of Hellen &amp; West was paid off. Now this could not fairly be considered a fact in dispute between the parties. The evidence attached to the auditor’s report shows that the defendant did not assert before him that the judgment was paid off, but only that he was entitled to a credit upon it for a book account, not against the firm but against one of the partners, and that was rebutted by a counter claim just as well supported.</p>
