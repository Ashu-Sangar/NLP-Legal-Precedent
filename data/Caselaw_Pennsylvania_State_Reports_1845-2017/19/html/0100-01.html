On the part of the defendants in error, who were plaintiffs below, it is contended that the agreement of 1787 was not intended to establish <em>permanent </em>relations between the parties, and that there is nothing in it to deprive them of the remedies which are incidental to tenancies in common.

The ore-banks and mine-hills of which partition is sought in this action, were part of the Cornwall Furnace estate, and before the death of Peter Grubb, the ancestor of Burd and Henry Bates Grubb, he, his brother Curtis Grubb, and Robert Coleman for Cornwall Furnace, Robert Coleman for Elizabeth Furnace, and Peter Grubb for Mount Hope Furnace, held the said ore-banks and mine-hills, to supply the same respectively with iron ore, as they held the woodland belonging to the said furnaces respectively for the supply of charcoal for the manufacture of iron; and for the purpose of such supply of iron ore and charcoal, the said ore-banks and mine-hills, and said woodlands respectively, had been continually held, with, and as appurtenances to, and parcel of the said furnaces respectively, with the full knowledge and consent of the owners. Two former efforts had been made to part these estates into severalty. One by agreement of 8th December, 1785, of the parties then in interest, the other by agreement of 6th May, 1786; and in both of these agreements the mine-hills, like the rest of the estate, were to be divided into three equal <em>parts </em>— two <em>equal third parts thereof, considering quantity and quality, </em>to be assigned and allotted to Curtis Grubb and Robert Coleman, according to their several shares, and <em>the other one-third equal part thereof </em>to be assigned and allotted to the said Peter Grubb, to be by them held respectively in severalty. This stipulation in these prior agreements is worthy of observation, as manifesting the intention and desire of the parties that the mine-hills should continue to be used and en <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>joyed as appurtenant to each of the furnaces and forges held in common.</p>

Partition of the mine-hills was indeed to be had, but it was to. be partition into <em>11 three equal parts, considering quantity and quality,” </em>a result which, had it proved attainable, would have been mutually beneficial, for it would have given to each owner in severalty a competent share of ore for the use of the residue of his estate. But after the fullest investigation by men qualified for the duty, such partition was found impossible; and this discovery led to the agreement of 30th August, 1787, which is the document now to be construed.</p>
    <p id="b106-7" data-blocks='[["BL_106.7",106,[343,1007,1157,555]]]'>The parties recite that the former agreement cannot be carried into execution without the greatest injustice to some of the parties, and that the same had been so represented by the persons appointed in the said agreement to make partition. “ Therefore, in order to remove all difficulties,” and to assign and allot the premises according to the real interests and convenience of the several parties, this agreement was made, substantially reaffirming that of 6th May, 1786, except as to the mine-hills, which, instead of being divided, were to remain “together and undivided, as a tenancy in common,” the parties not to interfere with or interrupt each other at any mine-hole by them opened and occupied for the purpose of raising iron ore. Thus we see that the parties made this agreement as the only practicable mode of effecting partition of the whole estate.</p>

They were, <em>first </em>and chiefly, the peculiarities in the formation of these hills. They are described as enveloped in walls of trap-rock, indicating at the surface, by their angles of position, that they came together; but whether they did not expand instead of meet beneath the surface, was uncertain. From these walls, irregular sheets or veins of trap-rock were found extending into the iron ore, forming irregular masses of both ore and rock, and, in many instances, cutting off the ore entirely, so as to render its continuance in a particular direction extremely uncertain. Beside, the ore in the different hills is of different qualities or kinds, and various kinds of ore are found in the same hill, a mixture of which is necessary to make good iron. The ore becomes exhausted at particular places where it is so mingled with sulphur and copper as not to be fit for use.</p>
    <p id="b106-9" data-blocks='[["BL_106.9",106,[343,2244,1154,175]],["BL_107.1",107,[162,410,1171,2021]],["BL_108.1",108,[367,406,1162,1029]]]'>Such was the structure of these hills; and is it strange that they Avere regarded as indivisible into “ three equal parts, considering quantity and quality ?” Geology and mineralogy were unKnown as sciences at that day; but even in their present develop<a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>ment, they would be incompetent to guide an inquest to such a partition of these shapeless and unstratified masses of rock and ore. This difficulty, then, was inherent in the subject-matter, and however it might be dealt with now, was regarded as insuperable in 1787. Unless violence be done to the intention of the parties, their agreement must be so construed as to remove this difficulty. That is, the physical peculiarities of these hills must not be permitted to prevent partition of the rest of the estate, and when the rest of the estate shall be divided, each part must have participation in the varied treasures of the hills. 2d. The state of the law of partition in Pennsylvania constituted another of the “ difficulties” of the parties. At common law there was no writ of partition between tenants in common. It was given by the statute of 31 Henry VIII., which was extended to Pennsylvania. In 1772 an Act of Assembly empowered the Courts of this state to issue writs of partition, and this was all the legislation in force here at the time this agreement was made. By an Act of 1799, and various subsequent Acts of Assembly, the powers of the Courts are enlarged, and proceedings in partition fully regulated; and if, upon inquisition, the estate be found incapable of division without prejudice to or spoiling the whole, it is appraised and valued; if divided at all, the parts are appraised, tenants in common are called in to elect to take or refuse at the appraised value, unequal parts are equalized by owrelty, and if all the tenants in common refuse to take, the estate is sold and the price divided. Under these Acts of Assembly partition or a sale could now be compelled of an estate situated as this was in 1787; but at that time there was no provision in force for valuation, election, owelty, or sale. The parties contracted with a view to the law as it then stood. We had no Court of Chancery to administer the statute of Henry VIII., and the statute provided only for equal partition among tenants in common, as estates of coparceners were divisible at common law. Such a division the parties believed to be impossible, and they accordingly undertook to do that for themselves which the law was incapable of doing for them. Had the law authorized a valuation of purparts, and enabled the Court to order a sale, they would not, peradventure, have come into the agreement to divide part of their estate, and hold the rest in common, for some might have preferred a sale. 3d. Another difficulty sought to be avoided arose out of the reservation of an incorporeal hereditament in the deed of 9th May, 1786, Peter Grubb and wife to Robert Coleman, for an undivided sixth of Cornwall Furnace, and an undivided third of Hopewell Forges and appurtenances. This reservation was in these words : “ Saving and excepting unto the said Peter Grubb, Jr., his heirs and assigns for ever, the right, liberty, and privilege, at all times thereafter, of entering upon the premises, and of digging, raising, and hauling away a sufficient quan<a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>tity of iron ore for the supply of any one furnace, at the election of Peter Grubb, Jr., his heirs and assigns, at all times thereafter.” This was a right reserved of entering upon 9669 acres of land, and taking ore for the supply of any one furnace. What would have become of this easement on partition among the tenants in common of the estate out of which it was reserved ? Would Peter Grubb have been limited to the one-sixth part that might have been set out in severalty to his grantee, Robert Coleman ? This would have shorn the incorporeal hereditament of five-sixths of its value, without the consent of the owner of it. Would Peter Grubb have been permitted to enter and take ore from any part of the premises, as before partition ? This would have worked a prejudice and surcharge to the other tenants, for, unquestionably, the grant to Coleman, and the reservation to Peter Grubb, constituted but one <em>“ </em>stock,” as in Lord Mount-Joy’s case; and together they might not take more than one-sixth. See that case in <em>Thomas’ Co. Litt. </em>vol. 1, p. 536. Had the parties contemplated a <em>sale </em>of the estate, or the taking of it by one tenant in common at a valuation, this easement would have followed the estate, like an encumbrance ; but they had no thought of separating any one of themselves from the mine-hills, by sale or valuation. They looked only to a partition of those hills among themselves, in equal parts, “ considering quantity and quality,” and in the way of such a measure stood this easement, as a formidable difficulty.</p>
    <p id="b108-6" data-blocks='[["BL_108.6",108,[369,1436,1161,761]]]'>Such were the “ <em>difficulties’’ </em>which the parties, on a full investigation, saw in the way of such partition as was contemplated in the agreements of 1785 and 1786. They made the agreement of 1787 to avoid these difficulties. And as the difficulties all pertained to the mine-hills, they agreed to divide the rest of the estate and not to divide these: “ Provided always, and it is hereby agreed that the ore-banks belonging to Cornwall Furnace, shall remain together and undivided as a tenancy in common; the said Curtis Grubb being entitled to three sixth parts, the said Robert Coleman being entitled to one sixth part thereof, and the said minor children being entitled to the remaining two sixth parts thereof; and that, for this purpose, an accurate survey shall be made of the said ore-banks and hills, if not already done, and it is hereby declared to be the true intent and meaning hereof, that neither of the said parties, their agents or workmen, shall interfere with or interrupt either of the other parties at the mine-hole by them opened and occupied for the purpose of raising iron ore.” Such were their words.</p>

    <p id="b109-6" data-blocks='[["BL_109.6",109,[178,490,1168,1756]]]'>We have seen what the difficulties in the way of parting this estate into severalty were, and that they were inherent and enduring. So long as the ore should last the estate would be incapable of equal partition; and yet so long as these furnaces and forges should continue to manufacture iron, that ore would be wanted. They used words to obviate the difficulty. The remedy was commensurate with the evil. Experience had proved it possible for these tenants in common to supply the wants of their respective establishments by occupying, each his mine-hole, and the fullest investigation had demonstrated that this was the nearest to a partition in severalty to which these hills could be brought, without “ the greatest injustice to some of the parties.” Just in that condition, therefore, shall the mine-hills be left; <em>“remain” </em>is the word. How long, it is asked ? I answer, as long as the “ difficulties” remain. As long as the ore endures and continues to be wrought in these furnaces and forges. “Remain together, undivided,” not for a day, or month, or year, so that at any of these intervals either party should be at liberty to sue out partition, and bring on the difficulties again; but these words meant that partition should not be sought whilst the difficulties, the convenience, and the interests of the parties as ironmasters continued as they were. We see in these words, when taken in connection with the history of the case, a clear intention to exempt the mine-hills from partition, and continue the' participation of the parlies in the manner experience had suggested and established. If the ore should fail (a contingency which at that day may have been deemed probable), or the manufacture of iron on the estate should cease, the agreement would have accomplished its mission, and the hills might then be parted. Rut until the happening of one or the other of these events, they were to remain appurtenant to the rest of the estate as before. The stipulation about the Bingham tract is an example of a more temporary, as that about the water-right is a more <em>permanent </em>arrangement than this concerning the mine-hills. The Bingham tract was to remain undivided “ for <em>the present,” </em>indicating a right to partition at any convenient time future.

Insurmountable difficulties being found in the way of dividing this part of your estate, we obviate them, by decreeing that you hold it in common, as appurtenant to each of your estates in severalty, and that you use each his proper mine-hole. The ore taken by each can then be estimated, and equity will compel an account among you for the adjustment of balances. Such, in effect, was the language which the decree of the Court addressed to the tenants in 1787, and has ever since sounded in the ears of their successors. That voice is as potential now as it was then, and these parties are as much bound to heed it as their ancestors were, for it is the voice of the law, echoing only the terms of the covenant under which they hold their estates.</p>
