The building insured was thus described in the policy: “ a two story log and frame dwelling-house, and two story kitchen attached, valued at $1500.” Amount of loss payable three months after notice of loss sustained; and containing certain covenants, to the effect that if the premises be altered or applied to other uses which would increase the hazard, then so long as that is the case, the policy is to be of no effect; and that the policy was to be subject to the terms of the Act of Incorporation and By-Laws of the Company.

A committee, appointed by the Board of Managers, reported that the plaintiff had sold the undivided half of the property in October, 1849, and had conveyed the same; <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>that no notice of the sale was given to the Company, and that the policy was not transferred. Also, that Stewart had, by article of agreement, agreed, on 1st July, 1860, to sell to the same person the other undivided half of the property insured, and that the deed was to be made and possession given on 1st of October, 1850. That it was conceded that the Company cannot be held liable for the loss to the one-half of the property sold in 1849, as no notice of the sale was given to the Company within thirty days, nor a transfer of the policy made and approved. That on this account the Company was absolved from this portion of the obligation. The committee estimated the whole loss at $1000, and expressed the opinion that the Company was liable for one-half of it, viz. for the half of the property not conveyed.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b48-7" data-blocks='[["BL_48.7",48,[358,1085,1156,513]]]'>The Company resisted a recovery on the grounds that plaintiff had parted with his entire interest in the premises insured, to James T. Carter and others, by first conveying away the undivided half, and afterwards, and before the fire, the other half, so that at the time of the fire no interest whatever remained in him; and mainly on the ground that plaintiff had added to the building insured after the policy issued, a kitchen, one, or one and a half stories high, and run the pipe of a cooking stove through the roof of the said shanty or kitchen, thereby increasing the risk, and from which the fire actually originated, without giving notice to the Company, agreeably to the <em>fourteenth by-law </em>of said Company, thereby avoiding the policy altogether. The <em>by-law </em>was as follows:</p>

But in case,the agent shall judge that such alterations or additions do increase the risk, he shall say how much, and take an additional note for such increased risk; and the secretary shall enter a minute thereof on the record of said policy, and give to the insured a certificate thereof.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b49-6" data-blocks='[["BL_49.6",49,[160,478,1168,1149]]]'>It is not controverted by plaintiff that a kitchen was added to the building in 1849, of which it does not appear any notice was given to the Company, and if there was no further evidence on this subject defendants would be entitled to your verdict. But plaintiff has called the agent of the Company by whom the application for insurance and the description of the property was taken, who states that at the time the description of the property was given him by plaintiff, that plaintiff communicated to him that he intended to add a kitchen, and gave him a description not only of the house as it then was, but also of the addition intended to be added. On part of plaintiff it is contended that this additional building or kitchen is described in the application ; that this fact was communicated to the committee of the Company at the time the return was made by Mr. Leeds their agent, and that the addition described was not then erected; and with a full knowledge of these facts the application was approved and the policy issued by the Company. If the kitchen erected in 1849 is described with sufficient accuracy in the description given by Mr. Stewart, and the application was approved and policy issued with full knowledge of all the facts by the defendants, we instruct you that the kitchen being added under the circumstances we have mentioned would not avoid the policy. On the other hand, it is contended by defendant that the kitchen is not described, but the application only contains a description of plaintiff’s house as it was at that time. If this is the case, and you should be of opinion that the addition erected in 1849 is not described in the application, then the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>
