The parties were partners for the purpose of fulfilling a contract which George Collyer had made with the Blue Ridge Railroad Company, for cutting a tunnel through the Blue Ridge, in Pickens District, South Carolina. The firm name was George Collyer &amp; Co. The work was commenced by the partners, who continued until December 1857, when they sold out their stock, &amp;0., to Humbird, Hitchcock &amp; Co., settled with the railroad company, and dissolved partnership. The balance due to the firm from the company was $28,833.33, which, according to the allegations of the complainant, was taken up by McNiell and George Coll-yer, McNiell having received $13,833.33, and George Collyer $15,000. The bill of complainant, which was filed May 3d 1858, prayed for an account, an injunction, and a receiver. An injunction was granted and a receiver appointed, but the injunction was afterwards dissolved on the application of George Collyer, who, in his answer, filed June 18th 1858, denied that Robert Collyer was a member of the firm, having sold his interest therein to the respondent.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b258-7" data-blocks='[["BL_258.7",258,[309,1483,1161,250]]]'>To these answers replications were filed September 22d 1858, and a master appointed, by whom a volume of testimony was taken in the cause. On the 11th of June 1859, the bill was dismissed, whereupon the case was removed into this court by the complainant, who assigned the dismissal of his bill by the court below for error.</p>

The preliminary question of the cause, the defendant’s liability to account, was not distinguished from the question how much would be due on the account, and therefore there was no preliminary decree for or against the right to an account, and the bill, answers, and testimony contain an indiscriminate mixture of allegations and evidence on both these questions, and we have nothing to show which of them was decided against the plaintiff.</p>

      <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>Tbe preliminary question ought to have been decided first, and on the pleadings it would have been decided in favour of the plaintiff, but for the defendants’ allegation that the plaintiff had assigned to the defendant Collyer all his interest. The fact of the assignment thus became the preliminary question, and the evidence ought all to have been directed to it. The parties have made that a very complicated question, and we think the decision of if ought to have been referred to a jury, unless the parties prefer a master or referee. We are quite unwilling to decide it. If the part of assignment be proved as alleged, whether made <em>bond fide </em>or with the fraudulent purpose of both parties to make use of it as a means of defrauding the railroad company, then the bill ought to be dismissed; but if not made at all, there ought to be a decree for an account, and then the case ought to go to a master to take the account. That this course may be pursued, we must reverse this decree.</p>

And it is further ordered that on the trial of the issue relative to the assignment, the parties have leave to read in evidence the testimony already taken by the examiner, so far as the same is relevant to said issue.</p>
