This offer was objected to by defendants’ counsel, on the ground that the declaration charged a wrongful and unlawful erection, which, if found for plaintiffs, would destroy the dam of defendants entirely, whilst he had shown by proof already adduced, that the defendants have the right to keep up a dam to a certain height, and so far had a lawful dam. But the court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence, to which the defendants excepted.</p>

Whether the mills were running or standing at the time the water-marks were fixed, can make no possible difference in this case. The real question is, whether appellants’ dam backs the water to an unlawful height. Mr. Erick helped to make one mark July 26th 1849. The parties made another September 15th 1849. By these marks, the surface of the water in Heebner’s dam was to be level with the top of bolts driven into rocks at two points, thus furnishing a gauge by which the stage of the water can be ascertained at any time. Beyond that point appellants had no right to swell the water. Thus the award and the agreement were certain, and the lights of the parties definitely fixed. To resort to the recollection of witnesses for the interpretation of those written instruments, would place the parties in a worse position than they were before.</p>

These agreements were not in the least impeached by any allegation of mistake or fraud in their concoction. This being so, they are to be taken, after the fixing of the marks, as the executed contract of the parties. Under this state of the case, we cannot see how the defendants could reasonably expect to be permitted to prove, what in substance their offer purported, that these fixed marks were not to be held as defining their rights, when the mills were operating, or <em>viee versá. </em>To allow this, would be to interpolate a limitation in the agreement which does not exist in it, and which, it was not alleged, was left out of it by fraud, accident, or mistake.</p>

No ground has been indicated upon which the latter could be relieved from the force and effect of the agreements, and hence we think there was no error in rejecting the testimony proposed. The fact that there might not be water enough for the purposes of this mill, is not the fault of the law, but of the agreement of the parties, and that agreement will be binding until some good reason is shown why it shall be otherwise; but that has not been done on this trial.. The only question properly in the case was, whether the Heebner dam raised the water in an ordinary low stage, above the permanent marks fixed by the parties and their referees; and the offer being, in effect, an effort to substitute a different test from that agreed upon, was properly overruled.
