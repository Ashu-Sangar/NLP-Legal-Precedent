Remington and wife, by three deeds, two of them dated December 3d 1857, and the third dated March 16th 1858, conveyed certain tracts of land in Montgomery county, to Samuel W. Thackara, the Mount Lebanon Cemetery Company, and David L. White. Before the date of the last conveyance, some judgments had been obtained against Remington, which may be disregarded, as they are alleged to be paid, or at least are not represented. Immediately after the date of the last conveyance, other judgments were obtained against Remington, of which it is only necessary to notice that of Daniel 0. Gehr for $3231, and that of Reiss Brothers &amp; Co. for $1834.28, both obtained March 20th 1858; that of H. J. Perrin &amp; Co., for $4801.78, obtained on March 22d 1858; and that of D. B. Birney, obtained on May 22d 1858, for $1683.20. Gehr’s judgment was said to be paid; at least no claim was made upon it. The two next judgments, (which more than exhaust the fund for distribution, if they or those of their class are entitled to claim), were held by John C. Beekman, the appellant.</p>

Abbott issued a <em>testatum fi. fa. </em>from Philadelphia county to Montgomery county, against the defendants Remington and Roberts, for $2924.04, which became a lien under the Act of Assembly.

The interest bought may have been entirely valueless to the purchaser, and yet the money which it produced at a judicial sale is the property of the defendant’s creditors.

It follows, therefore, very plainly, that the li.ens prior to the first sheriff’s sale <em>appear to </em>be discharged, though this-appearance may be changed by showing fraud in that sale.</p>
    <p id="b388-9" data-blocks='[["BL_388.13",388,[308,1190,1163,386]]]'>It is quite as plain that, in a distribution case, though we do not investigate alleged frauds in the title, we must examine the title so far as to ascertain what title was sold and what judgments were liens upon it, so as to be discharged by the sale. The date of the title, and its executed or executory character, are therefore, often very essential questions: 9 Casey 296. A judgment. is a lien according to the title which the defendant has or appears to have : and if he had'no title when the judgment was entered, of course it is no lien, for there can be no lien on nothing.</p>

The record shows all these later judgments to be liens against that title or chance of title, and they are entitled to the proceeds of the sale of it, and the purchaser obtains a position that enables him to try the fraud by an action of ejectment. . The prior liens were not entered against that contingent title, but against the prior one, and they already appear of record as discharged by the prior sale, and they can be restored only by the proof, and not by the mere hypothesis, of the fraud. The • purchaser at the second sheriff’s sale can maintain his title only by proving the fraud in ■ the first; and, therefore, by maintaining it, he would seem to reinstate the prior unsatisfied liens.
