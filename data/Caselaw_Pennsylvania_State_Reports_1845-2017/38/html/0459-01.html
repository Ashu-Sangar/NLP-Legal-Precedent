Thomas, Esquires, two of the commissioners of said county, and the representatives of the said Margaret A. Dornan, and having heard their proofs and allegations, it was alleged by the commissioners (and admitted by the parties present) that the road had not been opened according to the draft laid out by the viewers of said street or road, but changed more at right angles through the property, in accordance with the views of the representative of the owner, and a committee of the Borough Council of Pottsville, as was admitted.

Doman applied to the court for the appointment of viewers to assess the damages alleged to have been done to her. property, by reason of opening the road or street through it. The report of the viewers appointed by the court on that petition being confirmed, is now here on <em>certiorari, </em>and the exceptions to this proceeding are now to be considered.</p>
    <p id="b462-10" data-blocks='[["BL_462.14",462,[316,1948,1163,429]]]'>Neither of the Acts of the 22d of April 1856, referred to by the plaintiffs in error, do we think have any operation in this case. The first of them, relating to “streets, lanes, and alleys in the borough of Pottsville,” expressly saves all proceedings begun before its passage. The second, which is a Supplement to the Act regulating Boroughs, is expressly prospective in its provisions in regard to proceedings in laying out and opening streets. These acts, therefore, do not affect the petitioner’s right to resort to the county for the damage done to the property by the opening of the street in question, if any were sustained.</p>

Now, as the viewers were not appointed to find any fact of this kind, their report on the point is no evidence of the fact. There being no other evidence in the case to cover the point, it is not to be considered at all.</p>

There a supervisor attempted to open a road on different ground from that on which it had been originally opened, without any new order. He was sued for trespass and held liable, although the road was not opened originally on the right ground, and although he proposed to open it where it had been located. So here, the road being opened, it would remain until changed under proceedings for that purpose in court.</p>
