The court below refused to allow plaintiffs to bring Dr. Wetherill into Schuylkill county, or to give judgment against the other defendants, thus depriving them of a remedy for a grievous wrong, unless Mr. Wetherill should visit Berks or Schuylkill county before they are barred by the Statute of Limitations.</p>
