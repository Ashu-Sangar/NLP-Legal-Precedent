Railroad Company, 11 Harris 384, we decided, that where several persons are employed as workmen in the same general service, and one of them is injured through the carelessness of another, the employer is not responsible. Many cases were there cited in support of this principle, and many more might be added now: 10 Mees. &amp; W. 109; 5 Com. B. R. 599, 616; 9 Exch. 223; 11 Id. 832; 16 Queen’s B.

    <p id="b111-6" data-blocks='[["BL_111.6",111,[242,489,1163,342]]]'>This rule was not disregarded on the trial, but if the company employ a conductor known by them to be unfit for the business, this new fact changes the question to be solved, and tho court below charged, that in such a case the company are chargeable with the consequences of the carelessness of the conductor. This instruction seems to us correct, and is supported by many decisions cited by the plaintiff’s counsel, to which may be added Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Barbour, 6 Ohio St. R. 541.</p>
    <p id="b111-7" data-blocks='[["BL_111.7",111,[241,831,1162,430]]]'>But if the plaintiff knew that his conductor was habitually careless, and chose to continue in service with him, and did not inform the company, of his known acts of carelessness and refuse to serve with him, he can have no claim against the company for injuries suffered from further carelessness, even if the company did also know: 25 Alab. 659; <a href="/barb/20/0449-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="20 Barb. 449" data-case-ids="4971635" data-case-paths="/barb/20/0449-01">20 Barb. 449</a>; 28 Id. 80; 4 Seld. 175; 5 Ohio St. R. 541; 2 Hurlst. &amp; N. 258, 768; 9 Excheq. 223; 27 Law T. R. 325; 28 Id. 139; Smith’s Master and Servant 147, 150. The court below was in error in refusing to give this instruction to the jury.</p>
    <p id="b111-8" data-blocks='[["BL_111.8",111,[238,1260,1164,547]]]'>It is not the company, but their officer having charge of this department of their business, that is expected to use ordinary care in the employment of proper conductors and other servants. His carelessness in this respect is theirs, and his knowledge is theirs: 28 Barbour 80. It was, therefore, quite relevant and important to show that Thomas A. Scott, the superintendent, did not know that the conductor was a careless officer; supposing that the employment and oversight of conductors was part of the functions of the superintendent, which does not appear in the evidence, but seems to have been assumed. Standing for the company in this respect, his knowledge becomes one of the very issues in the cause, and the court was in error in rejecting the evidence.</p>
