The amendment was improperly allowed; it altered the cause of action, alleging a covenant with parties other than those named in the <em>narr., </em>in regard to whom no breaches were assigned.

The pleadings put upon the defendant the necessity of proving the performance of his covenant: Martin <em>v. </em>Ilammon, 8 Barr 271. And we insist that an agreement to <em>sell, assign, and set over all the right, title, interest or estate </em>of and in certain <em>leasehold joremises, </em>is a covenant that plaintiffs have a right, title, interest, estate, and claim which they agree to sell, assign, and set over. The fact that our possession was not disturbed, does not matter. A vendee is not bound to restore possession and give up his contract, before he can resist an action for purchase-money on the ground of defective title: Gans <em>v. </em>Renshaw, 2 Barr 34.

If not, and it was necessary, as we aver, for Hite to purchase the Crawford title, in order to secure himself for the money previously paid to plaintiffs, then their right to recover in this action required them to show, by exhibiting their lease, their right, title, and interest in it. They claimed to recover without showing any muniment of title, or proving that such an agreement as that cited in the contract between Crawford and others had any existence, but, by giving in evidence the contract declared on, and the possession of Sproule, without showing any connection between them.</p>

In the absence of evidence of title, the court below should have decided, as a matter of equity, that the price agreed upon was so far beyond the value of a possessory right, that it would be a fraud to enforce it's payment, or should at least have referred the matter in that shape to the jury.</p>

We will not stop to inquire as to the validity of this plea under this contract, but will notice the proof to sustain it. He exhibited a purchase by himself at Orphans’ Court sale, of the tract of land out of which the leasehold interest sold by the plaintiffs to him had been carved. But the very petition which prayed for the sale, asked for it, with a reservation of the privileges which he held under the agreement of sale from the plaintiffs. Of this petition, it being the foundation of his title, he would be bound to take notice. This was certainly not a paramount title to that of the plaintiffs, so far as it now appears, and therefore not an available outstanding title, to which he would have been bound to surrender, and could not avail as a defence.</p>
