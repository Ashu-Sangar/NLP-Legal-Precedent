The amount of said- sale, as returned by the trustee, was $23,873.40. The only parties interested in the trust property were Solomon and Daniel Apple, who were entitled to one half, and the grandchildren of the testator (represented by their respective guardians, Amor Walker and Jesse Alexander), who were entitled to the other half among them. In the return of sale made to the Orphans’ Court, made February 6th 1852, the two pieces of real estate were returned as sold to Walker and Alexander. The one, at Fourth and Brown streets, for $8500; the other, on Germantown Hoad, for $3125. After this sale a statement of the trust property was made by the trustee, and Solomon and Daniel Apple agreed that the guardians of the minors should have the said properties at the prices mentioned, while the cash proceeds of the sale should be paid to them ; upon this agreement they received one-half of the sum, $23,873.40, less ten per cent., which they allowed the trustee to retain for his commissions. This arrangement appears to have been in accordance with an agreement made in December 1851, by which Solomon and Daniel Apple consented that Walker, representing the minors, should have the Fourth and Brown streets property for the amount named.</p>

After a careful study of all the reports, and the opinions of the courts upon them, and making ourselves acquainted with all the proceedings from first to last in this troublesome trust, and so with the merits of the exceptions now before us, we are constrained to say, that we see nothing to change or modify in the decree of the Common Pleas. The reasons given by the auditor for the non-allowance of commissions on the sum of $1290.87 are satisfactory. It plainly appears that the collection of the rents, aggregating that sum, was an unnecessary and self-imposed duty, resulting from what might be called a perverse withholding of a conveyance of the property from whence they were derived. Had the conveyance been made, the collections would not have been required to have been made by the appellant. Under such circumstances, the trustee could not claim compensation for services resulting from his own wrong. Nor do we see any error in charging him with the interest on the sums so received.
