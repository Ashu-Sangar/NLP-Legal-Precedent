The bills of lading accompanying the cargoes, and the drafts drawn against them, were sometimes in the names of Simmons &amp; McClees, sometimes in that of McClees &amp; Simmons, and frequently in the name of S. S. Simmons alone. Simmons &amp; McClees were partners in the business in which they were engaged. The ledger of the plaintiffs in error disclosed accounts with, Simmons &amp; McClees as a firm, and an account with S. S. Simmons. Norcross &amp; Sheets had treated Simmons and Simmons &amp; McClees as identical, S. S. Simmons being the active and managing partner of the firm of Simmons &amp; McClees.</p>

Among others, a draft dated August 18th 1855, drawn for $1500, at ninety days, by S. S. Simmons in favour of and endorsed by James McClees, and accepted and paid by Messrs. Norcross &amp; Sheets.</p>

S. Simmons and of which sum they had credited to McClees and Simmons, an amount sufficient to liquidate the apparent balance due to McClees &amp; Simmons, and charged to S. S. Simmons the amount of the apparent balance due to Simmons &amp; McClees. To this transfer on their books it did not appear that any objection had ever been made by either Simmons or McClees. Had this transfer of accounts been allowed, there would have been nothing in the hands of these plaintiffs in error due to McClees &amp; Simmons. Or had the judge permitted the defendants below to have given in evidence the draft of $1,500, it would have appeared that in fact there was nothing, in the hands of these garnishees at the time of the attachment, or afterwards.</p>

This is the general question. They do owe them, as the jury have found, unless they have a right to charge Simmons &amp; McClees with a draft of Simmons in favour of McClees, paid by them, or to charge Simmons &amp; McClees with a debt due to them by Simmons. Of course they can do neither of these things without some evidence tending to show that the apparently individual contracts of Simmons are really the contracts of Simmons &amp; McClees, or that McClees has assented to such a charge. The forms of the proceeding are all against it, and as a matter of fact, Simmons was actually carrying on a business by himself. The draft shows a debt of Simmons to McClees, paid by Norcross &amp; Sheets; that it would not be paid at all if it be charged to Simmons &amp; McClees. To show that Simmons was the entire partner, makes out nothing against McClees in a transaction where he professedly acted for himself alone, and not for his firm. We see no sort of evidence, rejected or admitted, that could justify a finding that the draft of Simmons or the balance due by him was properly chargeable to Simmons &amp; McClees, and therefore we discover no error in the trial.</p>
