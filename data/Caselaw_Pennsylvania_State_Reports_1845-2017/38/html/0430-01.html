Upon the death of Frances M. without issue, the estate belonged to Joseph Y. and Ann E., as tenants in tail with cross-remainders. Upon Ann’s death it-passed to Joseph as tenant in tail, and upon 'his death without issue lawfully begotten, the estate under the will passed to the right heirs of Amor Marshall, and the right heirs of his wife Mary Marshall, as they argued, not <em>per </em>capita, but one-half to. each set of heirs, giving consequently to the complainant one* sixth of these properties. The word <em>“heirs,” </em>as used by the testator, must be treated as synonymous with <em>“issue,” </em>to effectuate his intention: see 3 Barr 304 ; 5 <a href="/watts-serg/7/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 195" data-case-ids="481826" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0195-01">Id. 264</a>.

If she claims as one of the “right heirs” of Mrs. Mary Marshall, she cannot succeed, because Mrs. Marshall took no estate in these properties but her dower, and therefore could transmit none.

An estate limited to the heirs of any one, is of course contingent until the death of that person; but it vests as soon as it can. The contingency in this case was removed by the death of Mrs. M. in 1854, when it vested in her <em>right heirs, </em>to wit, her children.</p>

The limitation is to them, whoever they should be at her death — why then should not the right heir, existing when th'at event happened, take the remainder rather than others, who in another contingency might have been the right heirs of testator and his wife ?

If heirs here means his children, then their estate could not run out, because this very formal limitation of a remainder would amount merely to a <em>reversion. </em>But evidently he means to provide devisees of the remainder after the estates tail, and therefore he means, not heirs properly speaking, but the next of kin to himself and his wife, after excluding their children. The remainder vested in them on his death. At that time the father’s collateral relatives were eight brothers and sisters.
