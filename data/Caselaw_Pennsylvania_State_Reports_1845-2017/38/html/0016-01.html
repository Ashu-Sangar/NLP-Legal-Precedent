If the receipt, notes, and due-bill referred to were not given until after the execution and delivery of the letter of the 13th February 1854, and if they were given without consideration, or for a consideration arising subsequently thereto, and after notice of the assignment of the bond and judgment to Patricks &amp; Friend, then they constitute no defence as to the amount advanced by Patricks &amp; Friend to Eldred, and to secure the payment of which the bond and judgment were assigned as collateral security, <em>even if the jury should find that the letter of the 13tli of February </em>1854 <em>was not actually signed and delivered to Patríeles Friend until after the delivery of the drafts and the assignment of the judgment. </em>But if the notes and due-bill <em>‘ </em>represented a <em>bond fide </em>indebtedness which was ascertained and fixed before the assignment by Eldred,’ then, although ante-dated and delivered after the assignment of the judgment to Patricks &amp; Friend, they constitute a good defence as against the said Patricks &amp; Friend, and their assignee, except so'much as was advanced by Patricks &amp; Friend on the faith of the letter of the 13th of February 1854, after the same came to their hands. And if nothing was advanced thereafter, there can be no recovery in this case. The facts are for the determination of the jury. The legal presumption is, that the papers referred to, viz. the receipt notes and due-bill, were signed and delivered on the days and at the times they respectively bear date. But this presumption may be rebutted by evidepce showing the fact to be otherwise. The only evidence tending to rebut this presumption is the letter of 13th February 1854, and the forms, conditions, and stipulations of the bond itself, to which your attention has been called by the plaintiff’s counsel. If you find that the letter of 13th February 1854 is a true paper — that it was voluntarily given by Dr. Hazlett — it is evidence, taken in connection with the bond itself, tending to rebut the existence of the papers bearing <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>date anterior to the letter. The letter contains admissions against the interest of Dr. Hazlett, and inconsistent with the defence now set up. If can admit of but one of two constructions, as it seems to me, consistent with honesty and fair dealing — either that the facts stated therein are true, and that Dr. Hazlett had no defence to the bond, or if he had, that he was willing to forego that defence so far as it respects Patricks &amp; Friend; and that it might stand as security for such an amount as they might advance thereon. The jury will determine, from all the evidence in the cause, what are the facts in the case, and whether they are, or are not, as alleged by the plaintiffs.</p>

But the plaintiffs contend that if the receipt and note for $6500, bearing even date with the bond, and the other notes and due-bill given in evidence, were executed and delivered On the days and at the times they respectively bear date, that the bond was created to enable Eldred to raise money on it by assignment, sale, or pledge, and that the said papers, to wit, the receipt, notes and due-bill referred to, were contrived or concocted to enable him to defraud or impose upon any person who might purchase or advance money upon said bond. And if the facts be as alleged, then these papers cannot be set up as a defence to this action, either as to the amount for which the bond and judgment were pledged to Patricks &amp; Friend, or as to the amount advanced thereon by Mrs. Patrick. But Eldred and Hazlett had the right to make any arrangement between themselves for the satisfaction of the bond at the time it was given, if it was not intended as a means to defraud others, that they might see fit; and such an arrangement would be as good and effectual a defence against the assignees of the bond, who had taken it without inquiry, as against Eldred himself. If the papers referred to were not executed for the purpose of enabling the parties to defraud those who might become purchasers or assignees of the bond, then the defendant may set them up as against the assignees with the same effect as he could against Eldred himself, except so far as they may have advanced their money on the faith of the representations contained in the letter of Hazlett of the 13th of February 1854, if the jury find the letter to be genuine.</p>

The first assignment of error is to the action of the court in opening the judgment for want of appearance in No. 599 of November Term 1859, being a judgment on a <em>sci. fa. de novo quare ex. non </em>in this case. Opening judgments is usually matter of discretion; but if it were not so, we could not correct the error here, for the record in that case is not before us. No other answer is needed to this assignment.</p>
    <p id="b32-6" data-blocks='[["BL_32.10",32,[312,728,1161,472]]]'>2 and 3. The revival of the original judgment- is but a continuation of it. In form the proceeding by <em>sci. fa. </em>is a distinct action, but in fact is not so. Satisfaction of the original judgment is a satisfaction of the judgment in the <em>sci. fa. </em>So a reversal of the former has the same effect on the latter: 12 S. &amp; R. 412. Here the attempt is to control the original by the secondary judgment — to make the latter conclusive as to what the former must be — to raise the stream above the fountain. This would invert the order of precedence altogether; and it needs no argument to prove that the court were right in refusing to charge that the judgment was conclusive or any evidence whatever.</p>
    <p id="b32-7" data-blocks='[["BL_32.11",32,[310,1200,1159,259]]]'>On this record, however, there was not room for any controversy in regard to the point, inasmuch as the conclusiveness of the judgment was destroyed by being opened. We cannot inquire at what moment this was done, but will presume it was done during the trial. In either point of sight, the ruling of the court was right.</p>
    <p id="b32-8" data-blocks='[["BL_32.12",32,[311,1458,1157,86]]]'>4 and 5. These errors are not sustained, as the points were substantially answered in the general charge.</p>
    <p id="b32-9" data-blocks='[["BL_32.13",32,[305,1544,1164,383]]]'>6. This error is based upon a supposed erroneous instruction in regard to the amount the plaintiffs might recover, if entitled to recover at all. It was, that they could recover no more than the assignees of the testator could have recovered if suing. This left the jury free to find a verdict for the plaintiffs to that extent, if the evidence should justify it. But the jury found that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover anything. That a larger sum was not indicated as the basis of recovery, seems to have been of no consequence, since it appears that nothing was due.</p>
    <p id="b32-10" data-blocks='[["BL_32.14",32,[302,1927,1162,473]],["BL_33.1",33,[221,404,1161,163]]]'>7. The testimony, the admission of which and instructions thereon form the seventh specification of error, was received under the fifth plea of the defendants, viz. that the plaintiff by the instrument of writing <em>“ </em>agreed to surrender to the defendant the bond in controversy.” The replication to this and to other matters pleaded, was, that the defendants were estopped from setting up the several matters in the pleas contained, by the written and verbal acknowledgments of the defendants’ intestate before the assignment of the bond and judgment. It would follow of necessity, then, if the estoppel failed, that the instrument of writing of the 4th of March 1854 would have just such <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>effect as its character would entitle it to have, and of course no more. This being the state of the pleadings, I can see no error in admitting it. But can this be said of the instructions in regard to it? We shall see.</p>
    <p id="b33-5" data-blocks='[["BL_33.5",33,[220,577,1162,472]]]'>It was an executory declaration or promise without consideration to surrender up the bond of $8000 upon a certain contingency. That contingency had not happened, and there was neither time, place, nor circumstance fixed for testing whether “ Hazlett and all other <em>bond fide </em>stockholders were or were not liable to pay the remaining sums due on all the shares held by them to said company, by due course of law.” If not liable, the bond was to be surrendered. This naked unexecuted proposition, without a consideration to support it, would bind nobody; and to allow it effect as a defence would be error, but perhaps without injury in this case.</p>
    <p id="b33-6" data-blocks='[["BL_33.6",33,[217,1049,1161,429]]]'>That it might become effective under the remark of the learned judge, embraced in this assignment, can hardly be doubted. It was this: “ The jury will give to that instrument (of the 4th of March 1854) no consideration whatever, if they find that Hazlett had notice of the assignment of the judgment to Patricks &amp; Friend when the paper was delivered to him by Eldred.” This was a negative pregnant, and the converse of the proposition would be sure to be followed in case notice was not proved, and in this way effect would be given to an instrument entitled to none, under any circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b33-7" data-blocks='[["BL_33.7",33,[213,1479,1161,558]]]'>So, too, of the remark in regard to notice. I cannot but think it was calculated to mislead the jury. The assignment on the record was constructive notice to the defendant as well as to others: 1 Harris 620; 10 Id. 300; 1 Casey 80; 5 Id. 401. It was dated 13th February 1854. That was notice — but the learned judge put that matter contingently, and in such a way as to lead the jury to believe that actual notice must be shown. Had he not meant this, he should have instructed the jury that there was constructive notice before the receipt of the paper by Hazlett, by virtue of the assignment on the docket, and therefore the paper was inoperative and not to be considered by them. But, conceding that there was error in these particulars, did it do the plaintiff any injury ? If not, we will not reverse.</p>
    <p id="b33-8" data-blocks='[["BL_33.8",33,[209,2038,1161,387]],["BL_34.1",34,[322,399,1157,432]]]'>Let us recur to the state of the record and the testimony. The plaintiff claimed by virtue of the assignment of Patricks &amp; Friend, .and introduced, after giving in evidence the bond and assignment, the letter of the 13th February 1854. If that letter was genuine, it estopped Hazlett or his administrators from denying the debt so far as Patricks &amp; Friend were concerned, at least as to so much of it as they acquired title to by advance after its receipt. If not genuine, then there was nothing to interpose between the set-off and the assignee, and by this means <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>tbe bond would be satisfied, whether as a bond for $1500 or $8000. I see nothing in the case to prevent this result. The jury undoubtedly found against the genuineness of the letter, and this necessarily resulted in a verdict for the defendants. The instruction complained of had no tendency whatever to influence the jury as to this main point, and for that reason, even if erroneous, was harmless. On all the real points of the case the instructions of the learned judge were eminently impartial, lucid, and fair; and we feel bound, for the reasons given, to affirm tide judgment.</p>
