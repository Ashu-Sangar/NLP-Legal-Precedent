Such nowhere appears upon the record. The record shows that the <em>fi. fa. </em>issued April 5th 1858, returnable to the first Monday of the following May. That on the 24th day of April 1858, the court granted a rule to set aside the <em>fi. fa. </em>with a <em>stay of proceeding in the meantime. </em>That during the pendency of the last-mentioned rule, the plaintiff, notwithstanding the stay of proceedings on the <em>fi. fa., </em>proceeded to sell and sold, the goods and chattels levied upon, April 27th 1858.</p>
    <p id="b485-7" data-blocks='[["BL_485.7",485,[230,1322,1165,170]]]'>The court never removed the stay of proceedings. Under this state of facts there was no vitality in the writ, at the time the sale was effected under it, and the court was right in setting the <em>fi. fa. </em>and sale aside.</p>
    <p id="b485-8" data-blocks='[["BL_485.8",485,[226,1488,1168,260]]]'>Again, it is said the only power the court had to set aside the sale, was derived from the Act of Assembly of April 10th 1849. But this power inheres in the court to prevent an abuse of its process, and if abused to nullify the act thus abusing it, independent of that act. But according to this very act, had not the court the power to set aside the sale and to direct an issue ?</p>
    <p id="b485-9" data-blocks='[["BL_485.9",485,[223,1749,1169,333]]]'>The plaintiff complains that the court below, by setting aside <em>t)iefi.fa., </em>destroyed his lien. That depends altogether whether he had any lien to destroy. If Clark was deceased at the time the judgment was entered, the <em>fi. fa. </em>was null and void, and had no vital force with which to generate a lien. The cases cited do not show that a writ of error <em>coram nobis </em>was the exclusive remedy, but simply establish that he might have sued out a writ of error <em>coram nobis.</em>

Clark disappeared mysteriously. Success in business, the respect he commanded in his social relations, and devotion to his wife, are certainly some reasons why he should not absent himself from his home, unless by constraint or violence. With all these influences surrounding him, why did he not return to his home and to his young wife, as he was wont, unless he was dead ? 1 Greenl. Ev. 187-8, § 108.</p>

Following the old fictions of the English law, we might exclude fractions of a day in inquiring whether the death took place before the entry of the judgment, and thus exclude the testimony of Chapouty, the clerk who entered it, that it could not have been entered earlier than eight o’clock in the morning.
