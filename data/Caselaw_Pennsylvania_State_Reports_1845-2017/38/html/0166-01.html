However much the rule may be relaxed in regard to bequests of personalty, it is inflexible as regards devises of realty; that words such as are used in this will import an indefinite failure of issue. Smith, in his work on Executory Interests, p. 588, collects a large number of cases, and remarks in regard to them, that “it will be perceived that, as regards real estate, no distinction exists between the words ‘ die without issue,’ and ‘die without leaving issue,’ and ‘in default,’ or on failure,’ and ‘for want of issue,’ but that all those expressions, in devises made before the year 1838 (the date of the recent British statute), are construed to import of themselves an indefinite failure of issue.” The rule has again and again been asserted to be the law of Pennsylvania.
