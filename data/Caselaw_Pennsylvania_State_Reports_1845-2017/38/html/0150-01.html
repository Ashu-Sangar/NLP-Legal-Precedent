Judgment was entered on this bond in the District Court of Philadelphia, March 18th 1859, in which the proviso as to interest was entered on the record. On the 16th of August 1860, the record of this judgment was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Delaware county (and entered as in the original entry) by the plaintiff, <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>who on the same day issued an execution, under which the farm of defendant was levied on and condemned. On the 24th of September 1860, a <em>vend. ex. </em>was issued, and on the 8th of November 1860, the farm was sold by the sheriff for $4600.</p>

The judgment is to secure the payment of the debt in five years, with interest annually, and with a provision that, on default of sixty days in paying interest, the whole debt shall be due. The execution was not issued until five months after the first year’s interest had become due, and therefore it appears to be quite regular. Such judgments, obtained by confession and without writ, are under the equitable control of the court, and if the defendant below had really paid the interest, he could and ought to have shown that fact to the court below, and then the execution would have been set aside. This is not the place to show that fact; but even here it is not alleged: See Banning <em>v. </em>Taylor, 12 Harris 289*</p>
