By the report of this auditor there was a balance of $208.88 distributed to Mrs. Simpson. The above receipt was not before him, but. there was evidence of its existence and of the circumstances under which it was procured, which induced him to disregard it. This report was confirmed September 28th 1857. On the petition of one of the executors, the matter was referred back to the same auditor, who, after a hearing, returned his report unchanged. Objection being made to the confirmation of this report, the matter was argued, and on the 6th of June 1860 the report was finally confirmed. From this decree Bushrod W. Horton, one of the executors, appealed to this court, assigning for error the decree of the Orphans’ Court in the premises.</p>

That Mrs. Simpson’s legacy was not payable, because, by the sale of the principal part of the estate, the will had been revoked: Cooper’s Estate, <em>4 </em>Barr 92. By adding her advancement to what had been paid to her by the executors, it would appear that she had more than her share, supposing the deceased to have died intestate.
