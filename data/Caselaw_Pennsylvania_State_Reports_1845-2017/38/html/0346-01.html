The said lessee covenanted for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, to pay, or to cause to be paid, to Davis and wife, or their legal representatives, the sum of $250 in advance every six months, the first payment to be made on the 8th day of May 1851, the second on the 8th day of November next following, and the said sum to be paid semi-annually thereafter until the ore-leave shall amount to $1000 per year, then the semi-annual payments to cease; but if at any time thereafter the amount of ore should fall short of the $1000 per year, the <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>semi-annual rent to be continued, and $3 per ton over tbe above-mentioned $1000 per year.</p>

The company opened a mine on the premises, sunk a shaft, and erected a steam-engine with the necessary gearing for the purpose of working the mine, and commenced the business of mining.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b347-8" data-blocks='[["BL_347.8",347,[229,1092,1161,1248]]]'>This business was continued until the 9th day of April, A. D. 1854, when the engine was stopped and the company ceased operations, paying no rent after that time, but leaving the engine with all its gearing, and a number of mining tools, on the demised premises. The work has not since been resumed. On the 10th day of November 1857, Dendy Sharwood obtained judgment, in the District Court of Philadelphia, for $1083.38 against the company, which, on the 7th day of December following, was marked to- the use of Alfred A. Moss, a transcript of which, on the 13th day of January, A. D. 1858, was filed in the Common Pleas of Chester county. On the same day a <em>fieri facias </em>was issued, and all the property of the defendant on the demised premises, including the engine and gearing, was levied on, and under a <em>venditioni exponas </em>to the following term, sold by the sheriff on the 28th day of March 1858, to Joseph L. Moss, the plaintiff. The defendant gave notice at the sale that he claimed the engine and fixtures as a part of his real estate. The property levied on was one stationary steam-engine, three cylindrical boilers, twenty fathoms of cast-iron pumps, a lot of raising buckets, wheel-barrows, hand-barrows, timber shovels, a lot of zinc, oil-hoisting rope, and other implements of mining. April 30th 1858, the proceeds of sale, amounting to $523.01, were paid into court at the instance of the plaintiff, who moved for leave to take the same out of court, May 5th 1858. On motion of the counsel for Davis the landlord, a rule was granted to show cause why he should not take out of court $250 for six months’ rent due him before the lease became void, provided there was that much arising from the sale of the property admitted to be personalty.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="ApC" data-blocks='[["BL_348.6",348,[306,503,1163,1068]]]'>Before the auditor, the counsel for the landlord made no claim for rent upon the proceeds of sale arising from the sale of the engine and fixtures, but only on that part of the fund produced by the sale of the property which the landlord alleged was personal estate. The counsel for the execution-creditor claimed the whole proceeds, on the ground, that by the terms of the contract the lease should become void if the lessee ceased mining operations for twelve consecutive months before the execution issued, that the lease having been thus avoided the landlord had no right to distrain, and was therefore not entitled to claim any arrearages of rent out of the proceeds of sale. The auditor adopted that view, and reported against the claim of the landlord, who took exceptions to the report which remain undetermined. After the Montgomery Mining Company ceased operations on the demised premises, they, from time to time, entered and removed therefrom mining implements and tools of various kinds, greased the engine and kept it protected from injury, and after the sale by the sheriff, the purchaser, by his workmen, exercised the same kind of care over it to prevent corrosion by rust, and other injury resulting from exposure, by means of which it has been preserved in working order. This, however, was done without the observation, knowledge, or consent of the defendant. The engine, boilers, and fixtures belonging to it were sold at the sheriff’s sale for $400, pile of cast-iron pipes used for pumps at $26, 25 fathoms of ten-inch pipes for pumps at $25.</p>

The defendant forbade the plaintiff’s agents to remove the engine, boilers and fixtures belonging to it, and the pipes, claiming them as a part of the real estate. The plaintiff subsequently made demand of the property so purchased by him; but the defendant refused to give up the engine, boilers and fixtures, and pipes. The engine is a stationary steam-engine of eighty horse power, with three boilers about thirty feet in length, and thirty inches in diameter. There were twenty-five fathoms of cast-iron pumps, which were worked by one engine — a hoisting-machine and pumping gear suitable for the engine and pumps. A pit about twenty feet in length, nine feet in width, and ten feet in depth, was sunk in the ground. Another pit about four feet from the other, was sunk about the same depth, about thirty feet in length and five feet in width. These pits were filled with masonry, stone, and mortar, leaving places through which to pass a number of iron bolts, keyed at a point about eighteen inches from the foundation of the masonwork, passing through the iron plates forming part of the engine and secured at the top of said plates with nuts. <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>Passages were left to the keys in the bolts near the bottom of the masonwork, so that those keys could be taken out at any time, and the bolts thus removed by lifting them up. The engine was fastened to the masonwork by the bolts passing through the iron plates on the top of the masonwork. When the bolts are unkeyed and lifted out the engine is entirely loose, and may be removed from the foundation. A frame building of sufficient size to protect the engine from the weather, was built over it. The pumps were intended to rest upon the bottom of the shaft. The object of the engine and of the articles of the machinery connected with it, was to pump water out of the mines that have been opened and were worked by the company, and were used for that purpose, because the mining operations could not have been carried on below the water level without these articles or others of a similar character. They were fastened to the freehold in the ordinary and proper mode, the boilers were masoned in and covered with brickwork. The plaintiff claimed the property as belonging to him by virtue of the sheriff’s sale, and also to recover damages for the refusal by the defendant to give up the same, and for the conversion thereof as aforesaid.</p>

The question for the opinion of the court was, whether the plaintiff under these circumstances was entitled to recover. If so, judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for 6 cents damages and costs of suit; if not, then judgment to be rendered for the defendant for the sum of §1200 and costs.</p>

The work has not since been resumed. On the 28th March 1858, nearly four <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>years after suspension of mining operations, the sheriff, by virtue of a writ of <em>vend. exp. </em>issued at the suit of a judgment-creditor against the mining company, sold the engine and its fixtures and the mining tools to the plaintiff Joseph L. Moss, after notice given by the defendant that he claimed the engine and fixtures as a part of his real estate.</p>

If á tenant remain in possession after the expiration of his term, and perform all the conditions of the lease, it amounts to a renewal of the lease from year to year, and I take it he would be entitled to remove fixtures during the year.</p>

The entry of the company’s agents to clean and grease the engine from time to time, was not a continuance of mining operations within the meaning of the lease. Nor was any entry by the landlord necessary to declare the forfeiture, for he was already in possession for all purposes except mining: Hamilton <em>v. </em>Elliot, 5 S. &amp; R. 375. The law of entry for breach of condition in the tenure is somewhat different with us from what it is in England and in many of our surrounding states. We took occasion to point out the distinction in a recent case from the Westtern District, Shaeffer <em>v. </em>Shaeffer, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20525" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="1 Wright 525">1 Wright 525</a>. In England the forfeiture, however strongly the condition is expressed in the deed, is not complete until the landlord elects by some positive act to take advantage of it. With us it depends on the terms of the instrument, unless there be evidence to affect the landlord with a waiver of the breach, like the receipt of rent or other equally unequivocal act. When this lease was before us last year in Moss’s Appeal, 11 Casey 164, on the distribution of the proceeds of what was admitted to be personal chattels of the mining company, we treated the term as surrendered to the landlord and merged in his reversionary estate. We can regard it in no other light now. A discontinuance of mining operations for nearly four years before the sheriff’s sale, must be held to work a forfeiture of the lease, or we unmake the contract of the parties. There is nothing in the case from which we can imply the landlord’s inten<a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>tion to waive the palpable breach, and therefore he must have the benefit of it, and we must say that, the term being ended, the right of the tenant or of the sheriff’s vendee to remove the engine, fell with the term. That the engine was so attached to the freehold as to be a part of the realty cannot be doubted under our decisions, and though the tenant might have secured it during his term, it is too late for the exercise of this right three years after his term was at an end.</p>
    <p id="b354-6" data-blocks='[["BL_354.6",354,[307,748,1159,212]]]'>The learned counsel attempted to avert the consequences of this view of their case, by arguing that the engine with its gearing was not attached to the subject of the grant, but was erected on the surface of the land by the express permission and license of Davis the lessor, outside of the demised estate.</p>
    <p id="b354-7" data-blocks='[["BL_354.7",354,[306,962,1157,640]]]'>It is not necessary for us to consider the argument erected on such a basis, for we cannot concede the fundamental postulate. We hold that the engine was attached to the subject of the grant. We have seen what the grant was — the entire mining right, with the privilege of erecting the necessary fixtures. So much of the surface as was necessary to the full enjoyment of this right, was expressly included in the lease. Whether the whole thing granted was of the nature of a corporeal or an incorporeal hereditament is not necessary to be decided, but that it included the ground on which the engine rested is past all reasonable doubt. We cannot so read the lease as to raise a doubt. The mining company held that ground on the same terms and conditions as the right of ways — the shaft, the copper, and the lead. They held them all under and according to the lease, and when they forfeited the lease, they lost them all.</p>
