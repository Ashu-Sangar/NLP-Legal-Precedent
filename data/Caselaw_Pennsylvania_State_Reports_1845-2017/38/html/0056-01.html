    <p class="summary" id="b56-10" data-blocks='[["BL_56.10",56,[298,1186,1170,896]]]'>This was an action brought by J. M. Spriggs, executor of the last will and testament of William Duvall against J. W. Darby, Hugh McClelland, and A. Wallace, on an accommodation note for $1650 dated May 29th 1856, signed by defendants, made payable to Darby &amp; Craig and by them endorsed to plaintiff’s testator. The plea was <em>non assumpsit </em>and payment with leave. The defence was, that Duvall had not purchased the note, but that it had been left with him by Darby as collateral security on th.e purchase of a note for $300 dated June 4th 1856. In the course of the trial the defendant proved by J. P. Gamble, that he “ lived in Washington in the spring of 1856, when he met Darby, who had a note for $1650 signed by defendants, and another for $300 which he offered to sell; that he did not see the note but declined negotiating it; that he met Darby again on the 4th of June 1856, but did not see the notes; that in the evening he met Duvall and asked him how he got along in his trade with Darby, and was told that he had made a nice thing of it, that it did not take much, and that $300 was not much;” and then called R. M. Gibson, who after stating that he had a conversation with Duvall shortly before his death, in which he informed Duvall that Darby was about to fail, testified as follows:—</p>

B. Wolf, that in the latter part of May 1856, Duvall called on him and notified him, that he (Duvall) wished the witness to get the balance of the $1300 loan ready for him, as he wanted it to help him purchase a note from Darby, on Darby, McClelland, and others, and told witness to be sure and have it ready — the balance was about $900 or $1000 — to be followed by proof that the money was paid over to Duvall in a few days thereafter, and that on the next day after the money was paid, Duvall told witness he had bought the note from Darby on him, McClelland, and others. To which testimony defendants objected. The court sustained the objection, and rejected the evidence; which was the second error assigned.</p>

W. Darby; that he wanted a little to make up the amount; that he had on hands about $850, and if the Doctor could let him have $50, he thought he could get the balance from another person. Witness told him that he had not the money by him; that he then left, and in a short time afterwards, Duvall told witness that he had raised the balance of the money and made the purchase; that witness then told him that he had better look sharp, that Darby was rather a doubtful man — that Duvall replied that the note was well secured, as he had Hugh McClelland for bail on it. To which testimony defendants objected. The court sustained the objection, and rejected the evidence; which was the third error assigned.</p>

Witness then asked him if he thought the note was good; he replied that it was good, for the name of Hugh McClelland was on it, and he was' good for the money. To which testimony defendants objected.

The allowance of the exception by the court below does not validate it. This court may still treat it as too late, and <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>disregard it. Had the court below treated the statement of the witness as a mere offer of testimony, and sealed a bill upon that basis, it might have been effectual — but that was not the case here.</p>
    <p id="b59-6" data-blocks='[["BL_59.6",59,[230,585,1169,475]]]'>Although the assignment of error based upon this exception might be disposed of by the foregoing remark, still we may add that the evidence was not objectionable on the ground taken. The witness uses “impression” and “recollection” as synonymous ; for he says, “ I can say my recollection is, the amount was not large.” This was a clear declaration of the fact from memory — and his superadded remark, “It is merely but an impression,” only expressed that his recollection was not distinct; for he further adds, “ My best belief from what was said, is, that the sum was not large.” He evidently uses the words “ recollection” and “impression” interchangeably.</p>

The recollection of the words is referred to as the ground of the impression. There is no room, therefore, to infer that the impression was from any other source than that referred to, viz., the words; in such a case it was evidence to go to the jury: 1 Greenleaf, § 440; Carmalt <em>v. </em>Post, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20411" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="8 Watts 411">8 Watts 411</a>; Smith’s Leading Cases 270.</p>

The declarations of the plaintiff’s intestate were not <em>res gestee. </em>They were made to strangers, and not in the transaction between him and Darby, one of the defendants. As the offer contravened a rule that a party cannot make evidence for himself, the court was right in rejecting it. None of the cases cited make the offer an exception to the rule.</p>
