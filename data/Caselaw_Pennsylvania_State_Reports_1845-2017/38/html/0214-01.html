This seems to have been the true issue before the jury. No doubt the proof of dissolution is complete; and thus the evidence of notice of it alone remains in dispute.</p>

Then what evidence is there of special notice to the plaintiff?- It is in the testimony of the plaintiff’s son. He says that Ilunsieker told his father that he was going to withdraw his name from the firm, that his money would remain in the firm as usual. This was submitted to the jury, but it was so equivocal that they found it to be no notice of dissolution. But it accounts for the fact that after that, the plaintiff’s charges are against Williamson &amp; Co., instead of Williamson, Ilunsieker &amp; Co., meaning the same men under a different firm name. The book entries were therefore admissible, and the change of their firm is accounted for.</p>
