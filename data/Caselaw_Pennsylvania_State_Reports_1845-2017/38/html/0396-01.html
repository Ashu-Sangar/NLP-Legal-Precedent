Is it proved that the property, the ownership of the sugars, became vested in White, Stevens &amp; Co. ? You will observe that at the time when the plaintiffs gave their promissory notes, and the defendants received them, if not before, the sellers had done all that the contract of sale required them to do, in order to perfect it. Nothing remained to be done to ascertain the quantity, the quality, or the price of the goods, or to designate the subject-matter, the sale, or the particular articles sold. If the sale had been of a part óf a larger quantity, as, for example, fifty hogsheads out of a hundred, or a hundred and ninety-five hogsheads, without describing what particular hogsheads, or anything had remained to be done to ascertain either the quantity or the price, the sale would have remained incomplete, and the ownership of the goods would not have passed to the buyers. But the price and quantity had been ascertained. The sugars had been weighed, and the agreement was to take them at that weight. The price had been defined, and notes were given and received for the amount. Nor was it a sale of part of a lot of goods. There was no uncertainty respecting the precise thing bought and sold. The particular goods were specified. They were the cargo of the <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>D. Gr. Wilson, and the hogsheads, tierces, and barrels were marked and identified in the contract by those marks.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b400-6" data-blocks='[["BL_400.6",400,[338,467,1159,226]]]'>“ íhe law is that when a bargain is struck, the terms of sale agreed upon, the property specified, and everything which the seller has to do with the goods is complete, the contract of sale becomes absolute without delivery, and the property vests in the buyer.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b400-7" data-blocks='[["BL_400.7",400,[336,690,1160,171]]]'>“ I am of opinion, therefore, gentlemen, that the title to the property passed to White, Stevens &amp; Co., under the contract of sale proved, and that delivery was not necessary to complete their ownership.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b400-8" data-blocks='[["BL_400.8",400,[335,859,1160,176]]]'>“ But it is not only necessary for the plaintiffs to make out that they became the owners of the goods by the contract of sale, but it must also be proved that they had a right to the possession at the time when the alleged conversion took place.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b400-9" data-blocks='[["BL_400.9",400,[332,1032,1160,344]]]'>“ Ordinarily, the ownership of personal property carries with it the right of possession, but it is not always so. Familiar illustrations of this abound; thus, a man may rent his household furniture to another. He is still the owner, but the tenant has the right of possession even against him. So if a man leaves his carriage with a carriage-maker, to be repaired, and the work is done, the carriage-maker has the right to hold possession until he is paid for his work.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b400-10" data-blocks='[["BL_400.10",400,[331,1373,1159,258]]]'>“ So if goods are sold for cash, or sold and nothing is said as to the time of delivery or payment, it is a cash sale. If the goods are specified, the quantity and price fixed, the title passes, the buyer becomes the owner; he has the right of property. If they are consumed by fire it is his loss, but he has no right to the possession. He cannot take the goods until he pays the price.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b400-11" data-blocks='[["BL_400.11",400,[324,1631,1165,775]],["BL_401.1",401,[219,400,1170,644]]]'>“ But if goods are sold on credit, and nothing is agreed upon as to the time of obtaining possession, the buyer is generally entitled to immediate possession. Then he has in most cases both the right of property and the right of possession. Yet his right to the possession is not indefeasible. If he becomes inr solvent before he obtains possession, his right to it is gone. The seller may then refuse to deliver to him the goods, and may hold on to them until the price is paid, until the whole debt is paid. I repeat, gentlemen, for this is an important principle, and has a material bearing upon this part of the case: If goods are sold on credit, but the purchaser suffer them to remain in possession of the seller, until the term of credit has expired, or until the purchaser becomes insolvent, the seller’s right to hold possession revives, and the buyer cannot claim to take the goods from him without first paying the price. This right of the seller grows out of his former ownership, and is allowed by the law on account of its obvious justice. When a buyer becomes insolvent before obtaining possession of property purchased, it is manifestly <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>inequitable that the seller’s goods should be applied to the payment of the general creditors of the purchaser, and the seller be left unpaid. Accordingly, while the possession remains with-the seller, he is not bound to give the goods up after the buyer has failed. This right of the seller is so favoured by the law, that even if he has parted with the possession, and delivered the goods to a carrier to be transmitted to the buyer, he may still stop them on their way and resume possession, if the buyer becomes insolvent before they reach their place of destination. There is at least equal reason for allowing him to hold on to the goods when he has never parted with their custody, or with the. control over them. Yet if the goods have been delivered, if the seller has parted with the possession, and the buyer has obtained, it, and then became insolvent, there is no right in the seller to take back the possession.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b401-6" data-blocks='[["BL_401.6",401,[218,1045,1169,214]]]'>
      <em>“ </em>Even if they subsequently come back to his custody, and under his control, his right to retain them is gone. There has been an interruption of his possession, which is fatal to his claim to hold the goods as security, merely on account of the insolvency of the purchaser.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b401-7" data-blocks='[["BL_401.7",401,[215,1260,1170,689]]]'>“ And, gentlemen, I hold, and so instruct you, that these principles are applicable to the present case. The defendants were, factors, and received these sugars to sell on commission. They-paid the freight, the duties, drayage, cooperage, and other expenses, and charged to their consignors, storage, insurance, and expenses severally, as well as percentage for guarantee. In answer to the drafts of the consignors they remitted the net price of the goods, and when the plaintiffs became insolvent they had paid, as the account current given in evidence shows, more than the entire value of the cargo of the D. G. Wilson. Without entering into the reasons why I think so, I give you as the law, that having sold the sugars on the 11th of July, and taken the notes of White, Stevens &amp; Co., payable in four months, when the purchasers became insolvent on the 80th of September, these, defendants had a- right to retain all the goods which had not: been delivered until they received the price unpaid.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b401-8" data-blocks='[["BL_401.8",401,[215,1949,1170,429]]]'>“ It therefore becomes very important to inquire whether there was such a delivery of those sugars which remained in the defendants’ stores, as is sufficient to defeat their right to hold, them, after White, Stevens &amp; Co. became insolvent. That the hogsheads were not removed until after the 30th of September is. not denied, but there might have been a delivery without a removal, a sufficient delivery to put an end to all right of the sellers to retain them, and the principal contest in this case has been, whether any of the facts proved would in law warrant you-in coming to the conclusion that such a delivery took place.</p>

Generally it may be said to be a handing over of the possession, a parting with it by the seller, and a taking it by the buyer. It is not a handing over of the title or ownership, bat of the present enjoyment. It is the giving up the control of the goods which takes away the right of the vendor to retain after the vendee becomes insolvent.</p>

There is then nothing for the jury to pass upon.</p>

I propose to call your attention to each of these, and inquire whether in law any one or all combined furnishes any evidence that the sugars remaining in the stores had been delivered before the 30th of September 1857 — so delivered as to- interrupt the defendants’ possession, and destroy their right -to retain.</p>

Welsh the warehousemen of the plaintiffs, and therefore passed the possession to the plaintiffs. There is no evidence of any express arrangement between the parties respecting storage, other than that contained in the bought note. None whatever that they were or were not to pay storage after the expiration of the first month. It may be presumed that the Messrs. Welsh would have charged it, if the sugars had been taken away after the month, but there was no express contract to that effect. If there had been, and the agreement had gone farther and provided that, after the first month the Welshes should hold the goods as the warehousemen of the plaintiffs, then the possession of the Welshes under such an agreement would have been the possession of the plaintiffs, and there would have been evidence of a delivery. But there is no such proof, and the question therefore is, what was the effect of the provision in the contract as proved upon the goods in the store ? It merely relieved the buyers from paying storage up to August 9th. Or, if it be considered that the storage Avas a part of the consideration of their purchase, and that they paid storage during the first month, it makes no difference in my judgment. If it Ayas a <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>charge of storage, then it was for a time commencing before the plaintiffs had any right to the delivery of the goods, for their notes were not given until July 29th. It was, consequently, no acknowledgment of delivery. But, apart from this, the rule of law is that a mere charge of storage, even if it is paid, is no evidence that goods sold on credit, and remaining in the store of a vendor, have been delivered, so as to defeat his right to retain them, if the vendee becomes insolvent.</p>

Andrews &amp; Morris obtained some, and White, Hart &amp; Co., others. These removals were made on the 26th and 28th August, and on the 7th of September. After the plaintiffs had given their notes, undoubtedly the hogsheads and tierces thus taken away were delivered, and were no longer liable to be retained by the defendants, even if they had again come into their possession. But did the removal of these lots, with the consent of the defendants, constitute an absolute delivery of those which were not taken away, but which remained in the stores until after the failure of White, Stevens &amp; Co.? For the contest here is in regard to the remaining sugars. The rule of law is, that a delivery of a portion of goods included in a contract of sale, is a delivery of the whole only when the delivery of such portion is in the name or place of -the whole, and is intended to be a delivery of the whole. ■ Therefore, the removal of the.portions of these sugars which were taken from the warehouse of the defendants, by the directions of Field &amp; <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>Keehmle, and. at the instance of the plaintiffs after the sale- to them, was not of itself more than a delivery of the particular goods taken away. It did not necessarily disturb the possession of the sellers as to those not removed, or take away their right to hold on to them until the price was paid. To give to the delivery of the portions taken away such an effect, to make it a delivery of the whole, it is necessary that it should have been proved that they were delivered in the name of the whole, and with the intention that in giving up the possession of those hogsheads they- were giving up the possession of the whole. Nor did the giving up a part to the purchasers of White, Stevens &amp; Co.become a delivery of the remainder, because Messrs. Samuel &amp; William Welsh did not avow; or express an intention to retain the rest. Had the plaintiffs, after the sale to them, or had their agents sent an order to the defendants for- the delivery of the' whole cargo bought, or of all which remained undelivered, and had a portion of the goods been delivered under that order, a-very different question would have been presented. There the delivery of the portion would have been in the name of the whole. But the orders- here were entirely different. They were not orders for- the whole. They were orders for portions. The-deliveries- were upon the orders, and were therefore deliveries of portions. In such a case, the law does not. presume that the delivery of such portion is a delivery of the whole. You would not, therefore, be. warranted by the facts that' White, Stevens &amp; Co. sold parcels of these sugars to White, Hart &amp; Co. and to Andrews &amp; Morris, and that these purchasers removed the parcels sold to' them from the defendants’ warehouse, before the' insolvency of the plaintiffs — I say that you would not be warranted in finding that the remainder of the sugars' not removed-were delivered, so as to bar the defendants’ right to retain them-until the price was paid.</p>

I do not think so; Even if the samples which Field &amp; Keehmle first had,, were at the sale placed in the possession of White, Stevens &amp; Co;,it was not for the purpose- of delivery. Field &amp; Keehmle were-mere merchandise brokers. Their power was- to make the contract of sale for- their principals. They- had no power to deliver the goods* And,, besides, at that time, the plaintiffs' were not. entitled to have delivery made. They had bought on credit; and, by the terms of sale, as- evidenced in the bill of parcels1 delivered to them, they- were to give their notes* at four months, before they would- be entitled to the possession. These notes" were not given until' the 29th of July. Until that day, there<a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>fore, they had no right to the possession. The samples, if they obtained them at all, were obtained on the 11th of the month, eighteen days previous.

This proposition assumes that the act of resampling by the agents of the plaintiffs, with the knowledge and consent of the defendants, has been proved. The only evidence on this subject is to be found in the testimony of Samuel Field. He testifies : 4 We had occasion to send samples of these sugars to New York, in September, for White, Stevens &amp; Go.; I can’t say whether they were fresh samples, but my impression is that they were ’fresh; our sampler, I presume, took them.; I can’t say; I have no knowledge upon the subject.’ Having no personal knowledge upon the subject, of course his testimony cannot prove that fresh samples were taken. But, even if they were, no delivery orders had been given, as had been for all the casks actually delivered and removed. And it does not appear that they were taken by plaintiffs’ orders, nor is there anything to show that the act was intended to be a taking of the possession. Had the samples been taken by White, Stevens &amp; Co., after they gave their notes for the purchase-money, or by any one authorized by them to receive delivery, a different question would have arisen.</p>

But the circumstances in this case are widely different. There is no proof that Field &amp; Keehmle were authorized to receive delivery. They were the merchandise brokers of the plaintiffs, their agents to make contracts of sale, and then draw orders for the delivery to the purchasers. Their taking samples under these circumstances, is no evidence of a delivery of the goods to White, Stevens &amp; Co., under the contract of sale to them.</p>

Andrews &amp; Morris obtained some, and White, Hart &amp; Co., others. These removals were made on the 26th and 28th August, and on the 7th of November. After the plaintiffs had given their notes, undoubtedly the hogsheads and tierces thus taken away were delivered, and were no longer liable to be retained by the defendants, even if they had again come into their possession. But did the removal of these <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>lots, with, the consent of the defendants, constitute an absolute delivery of those which were not taken away, but which remained in the stores until after the failure of White, Stevens &amp; Co. ? For the contest here is in regard to the remaining sugars. The rule of law is, that a delivery of a portion of goods sold is a delivery of the whole, only when the delivery of such portion is in the name and place of the whole, and is intended to be a delivery of the whole. Therefore the removal of the portions of these sugars which were -taken from the warehouse of the defendants, by the direction of Field &amp; Keehmle, and at the instance of the plaintiffs, after the sale to them, was not of itself more than a delivery of the particular goods taken away. It did not necessarily disturb the possession of the sellers as to those not removed, or take away their right to hold on to them until the price was -paid. To give to the delivery of the portion taken away such an effect, — to make it a delivery of the whole, —it is necessary that it should have been proved that they were delivered in the name of the whole, and with the intention that in giving up the possession of these hogsheads they were giving up the possession of the whole. Nor did the giving up a part to the purchasers of White, Stevens <em>&amp; Go., </em>become a delivery of the remainder, because Messrs. Samuel &amp; William Welsh did not avow or express an intention to retain the rest. Had the plaintiffs, after the sale to them, or had their agents sent an order to the defendants for the delivery of the whole cargo bought, or of all which remained undelivered, and had a portion of the goods been delivered under that order, a very different question would have been presented. There the delivery of the portion would have been in the name of the whole. But the orders have been entirely different. They were not orders for the whole. They were orders for portions. The deliveries were made upon the orders, and were therefore deliveries of portions. In such a case the law does not presume that the delivery of such portion is a delivery of the whole. You would not, there? fore, be warranted by the facts that White, Stevens &amp; Co. sold parcels of these sugars to White, Hart &amp; Co., and to Andrews &amp; Morris, and that these purchasers removed the parcels sold to them from the defendants’ warehouse, before the insolvency of the plaintiffs — I say that you would not be warranted in finding that the remainder of the sugars not removed were delivered, so as to bar the defendants’ right to retain them until the price was paid.”</p>

Even if the samples which Field &amp; Keehmle first had were at the sale placed in the possession of White, Stevens &amp; Co., it was not for the purpose of delivery. Field &amp; Keehmle were mere merchandise brokers. Their power was to make the contract of sale for their principals. They had no power to deliver the goods. And besides, at that time the plaintiffs were not entitled to have delivery made. They had bought on credit, and, by the terms-of sale, as evidenced in the bill of parcels delivered to them, they were to give their notes, at four months, before they would be entitled to the possession. These notes were not given until the 29th of July. Until that day, therefore, they had no right to the possession. The samples, if they obtained them at all, were obtained on the 11th of the month, eighteen days previous.

This proposition assumes that the act of resampling by the agents of the plaintiffs, with the knowledge and consent of the defendants, has been proved. The only evidence on this subject is to be found in the testimony of Samuel Field. He testifies: ‘We had occasion to send samples of these sugars to New York, in September, for White, Stevens &amp; Co.; I don’t say whether they were fresh samples, but my impression, is that they were fresh.; our sampler, I presume, took them; I can’t say; I have no knowledge upon the subject.’ Having no personal knowledge upon the subject, of course his testimony cannot prove that fresh samples were taken. But even if they were, no delivery orders had been given, as had been for all the casks actually delivered and removed. And it does not appear that they were taken by plaintiffs’ orders; nor is there anything to show that the act. was intended to be a taking of the possession.

If goods are sold <em>upon credit, </em>and nothing is agreed upon as to the time of delivery, the vendee is immediately entitled to the possession, and the right of possession and the right of property vests at once in him; but his right of possession is not absolute; it is liable to be defeated <em>if he becomes insolvent before he obtains possession.</em>

If a vendor has a right to stop <em>in </em>transitu, <em>a fortiori </em>he has a right of retainer before any transit has commenced.</p>
    <p id="b420-10" data-blocks='[["BL_420.14",420,[324,1407,1165,688]]]'>It is by the equity of the law that this right .is allowed, in order to save an unpaid vendor, as late as possible, from an irrevocable completion of the contract on his part, when by the unexpected insolvency of the vendee, a completion on his part has become improbable. The rule is, that so long as the vendor has the actual possession of the goods or as they are in the custody of his agents, and while they are in transit from him to the vendee, he has a right to refuse or countermand the final delivery, if the vendee be in failing circumstances. <em>The </em>authorities cited by defendants’ counsel fully sustain this statement of the rule and, we need not discuss them. We find most of them very well summed up also in Bateman on Commercial Law, §§ 253, 266, just published. We may add the case of Winslow <em>v. </em>Leonard, 12 Harris 14, wherein some distinctions are pointed out, which set aside as irrelevant most of the authorities that were cited by the plaintiffs’ counsel.</p>

But, taking the law as we have stated it, all the rejected evidence appears to be entirely unimportant: for the undisputed fact remains, that the goods over which the right of retention was asserted, had not been removed after the <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>sale, but still continued, until the • plaintiffs’ insolvency, in the stores and custody of the defendants. This fact itself preserves to the defendants their lien and right of retention for unpaid purchase-money, on the failure of the plaintiffs, where no right of third persons has intervened, as there has not here. There is nothing like an estoppel of their right of retention.</p>

But we are constrained to say that that opinion exhibits a great confusion of principles and an entire misapprehension of many of the cases cited in support of it, and that we cannot regard it as a true declaration of the law of the case. The question was of the right of retainer or stoppage <em>in transitu; </em>and yet some of the cases cited relate only to the question of the validity of the contract under the Statute of Frauds (1 Taunt. 458; 3 B. &amp; A. 321; 1 Camp. 513; <a href="/mass/18/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Pick. 476" data-case-ids="2070887" data-case-paths="/mass/18/0483-01">1 Pick. 476</a>), and some to the question of the completeness of the contract, so as to pass the title to the risk (11 East 211; 6 Id. 214; 4 Taunt. 644; 5 Id. 176; 2 M. &amp; S. 397; <a href="/mass/10/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="10 Mass. 308" data-case-ids="2026945,2026965" data-case-paths="/mass/10/0307-01,/mass/10/0301-01">10 Mass. 308</a>). Some of them do relate to the rights of retainer and stoppage, and decide that the right is gone where the goods are in the hands of a third person, and the vendee has obtained the control of them by a delivery order: 12 East 614; 4 B. &amp; P. 69; 7 Taunt. 278; 4 Camp. 251. Or where the vendor has assented to a sale by the vendee to a third person: 14 East 308; 1 Starkie 447 ; <a href="/cai/2/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2 Cai. Cas. 38" data-case-ids="6689984" data-case-paths="/cai/2/0038-01">2 Caines 38</a>. The only other one relates to the termination of the transit. Not one of the cases supports the judgment given by the learned judge. These questions are all distinguished in Winslow <em>v. </em>Leonard, 12 Harris 14; and thus we may be saved from such confusion hereafter.</p>
