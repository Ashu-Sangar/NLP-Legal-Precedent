Peters, Jr., who was living with his father at the time of his death. Objection being made by some of the children, the administratrix, with their consent, agreed with James to submit the question of ownership to Mr. Lewis, her counsel, who, on hearing a number of witnesses, decided that the horse belonged to James. The horse was accordingly delivered to James, and credit asked by the administratrix for the appraised value.</p>

To his report the testimony bearing upon the question of ownership was appended. Exceptions were filed to this report by Mrs. Peters, alleging error in charging her with the value of the horse, in deciding that the question of ownership was not finally decided by Mr. Lewis, and in deciding the question of fact as to the ownership of the horse.</p>
