Dehaven, from a decree of the Common Pleas of Philadelphia, dismissing their exceptions to the report of the auditor appointed to distribute the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale of the real estate of William Dehaven, which was sold on a <em>levari facias </em>at the suit of the city of Philadelphia, and refusing to award an issue to try the question of ownership of the premises at the time of sale.</p>

By-Henry W. Gault, as sole owner of the premises under a sheriff’s sale on a municipal claim, made May 1st 1854. His deed was duly executed and acknowledged by the sheriff on the 13th of May 1854, and recorded in the District Court of the city and county of Philadelphia; 2. By George and Jacob B. Dehaven, as-joint owners under a sheriff’s sale made November 10th 1856, under a claim for registered taxes filed in the District Court. Their deed was not acknowledged or recorded in the District Court from which the process issued, although a certificate of acknowledgment appeared on the instrument; but the <em>levari facias </em>upon which the sale was made was duly returned by the sheriff, showing the sale of the premises therein described to George Dehaven and Jacob B. Dehaven, as above stated. The minute-book of the Common Pleas showed that their deed was acknowledged in that court November 10th 1856, and in fact was recorded there, notwithstanding the certificate in the deed refers to a deed-book in the District Court.</p>

Dehaven applied to the Court of Common Pleas in due form, for an issue to try the facts in dispute, setting them forth in detail. They also filed exceptions to the report, whereupon the auditor proceeded to re-examine the case, and reported that the exceptions were not well founded; and as to the demand for an issue, he refused to allow it, because the facts alleged to be in dispute were not so in point of truth, but were conclusive against the exceptants.</p>

Under these circumstances he decided that the deed passed no title to the purchasers. If this decision be right, then Gault’s title was without any competitor for the money, and the appellants without any status in court.</p>
    <p id="b375-9" data-blocks='[["BL_375.13",375,[258,1137,1166,523]]]'>The Act of June 16th 1836’is explicit in regard to the jurisdiction of courts in taking acknowledgments of sheriffs’ deeds. It provides, first, for sales on execution from the Supreme Court. There the deed may be acknowledged in banc or before one of the judges sitting at Nisi Prius; or, intending doubtless to provide for vacations in these courts, the acknowledgment may in certain cases be either in the District Court or Court of Common Pleas where the land lies. So, in sales made on <em>testatum </em>process, they may be acknowledged in the courts of the county where the sale takes place. “In all other cases,” says the act, “ the acknowledgment aforesaid shall be made in the court from which the execution issues Brightly’s Purdon 345.</p>
    <p id="b375-10" data-blocks='[["BL_375.14",375,[247,1659,1171,775]],["BL_376.1",376,[311,400,1160,342]]]'>These provisions were taken mainly from the Acts of 1705 and 1791: 1 Sm. Laws 57; 3 <a href="/watts/10/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="10 Watts 13" data-case-ids="1851011" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0013-01">Id. 28</a>. The last provision quoted, conformed the legislation to the decision of this court in McCormick <em>v. </em>Meason, 1 S. &amp; R. 92, upon the 4th section of the Act of 1705, in which it was held that the acknowledgment of a deed in the Common Pleas of Westmoreland county was void, the <em>vend. exp. </em>having issued out of the Common Pleas of Fayetto county. The regulations on this subject are too important and material to be departed from. The acknowledgment is a judicial act, and concludes many questions of regularity in the execution of the process. With no propriety could this be held to be law, if the court taking the acknowledgment has no power to supervise the process or set it aside for irregularity, and this would be the case where the process did not issue in the court wherein the acknowledgment was made. Again, as the entry of the acknowledgment is equivalent to recording the deed, it would create great confusion if the records of the court in which the sale was made might not be referred to as containing all the evidence of <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>the sale. But the language of the Act of 1836, as quoted, is an emphatic direction on the point under consideration, and must be followed. The proposed issue, even if in time, which we do not say was the case, did not embrace any question about the fact that the deed was acknowledged in the Common Pleas, and that the process issued from the District Court. We think, therefore, that the auditor was right in holding that De Haven’s deed was invalid, and in awarding the money to Gault.</p>
