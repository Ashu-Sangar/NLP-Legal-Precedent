Some time during the same year Neely agreed to sell John L. Reed one end of this tract, containing about 116 acres, under which agreement Reed paid $5, and went into possession, built a house and stable on it, cleared a portion of the land, and is still in possession.</p>

An arrangement was at length made in 1848, under which Reed cancelled his contract with Neely, and gave one to plaintiff for the 116 acres, under a parol promise by them that they would give him a deed for the ten acres on which his improvements had been made, as soon as they had obtained one from their vendor. Reed remained in possession of the ten acres, and in 1849 accepted an article of agreement from Plumer &amp; Crary for twelve acres more of the same tract, but without saying anything of the piece occupied by him.</p>

If the jury had been satisfied from the evidence, that the plaintiffs induced Reed to surrender his article of agreement, and to facilitate their acquisition of title to the whole tract, by promising him a conveyance of the ten acres now in dispute, a trust <em>ex maleficio </em>would arise in his favour as to the ten acres-.

He still held an equitable interest, coupled with the actual possession. He had an estate in the land. Plumer &amp; Crary were iron-masters, and wanted the wood on the land for their furnace, and very likely preferred to extinguish Reed’s equities speedily by inducing him to surrender them, rather than buy in the paramount title, and wait for the slow results of the law. Did they extinguish them by the promise of the ten acres ? That is the question of fact in the case; for if they did, it would be highly inequitable in them to turn Reed out of the possession of these very acres. Reed was entitled' to have the legal title on complying with his contract, and if he surrendered his position to the <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>plaintiffs on the terms alleged, it was a valuable consideration for their agreement, and their action brought in disregard of their promise ought not to be sustained.</p>

If Reed have not paid for the 12 acres according to his contract, the plaintiffs have a right to turn him out of that part; but the 10 acres he would have the right to hold, if the jury should find the facts alleged.</p>
