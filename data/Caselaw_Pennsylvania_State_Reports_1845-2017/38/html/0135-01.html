The case was this: Broomhall, being the endorser and holder of a promissory note drawn by Henry E. Peirce to the order of John L. Pennell, for $225, at sixty days, deposited it, on or about the 1st of January 1858, in the bank for collection.</p>

Tho date as altered was imperfect and obscure, and was, after a careful examination, read by the bank officers “December 5th 1857,” marked as maturing February 6th 1858, on which day it was, in due form of law, protested for non-payment, of which the parties had notic-e.</p>

If the jury believe that the plaintiff received notice of the protest at or about the time, then as the true maturity was ten days after, it was the duty of the plaintiff to inform the defendant of the error, and his not doing so was such negligence on the part of the plaintiff as wholly relieves the defendant from liability.</p>

There can be no doubt that the 15th is there, for anybody can see it who looks, and the court could commit no error in saying that much. But the first figure was not so strongly marked as the other, and therefore the bank’s officers <em>interpreted it out </em>rather than overlooked it, and thus made a mistake and had the note presented for payment ten days too soon, and not at the proper time, and thus discharged the endorser. This was clear carelessness; for, if there was any doubt about the date, the bank ought to have refused the collection of it, or to have got the holder to state what was the true date, or to have presented it on both days. To guess a meaning contrary to the expression, is not careful. These views answer the first, second, and third assignments of error. The other is entitled to no special answer, because it contains nothing in itself, and because by reference it contains four points, instead of one. But it is answered in what we have said.</p>
