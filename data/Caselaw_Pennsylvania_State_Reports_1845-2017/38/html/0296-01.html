Barbier and George Bartolett, owners, and Elizabeth Leeds, executrix of Ezra B. Leeds, contractor. . The claim, which was in proper form and filed in due time, was for lime and other materials used in the buildings by Leeds the contractor, amounting to $93.21. The bill attached to the claim was against “ the estate of Ezra B. <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>Leeds, for lime, &amp;c., furnished to Bartolett’s new stores adjoining railroad depot in Germantown.” The lien claim was filed against “ George H. Barbier and George -Bartolett, owners or reputed owners, and Elizabeth Leeds, executrix of Ezra B. Leeds, deceased, who was the contractor,” describing the buildings and curtilage.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b297-7" data-blocks='[["BL_297.7",297,[255,833,1178,475]]]'>On the trial, the plaintiff’s book of original entries was offered in evidence, in which the charges were made against “ George Barbier, for new building next to depot on Main street.”The evidence was objected to because of the variance between it and the lien charges; but the court overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence under exception. The plaintiff then' proved the delivery of the materials to the buildings; that Leeds was the contractor; that Barbier had ordered some of the materials ; that Bartolett had bought an interest in the buildings, and that Bartolett, in settling with Leeds, had retained $82.98, to pay Smith’s bill.</p>

The ground of objection is that the book charged the materials to the owner of the building instead of the contractor.</p>
    <p id="b298-10" data-blocks='[["BL_298.12",298,[299,1001,1171,520]]]'>The statute does not prescribe the manner of proof in such cases, and therefore general rules and principles apply. The thing to be proved is that the materials or labour were furnished for and went into the building in question. A book of original entries, in connection with other explanatory evidence such as was here, is entirely competent. The book proved a sale and delivery of the articles to the owner of the building; the other evidence tended to prove that the contractor used them, and that in a settlement between the owner and the contractor, the money was set apart to pay the plaintiff’s bill. . Unexplained, the book charges would not of themselves have sustained the lien; but accompanied with the other proofs, they were competent.</p>
