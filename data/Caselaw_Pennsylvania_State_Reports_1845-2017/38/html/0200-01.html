      <em>Qd. . </em>On the 8th February 1806, an adjoining lot was conveyed to the same persons on the same trust, for the consideration of ¿640. A school-house was erected on the property by the joint and equal contributions of the residents of Chestnut Hill and Springfield township, and a school was kept up in it for many years. In 1857, the school having been discontinued, the property was sold under the Real Estate Act of 1853, and the trustees filed their account in the Common Pleas, charging themselves with the proceeds of sale. Two parties claimed the fund, viz. :</p>

It was admitted that the school-house itself was of little or no value, but the land had increased in value, and was the real source of the fund.</p>

For that neighbourhood, therefore, the half of the fund which has not gone to Springfield must be preserved. And the trustees under the deed, 'or such successors as the Common Pleas may appoint, are the proper parties to preserve it. The city of Philadelphia has nothing to do with the fund. We doubt their capacity to act as trustee in respect of it.
