Shull did not pay it. Accordingly the executors of Stephens brought an action of covenant, No. 16, February Term 1859, against Shull, to enforce payment. The deed tendered was filed with the case. The executors and defendant then entered into an amicable arbitration to settle and determine the cause. The arbitrators to whom the cause was referred, on the 18th of February 1854, awarded in favour of the plaintiffs $971.</p>

The plaintiff then gave notice that the defendant might retain it at the valuation. This was accepted. He retained the possession, and paid the semi-annual instalments, or nearly so, up to the sale. At the time of the sale the balance on this judgment was $650. On the 7th of January 1857, E. Chalfant entered a judgment against Isaac Shull. On the 2lst of February 1857, J. 0. Flenniken, Esq., also entered a judgment against him. On the 7th of March 1857, Isaac Shull and wife, by deed, conveyed the property to John B. Gordon. On the 28th of February 1859, a <em>scire facias </em>issued to revive this judgment, No. 178, March Term 1859, with notice to John B. Gordon, terre-tenant. The issuing of this <em>scire facias </em>had not been noted on the judgment docket at the date of the sheriff’s sale. After Shull had made his deed to Gordon, several judgments were entered against Gordon, and amongst others, one in favour of “E. Chalfant &amp; Son” No. 124, December Term 1858, for $213.98; upon this judgment the property was levied on and sold for $1500. On the 15th of June 1859, the court appointed an auditor to distribute the fund, who reported that the judgment in favour of Stephens’s executors had lost its lien, and that, therefore, he appropriated the fund to the junior liens in their order. To this report the executors of Stephens excepted. But the court, on the 28th December 1859, overruled the exception <a id="p11" href="#p11" data-label="11" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*11</a>and confirmed the report; from which decree the executors of Stephens took this appeal, assigning for error here, that the court below erred in not appropriating so much of the fund in court as would pay the balance of the judgment of Stephens’s Executors <em>v. </em>Isaac Shull, and in confirming the auditor’s report.</p>

A sale under another judgment should have the same effect, for neither vendor, vendee, nor creditors could be injured by it. The claim here is made not so much because of the lien of the judgment as in virtue of the lien for purchase-money. The estate both of Shull and Gordon were sold according to the auditor’s distribution. The lien of the judgment and the lien for purchase-money are distinct things; the former is merely a remedy for enforcing the latter.

    <p id="b15-7" data-blocks='[["BL_15.6",15,[207,897,1167,389]]]'>It was not claimed that the lien of the execution held it because issued and seizure made before any of the subsequent judgments were entered, so' as to bring it within the principles alluded to in Packer’s Appeal, 6 Barr 277. Nor could it. have been, for the reason that when the execution issued the judgment was a lien as between the debtor and creditor, and, as was said in Jameson’s Appeal, Id. 280, “A judgment and an execution thereon have not, under our Acts of Assembly, distinct and independent liens upon the same land,”</p>
    <p id="b15-8" data-blocks='[["BL_15.7",15,[204,1287,1166,214]]]'>The question recurs, then, did the seizure and extent continue the lien, after that of the judgment was gone, it having been made while the judgment was a lien between the parties to it ? I think the doctrine of the last-mentioned case and the Act of 1827 will go far to settle this point.</p>
    <p id="b15-9" data-blocks='[["BL_15.8",15,[204,1501,1165,433]]]'>The execution and seizure had no lien independently of the judgment. That is the principle of the case just cited. The Act of 1827 provides that <em>“ </em>the lien of a judgment shall not be continued beyond five years, notwithstanding an execution may be issued thereon;” and “that no order or rule of court, or any other process or 'proceeding thereon, shall have the effect of obviating the necessity of the renewal in manner herein prescribed, of any judgment whatever.” Now apply these doctrines and enactments to the case in hand, and it seems to me but little difficulty exists in the case on this point.</p>

On this judgment to No. 51 of May Term 1854 a <em>fi. fa. </em>issued, and the land of Shull was levied and inquisition held, and the property extended at the yearly rental of $193. The possession was retained by the defendant under the appraisal, and the rents were paid to the appellants by him until he sold and conveyed to Gordon on the 7th of March 1857. On the 7th of Ja»e- 1857, Chalfant obtained a judgment against Shull for $149.61, and on the 21st of February following, J. 0. Flenniken also obtained judgment <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>against Mm for $114.24. Those judgments were all liens when Shull sold to Gordon.</p>

Chalfant &amp; Son, to December Term 1858, for $213.98, and upon it the property from which the fund comes was sold for $1500, and the money brought into court for distribution; and from the decree comes this appeal.</p>
    <p id="b16-7" data-blocks='[["BL_16.6",16,[309,729,1163,636]]]'>We think the auditor was right in refusing to distribute as claimed by the appellants — their judgment not being entered in the lien docket, and nothing shown which would give effect to it as against the subsequent judgments. Notwithstanding this defect, it was rightly decided that it was not a lien and not entitled. It was a question of lien on distribution; and, as that did not exist in the case, the right to claim the proceeds against the other judgments did not exist. The extent did not, <em>proprio vigore, </em>extend the lien, or, what is more to the point, did not dispense with the evidence of it — in fact, the existence of it. To give it such efficacy, would be to overthrow the lien docket altogether ; for the exceptions to the requirement that the judgment should appear there, would be as numerous as the cases of extent are frequent. Without taking up more time in the discussion, we affirm the decree of the court below.</p>
