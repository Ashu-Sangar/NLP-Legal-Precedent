Behind this yard there is a small storehouse extending entirely across the lot and about sixteen feet in depth. Behind this there is another storehouse, fifty feet in depth, on the north side, extending to the line of the adjoining property, while on the south there is a paved yard between it and lot No. 2, of about eight feet in width; on the rear end of the lot there is a stable about forty feet in depth, extending across the lot of both plaintiff and defendant. In 1845, before the giving of the mortgages under which the defendant in error claims, these buildings stood in the same position .as they do now, with the exception of the stable on the rear end of the lot, which had not then been erected.

This alley was used for all three of the lots. The buildings on the lot of the plaintiffs in error, with the exception of the stores on the front, had no outlet except over this alley, and it had been used in common with the other lots for many years. Dannaker himself used one of them for some time as a workshop.</p>
