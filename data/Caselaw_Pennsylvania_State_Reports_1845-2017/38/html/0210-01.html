    <p class="summary" id="b210-11" data-blocks='[["BL_210.11",210,[312,1333,1155,641]]]'>Francis Shelly held a judgment against Aaron F. Shelly for $3500, which was a lien on a house and two lots of land, belonging to Aaron, in Milford township. Subsequently John Sheetz obtained a judgment against Aaron F. Shelly for $1380, which bound the same property. On this last judgment an execution was taken out, and the real estate sold for $3050, the whole of which was claimed by Francis Shelly on account of his judgment. The sheriff claimed to deduct $63.37 as his costs on the writs of execution, and refused to pay more than the balance, after deducting this sum. It was received by Mr. Shelly under protest, who ruled the $63.37 into court for distribution. The court, without delivering any opinion, decreed the money to be paid, first to the costs of the sheriff on the sale proceedings, and the balance if any to Francis Shelly on his judgment; from which decree this appeal was taken.</p>

The record showed the previous lien, and if he chose to try an experiment it was at his own risk, or the chance of afterwards collecting the costs of the defendant. The appellant had a vested right which this sale and decree interfered with. The value of his vested interest could only be diminished by himself, as by a sale of the property on his own execution, when the costs must be taken out of the fund. Subser quent lien-creditors take their liens subject to the costs liable to <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>be made by a sale on a previous lien. A prior lien-creditor cannot be justly subjected to costs made on an after acquired lien. This question does not appear to have been decided in this state, but the almost uniform practice is believed to have been in accordance with the views here stated.</p>

And it seems to us a very just practice. Even the senior lien could not have been enforced without the same costs, and it has no right to expect a junior one to await its enforcement. They have a right to insist upon a sale in order to learn whether the net proceeds of the sale will reach them, and then to seek satisfaction otherwise, if it does not. On the same principle, the expense of an audit in distributing the fund is always paid out of the fund, whether the lien on which the sale was had is reached by the proceeds or not.</p>
