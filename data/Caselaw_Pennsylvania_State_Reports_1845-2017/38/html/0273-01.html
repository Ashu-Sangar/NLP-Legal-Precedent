It should have set forth that he charged <em>“ </em>other fees than those allowed by the fee-bill,” so that he might have known his true position.

It was long ago determined that such a demand was within the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace: Prior <em>v. </em>Craig, 5 S. &amp; R. 44. There have been many cases since, begun in the same way and sustained; the last of which in our books is Simmonds <em>v. </em>Kelly, 9 Casey 190.</p>

This was explicit notice enough, there being no fee allowed for such ser<a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>vice in tbe cases in which it was alleged to have been charged and received by him.</p>

      <em>We </em>think the endorsement of the place of abode of the attorney, stating himself attorney, was equivalent to an endorsement that he was the plaintiff’s agent, authorized to receive amends. This is implied in the nature of his office.</p>

The meaning of the statute, if plain, is to be followed, notwithstanding, as in any other case. The remedy for the recovery, if not a special one, is to be pursued just in the same manner as in other cases to which it is applicable. In this case the action is debt, and it is to be proceeded in, so far as the action is concerned, just as in any other action of debt.
