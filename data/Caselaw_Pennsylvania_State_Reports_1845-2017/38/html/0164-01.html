    <p class="summary" id="b164-9" data-blocks='[["BL_164.8",164,[300,887,1164,560]]]'>This was an appeal by Lewis Yastine, from the decree of the court below, reversing the report of the auditor appointed by the court to distribute the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale of the personal property in and about a certain spike or nail forge of Nathan L. and Thomas J. Attwood. The contest was between the execution-creditors and certain mechanics and labourers employed by the Messrs. Attwood at this forge, who claimed a preference by virtue of the 3d section of the Act of April 2d, 1849, entitled “ An Act for the protection of miners, mechanics and labourers.” The facts of the case were not disputed. The auditor, under the authority of Wood’s Appeal, 6 Casey 274, rejected the claims of the mechanics and labourers, and distributed the mon.ey to the execution-creditor.</p>

The section is badly expressed, It provides no mode of ascertaining the just claims of labourers, while it requires the officer to pay them out of the proceeds of the sale, <em>“the amount each is justly and legally entitled to </em>receive,” not exceeding $50, “ <em>in like manner as rents are now payable in such cases.” </em>Notwithstanding the difficulty of interpreting and executing a law couched in such obscure phraseology, we think the legislature meant to give such claims as labourers should set up, not exceeding $50, a preference over the rights of execution-creditors, where the money for distribution arises from sale of personal property. Unless this were intended we cannot see what possible effect the enactment could have. The personalty earn be converted into money by creditors only by an execution salé, and if on distribution of the proceeds, they may exclude the labourers, the act is nugatory, for the creditors are forbidden by law to raise more money than is sufficient to pay themselves. The creditors have no lien on the personalty before they take execution, and when their executions go into the sheriff’s hands the lien they acquire is a common law and not a statutory lien. Whilst we do not in general allow statutes to be repealed by implication, and refused in Wade’s Appeal, 5 Casey 328, to give labourers a preference in distribution of the proceeds of. real estate over judgment-creditors whose liens vested by statute, nothing is more common than for a rule of the common law to give way before an inconsistent statute. And we think the legislature meant, in this- instance, to postpone the common law lien of the execution-creditor to the claims of the labourers. In Reed’s Appeal, 6 Harris 235, this preference of labourers was recognised as extending to the personal estate generally of the employer. In Wood’s Appeal, 6 Casey 279, it was denied as against a landlord’s statutory right to a year’s rent, on the same <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>ground that was assumed in the previous case of Wade’s Appeal; at least the ruling in Wood’s Appeal can be justified on that ground.</p>
    <p id="b166-6" data-blocks='[["BL_166.6",166,[315,547,1165,214]]]'>But here the creditors stand on no statutory lien. If they did, we should require express evidence of the legislative intention to repeal the statute giving the lien. They have nothing to urge but their common law rights, and these must yield to the statutory rights of the labourers.</p>
