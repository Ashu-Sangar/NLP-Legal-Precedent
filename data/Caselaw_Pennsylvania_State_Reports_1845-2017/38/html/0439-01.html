    <p id="b444-8" data-blocks='[["BL_444.12",444,[306,1016,1165,1059]]]'>First, as to the legitimacy of George. The putative father, August Ehlers, was married to the admitted'mother, Mary Rupp, on the 4th March 1835. What time George was born was disputed in the evidence. The testimony of Moses Strouse tended to fix the date of his birth as early as September — that of Mrs. Theresa Ritz as late as December ensuing the marriage — but Mrs. Ehlers, the mother, swore that he was born on the 28th November 1835. This would be but six days short of nine months from the marriage, and if believed by the jury, would be competent time. But there was some evidence, though of a very unsatisfactory nature, that Mrs. Ehlers was pregnant when she was married. The learned judge submitted all the evidence to the jury, with instructions, that if George was born in November, there would be no doubt of his legitimacy, but that if the mother was pregnant when married, and the child was born at tlm time testified by Moses Strouse, the jury were then to decide, whether the' evidence plainly shows the non-access of the husband before the marriage. He added, that the law presumes a child born after marriage to be the child of the husband; that it presumes, also, that where the child is begotten before but born after marriage, the husband is the father; that where the parents might have had sexual intercourse, access is to be presumed, and that these legal presumptions must be rebutted by evidence, plainly showing non-access by the husband, so that he could not in the order of nature be the father of the child.</p>

In consequence of disagreements between Ehlers and his wife, she left him at Pottsville and came to Philadelphia, to support herself with her needle before the birth of George.

On the 28th October 1838, he applied to the Court of Common Pleas of Schuylkill county, for a divorce on the ground of two years’ prior desertion and persistence therein by his wife, and on the 24th July 1839 a divorce was decreed.
