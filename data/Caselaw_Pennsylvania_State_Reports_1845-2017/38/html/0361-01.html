The right to use the streets of Philadelphia for railways is nothing more than a license; they were given originally by the owners for highways, and for no other purpose. If there is any violation of vested rights, it is of those of the original owners.</p>

E. Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Casey, 2 Casey 287. The franchise of complainants, if there ever was one as claimed, was taken away by defendants’ supplement. These charters being but revocable licenses, can be at any time repealed. Complainants could have no right to that which did not exist. The charter of defendants was the beginning of complainants’ right to use defendants’ road, and that by its terms repealed the right. It was born and died in the same moment. As to the effect of the supplement and its connection with the original act, he cited: The Prince of Wales <em>v. </em>The Bristol Water Works, 30 E. C. L. and Eq. R. 565; The O. W. &amp; W.

On the contrary, it is declared that the defendants shall have the exclusive right to use and occupy the streets named for railway purposes; and it seems to us that this means the exclusive right to lay their track on the streets, and also, and were to have, <em>a fortiori, </em>the exclusive right to use their own rails when laid.</p>

Of course we are not expected to enforce a legislative promise. A right is a relation of a person or persons to some thing or person, and from its very nature it cannot arise or exist in advance of the persons and things related, and of which it expresses the relation. Neither the road of the defendants nor the right to make it existed when the plaintiffs were incorporated with the right <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>insisted on, and of course their alleged right attached to nothing, and was therefore no right at all.</p>

It follows, therefore, that the plaintiffs never acquired any right as against the defendants or their railway track, and that their bill was properly dismissed.</p>
