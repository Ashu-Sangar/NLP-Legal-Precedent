I examined the line on Jack’s Mountain; have run part of all the boundary lines of the two tracts; the division line, if I ever examined for it, I never found it; I believe surveys were made on the ground, as they purport to be by that draft, except the division line, which I do not recollect to have examined for.</p>

His widow and part of the family continued to occupy the land until 1831 certainly, and perhaps to 1832 or ’33 — most probably till 1832. On the 5th of April 1810, Kemberly and wife conveyed their improvement right to William Lewis. Surveys are produced by the defendant, describing this land, but not made by authority of any warrant granted for that, purpose, in the name of William Lewis, and were not admitted in evidence for the purpose of showing any title in the defendants, but as matter of description of the extent Lewis claimed, corresponding with lines marked on the ground. A judgment was obtained against the administrator of William Lewis, which was levied, among other lands, on a tract in Wayne township, surveyed in the name of William Lewis, containing 349 acres and 94 perches, which it is said corresponds with ■the drafts given in evidence, including the Kemberly improvement, which was sold in 1825 to A. S. Wilson, who purchased it for Joseph Milliken and others, who sold it soon after to D. W. Hulings. Mr. Hulings entered into an agreement, on lease, with Susannah Kemberly, to hold the land under him, on the 22d of May 1832. Susannah Kemberly was the widow of Charles Kemberly, and if she left the land in 1831, she never held possession under this agreement. If she was living on the land, as testified to by some of the witnesses, she left possession of it soon after the date of the lease, and never returned to it to occupy it. She went to Bedford county, but returned to this county in 1838 or ’39, and, George Allen says, wanted to go on the land, but did not. She did not, however, return to the land. Mr. Allen says that in the spring of 1838, Mr. Hulings got him to put up a cabin house on the Kemberly tract; that he also fenced in an acre or an acre and a half of the land, and sowed some flax-seed and oats, but did not go to reside on the land. The next occupant of the premises that had been occupied by the Kemberlies, was Samuel Sample, who went into possession in 1842. During the time the Kemberlies occupied, no person -not having a right under their improvement, could locate a warrant to hold the land they occupied. <em>Robb’s warrant was located, including it, in May </em>1837. At this time their improvement .was unoccupied. The <em>defendant </em>does not pretend to have acquired a title under any warrant for the land from the commonwealth, or to show that any warrant was ever issued to any person for it from the commonwealth. Robb, the plaintiff, took out his warrant in 1837. It remained until then unappropriated, and was vacant land at the time of Robb’s survey. “ An improvement on vacant land is nothing of itself, and can give the person making it no right whatever to the land, unless it be prosecuted with reasonable diligence, and consummated by an actual personal resident <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>settlement thereon, with a manifest intention of making it a place of abode and the means of supporting a family, and continued from time to time, unless interrupted by the enemy or going into military service during the war.” (He referred to the opinion of Judge Kennedy, in the case of Atchison v.. McCulloch, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%2015" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts 15">5 <em>Watts </em>15</a>.) Although, by the residence ' of the Kemberlies, they had acquired a right by which they might have held 400 acres, yet that right, where the claimant under such residence does not procure his warrant for it from the commonwealth, may be lost by abandoning the possession of it. The commonwealth is entitled to payment for all her lands; and an appropriator — one who takes out a warrant and pays the commonwealth for her land — is not to be'held for ever at bay by an improver .who had abandoned the possession and occupancy of land, which he commenced as an inception of title to it.' It is a continuance of residence, with occasional exceptions of temporary but indispensable interruption of it as circumstances may require, that will vest the right of pre-emption in the settler of vacant land. A settler leaving his improvemeiit for a temporary purpose, with an intention of returning to it, does not lose his right; but if he leaves the possession and occupation of it without an intention of returning to the premises to occupy it as a place of abode, it becomes open to location by a warrantee who has purchased from the commonwealth; and whether there was such intention of returning, frequently and in most instances, is a question of fact for a jury to determine ; but the abandonment may be for such a length of time that the intention to return will not save the improver’s claim against a subsequent warrantee- from the commonwealth appropriating the land .by having his warrant executed. The proof here is 'that the family of the Kemberlies, under whom the defendant claims, or who may have been his tenants, in actual possession, holding from Mr. Hulings, left the premises in 1831, ’2 or ’3. When they left, a question is.raised, was it with an intention to return.to the premises as a place of abode, or was it the intention of Mr. Hulings, the landlord, to put another in possession to hold for him. Mr. Hulings, in 1838, aslred Allen to put up a cabin for him. Allen did, and sowed some flax and oats; but this was not the actual resident occupation required by the act of Assembly to enable a settler to hold against the warrantee. Mrs. Kemberly returned to this county in 1838, but did not go upon it, and it was not again occupied until 1842, when <em>Sample went into the possession of it, under Mr. Hulings. </em>This intention manifested by Mr. Hulings, of holding claim to the land, and of again occupying, <em>was after Hobb had loeated his warrant, </em>and the intention in 1838 to claim will not avail the improver any thing, after proof of non-occupation from 1831 or ’32 until 1842. Graham, who occupied a part of the land by Charles Kemberly, left, as he says, with an intention never to return to it. The Kemberlies went <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>to Bedford in 1831 .or ’32; the sons never returned to this county, and the mother did not return to the county until 1838. On the improvement commenced by Charles Kemberly there was no occupation, by either • residence or cultivation, during that period. George Allen says, Mr. Hulings asked him, when he went to that place in 1835, to look a little after the land for him, and says he built a cabin for Mr. Hulings, where Charles Kemberly lived in 1837 or ’38, covered it with boards and fenced up a patch, sowed some oats and flax on it, and kept up the fences for two or three years. On his cross-examination, he says there was no floor in it, and that it was not designed for any person to live in it. <em>The old Kemberly house </em>had gone d.own, and when so suffered to go down for the length of time that elapsed from the time the Kemberlies left until Robb’s warrant was located, and from the manner in which the improvement was suffered to dilapidate, was certainly not such a prosecution of a settlement and residence as the law requires to secure title to land by an improver, without a warrant from the commonwealth. Under these .circumstances, after an abandonment, .an intent merely to resume the settlement is immaterial. To substitute claim for residence, and convenience for prosecution of title, would subvert the whole doctrine of improvement. It is the continuance of residence, with such occasional exceptions of temporary but indispensable interruption of it as circumstances may require, which is the groundwork of the title. The defendant’s right does not depend on the intention to return to reside on the land, after abandoning without an intention to return to it, for th.e length of time that this improvement was unoccupied, and particularly when such intention to return is not manifested until after a warrant granted by the commonwealth i.s actually located.</p>

George Allen says Bostian Bhodes made an improvement a year or two after 1820, or about that time; he lived there till he died, in, 1838, or winter of 1839. I spoke to the old man once, and asked him if he had the land on his own hook, or under an agreement with any one; he said he had an agreement with Lewis, or Sunderland, or Bratton, who had charge of Lewis’s land. I do not know whether Bratton was executor ; he had something to do with the land. (A record in evidence shows that Bratton was one of the executors of Lewis.) I think I had more than one conversation with Bostian about it; he worked for me sometimes; never alleged the title was in any other person than Lewis. I lived near him. Mr. Shaw, who located the warrant of Bobb, says, “He (Bostian Bhodes) stated that he claimed in his own right. I asked him if he had marked his boundary as to the extent of his claim; he said he had not. I then told him we would throw him out of the survey and give him some woodland with his cleared land; we did so, and he appeared satisfied.” On cross-examination he says, “I do not recollect that I said he could not hold by his improvement; told him we would run round it and leave him his improvement and some woodland; he went with us. I cannot say that he said he was satisfied; he appeared satisfied ; he said he had not his boundaries marked. I told him he ought to have had his lines marked. Bobert Graham says: “ I lived about half a mile from Bostian Bhodes; was well acquainted with him when he lived there; he told me <em>he claimed the land for himself; </em>two or three times during the 7 years, (the 7 years he lived on the Kemberly claim,) and perhaps more, I understood it from him.” Cross-examined: — “ He did not tell me how much he claimed there.

    <p id="b319-7" data-blocks='[["BL_319.7",319,[138,681,1172,258]]]'>But as the drafts were offered first by the defendant below, without any warrant being given in evidence, improvement, or location, they were properly rejected. The most that would accrue from these papers was evidence of boundary, and not title. But there was no claim in evidence which they could bound. This ends the 1st exception to evidence.</p>
    <p id="b319-8" data-blocks='[["BL_319.8",319,[140,938,1172,249]]]'>The offer to give “ <em>the talk of </em>the neighbors” in evidence was rightfully rejected. It is the first time I have heard that such evidence as “ It was always spoken of in the neighborhood as Lewis’s land,” was entitled to any weight whatever on the trial of an ejectment, or was an element of title. The 2d exception is not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b319-9" data-blocks='[["BL_319.9",319,[138,1198,1174,290]]]'>There is nothing in the 3d exception. The paper, if a transcript of lines on the ground, might be evidence if the defendant showed that when his improvement was commenced and prosecuted he claimed up to those lines and adopted them as the boundary of his claim; and that far the court admitted them, and for that purpose, and this was right. The papers in themselves were no evidence whatever of title.</p>
    <p id="b319-10" data-blocks='[["BL_319.10",319,[140,1497,1173,473]]]'>It appears distinctly enough that William C. Cornwell was sworn before he gave his deposition. I do not see how that fact could be doubted after reading the caption. It is sufficiently certain that the deposition was taken at the place appointed. It was taken in York county, Chanceford township, at the office of Joseph Stermer, Esq., a justice of the peace, &amp;e. The rule says it is to be taken at the office of Joseph-Stormer, Esq., &amp;c. This is a mere literal error in spelling the na'me. It would be good under the principle of <em>idom sonans, </em>until it was shown that in Chanceford township there were two justices, one Joseph Stermer, and the other Joseph Stormer. Therefore the 4th exception is of no moment.</p>
    <p id="b319-11" data-blocks='[["BL_319.11",319,[141,1971,1175,428]],["BL_320.1",320,[293,380,1171,300]]]'>Rhodes claimed in his own right, as alleged by plaintiff, and not under any one else; he lived on the ground, had built a cabin sixteen feet square, and cleared a little land; his declarations then made on the ground and at the time a survey was to be executed, were good evidence as to the extent of his claim — there could be none better. But these declarations ought not to have affected the right or claim of Lewis. The court, however, distinctly stated that these declarations were good for nothing, except to define the claim or boundary of Rhodes, who was dead at the trial, and to that extent they were admitted in evidence. There is no error in <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>this exception. Kemberly’s declarations were evidence to show how he occupied the land: he was living on it, making improvements, and had built a house; his declarations to Graham that he claimed the land as his own,- and his offer to give Graham, who was his son-imlaw, a certain portion of the land if he would improve and live on it, were evidence that he did not occupy or claim under Lewis or Hulings.</p>
    <p id="b320-6" data-blocks='[["BL_320.4",320,[291,679,1170,289]]]'>The argument used against these declarations being received was that Rhodes and Kemberly occupied under Lewis, and that a tenant could not' defeat the title of his landlord. That he cann'ot, is very true ; nor can he set up title against him. But the court could not assume that the testimony of Allen in respect to these admissions was in this respect absolutely true, and exclude evidence which went to contradict it.</p>
    <p id="b320-7" data-blocks='[["BL_320.5",320,[288,976,1173,387]]]'>It was a question for the jury to determine what was the character’ of the occupancy of Rhodes and Kemberly from the evidence,.and particularly of Rhodes, under the circumstances. And the court put the case to the jury on that footing, to wit, that if Rhodes was the tenant of Lewis or Hulings, that those declarations should not affect Hulings, who claims under Lewis. Both Kemberly and Rhodes'were dead before the trial, and their declarations made on the land at the time they occupied were admissible in evidence to show how they occupied it.</p>
    <p id="b320-8" data-blocks='[["BL_320.6",320,[286,1364,1171,426]]]'>There is nothing in the 7th bill of exceptions. The testimony of Graham, that there was no improvement on the Sunderland tract, and no residence on the part claimed by Lewi's, was not impertinent or irrelevant. It tended to elucidate and explain the matter in, controversy; and as to its not being strictly rebutting, that- is of little consequence. For, in a case so mixed up with conflicting claims- as this, an important fact is sometimes omitted in its proper order, or its necessity and usefulness not perceived until developments on the other side manifest its importance. It could not have taken the other party by surprise, for obvious reasons'.</p>
    <p id="b320-9" data-blocks='[["BL_320.7",320,[286,1791,1168,589]]]'>The evidence of abandonment may be so clear as to justify the court in telling the jury, as a matter of law, that there lias been an abandonment; but the court does not go so' far in this case. They recapitulate the facts and instruct the' jury what am'o'unts to an abandonment, and perhaps intimate that in their opinion there was an abandonment. This intimation, however, is to be drawn more from the facts which they recapitulate, and the law which they declare and announce, and in which they do not err, than from any positive declaration. But they submit the whole matter of fact as to the continued actual resident settlement, both as to Rhodes and Kemberly, and also Hulings, to the jury, and instruct them that if such settlement was proved in their judgment, that then the plaintiff was not entitled to recover; and give the jury suitable instructions as to what constituted such settlement-.</p>

      <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>We see no error in that part of the charge designated in the 8th error assigned. The court distinctly submit the fact whether Rhodes was in under Lewis or not. It is true, they do not mention the evidence of Allen; nor do they mention the testimony of witnesses the other way. But they distinctly say that if Rhodes was <em>not in under Lewis, </em>and did not object to the location of Robb’s warrant, and was satisfied with the location, that a deed made by him afterwards to Hulings could not affect the location of the warrant, or Robb’s title under it: and in this they were right. Taking the sentence in connection with what they had said before on the subject of Rhodes being in under Lewis, the jury could have no doubt but that if Rhodes was in under Lewis, his agreement to the location could not affect Lewis or Hulings, who claimed under him.</p>
