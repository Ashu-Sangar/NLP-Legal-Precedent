The contract goes on to provide for the contingency of McAllen’s inability to make an arrangement, and leaves it optional with them to remove the goods or to seek their remedy for the materials already furnished. Their remedy how ? Unquestionably by suit for their value.

It was optional with Haywood &amp; Snyder whether he should or not. They left the articles there for nearly one year afterwards. The fair presumption then is, that they made their election under the contract, and agreed to leave the goods with him, although no arrangement was made. Against that presumption you have the evidence of McAllen, that he never considered these articles his, that they were not to be, until paid for, and the improbability that the plaintiffs would agree to part with their property to an insolvent man. But McAllen’s understanding alone is insufficient. The plaintiffs, and not he, had the right of election, and you must have some proof to satisfy you that they made the election in order to counteract the presumption arising from. their long silence. Mr. Berryhill, it is contended by the plaintiffs’ counsel, testified that he had repeated conversations, as well after as before the article was made, and along through the summer, with McAllen, in which he stated his client’s intention to remove the goods, but was prevented by Mr. McAllen stating that Mr. Fisher (who had writs in the sheriff’s hands the whole time) threatened to bring suit against him if he did. The defendant’s counsel contends that these conversations were all before the article was entered into, and that he did not speak of any after. You will have to decide between them. If no conversation took place after the three months expired, the plaintiffs never made the required election, and cannot recover. If it took place soon after, so as to show they made the election in a reasonable time, the article does not stand in the way of a recovery. This is the most important <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>fact you have to decide: almost every thing else has been argued as questions of law.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[311,454,1167,1713]]]'>Were these boilers fixtures ? You have heard the evidence as to the purpose for which they were placed in the building, and the manner in which they were built around; that they were not secured in any way, but that it would be difficult, and might be impracticable to remove them without some injury, though slight, to the building. ■ Where a workman contracts to put up machinery of great value, such as this, to be paid for on completion, and, when finished, the person with whom he has contracted refuses to make payment, I have no doubt of his right at once to remove it, although, in so doing, he should to a limited extent injure the building in which it is placed. Such a right is as much secured to him for the benefit and encouragement of trade as to the tenant, who may remove almost every structure placed by him on demised premises to carry on his business. It cannot be that the machinist shall be deprived of machinery worth several thousand dollars because the building in which it is erected may in its removal be damaged to the amount of five or fifty dollars, more especially when a violation of the contract on the part of the owner leads to the necessity of its removal. But the right of re-caption in such cases must be <em>promptly exercised ; </em>a man cannot sell an article to another, and, because he is not paid, go at a distant day to his premises and remove it. Had these boilers been once used as part of the machinery, and detached for a temporary purpose, I should consider them as still part of the freehold. They had never been used nor prepared for use. The whole machinery was in a course of erection. Whether attached to and part of the freehold, is in part a question of intention, to be determined by you. If placed in the building with the expectation that the other part of the machinery should be attached to it, and the whole remain the property of the plaintiffs until completion and payment, according to the terms of the contract, they should not be considered real property, or fixtures, even if some small portion of the building would have to be displaced in order to remove them. The witnesses generally agree that they could not be removed without taking out the door-frame, and all state they could be by removing it, which would do no essential injury. The parties in interest have all treated these boilers as personal property. The sheriff levied on and sold them as such. McAllen said he always considered that they belonged to the plaintiffs, although he would do no act to affect the rights of his creditors.</p>

Haywood &amp; Snyder proceeded to construct the engine, and, in the progress of the work, brought to the mill of McAllen in Dauphin county, the two boilers, -a balance-wheel, and some other parts of the machine. McAllen was to prepare the foundation and the enclosure. The boilers were laid loose on the foundation prepared, and the walls and building to enclose them were partially erected, but not completed, when McAllen became embarrassed by the claims of his creditors. It was intended by McAllen to enclose the boilers in a way that would admit of their removal out of the small building that covered them ; but some error in the position of the door would not allow of that removal without displacing a small part of the brick wall and the door-frame. Haywood &amp; Snyder had prepared the other parts of the engine, and which were on their way to the place of erection, when, on account of the pressure of McAllen by his creditors, they were stopped, and the progress of the work to completion suspended, with the approbation of McAllen, who said he could not comply with his part of the agreement. McAllen entertained the expecta<a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>tion that he would still be able to make some arrangement with his creditors that would allow him to retain his real property. By an agreement between Haywood &amp; Snyder, by Mr. Berryhill their attorney, and McAllen, dated 18th January 1848, it was declared that the iron boilers then in the building attached to the mill, were the property of Haywood &amp; Snyder, who agreed to leave the same where they were for three months from that date, giving this time to McAllen for the purpose of making an arrangement with his creditors ; and in the event of his inability to make such arrangement, then Haywood &amp; Snyder were to be left to their legal remedy for so much of the materials as were already furnished, or to the removal of the same at their option: and further, in the event of an arrangement with the creditors aforesaid, the said Haywood &amp; Snyder are to put up the engine complete to the satisfaction of McAllen, he <em>securing </em>them for the same, upon such terms and time as may be agreed upon between the parties.</p>

Shell, under his levy, sold the boilers and wheel on the 12th January 1849, having on the 8th of the same month made a levy on the mill and other real property, with a minute description. Notice was given Shell that Haywood &amp; Snyder claimed the boilers and balance-wheel as their property, and Shell afterwards acknowledged that he was indemnified, for his proceedings. The mill and real estate of McAllen were sold at sheriff’s sale on the 25th of April 1849, for $7005, and a deed made and acknowledged by the sheriff to S. Cameron on the 26th of April 1849.</p>

The admission of the evidence was objected to by defendant, and exception taken, which is now assigned for error. This evidence does appear to this court to hare been pertinent and competent.

The time given wás^or the accommodation of McAllen, to allow him to make,an arrangement with his creditors; and whatever extension of time there was in allowing the boilers to remain on McAllen’s freehold, contravened then the rights of no one but Haywood &amp; Snyder and McAllen. McAllen was the only person who had any right to object or require removal; and as he acquiesced, he is presumed to hold the possession subject to the will and demand of Haywood &amp; Snyder. McAllen no doubt clung to the hope that he could still make an arrangement to the advantage of his creditors ; and if this were to be effected by a sale, that the arrangement might provide for the use of the steam-engine to be completed by Haywood &amp; Snyder — McAllen securing them for the price of <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>the engine. Such expectation may account for the forbearance of the makers to remove, and the willingness of McAllen to hold the possession as bailee for Haywood &amp; Snyder.</p>
    <p id="b531-6" data-blocks='[["BL_531.4",531,[144,507,1174,375]]]'>The possession of McAllen under the, circumstances could not deceive or mislead any of his creditors. The possession of part of an unfinished engine would lead either creditor or purchaser of ordinary vigilance to inquire into the condition of the contract. No creditor or purchaser was misled. The debts contracted by McAllen were antecedent to the delivery of any part of the engine. There was not in this case either legal or constructive fraud to divest Haywood &amp; Snyder of their right of property in the boilers or wheel.</p>
    <p id="b531-7" data-blocks='[["BL_531.5",531,[142,891,1176,718]]]'>The defendant, who places his defence in part on the allegation that the boilers were a part of the realty, made, as sheriff, his levy on them as personal property to.be severed and removed, and sold them at public sale as personal property. After his levy on the boilers and wheel, he levied on the mill and realty, with a minute description of its improvements and advantages, without embracing the boilers, which he had made the subject of distinct levy and sale. The defendant received notice before the sale by him of the claim of Haywood <em>k </em>Snyder to the boilers and wheel, which he did not regard. For his proceeding he said he was indemnified. The purchaser of the realty at sheriff’s sale did not purchase in ignorance of the claim by the manufacturers of the boilers and wheel. They had been treated by the sheriff as personal property, removable, and sold as such on the same execution by which the realty was levied. The unfinished condition of the engine was enough to lead a purchaser to inquire whose property it was.</p>
    <p id="b531-8" data-blocks='[["BL_531.6",531,[142,1618,1173,344]]]'>This case, in the opinion of the court, is governed by the intention and agreement of the parties having the control of the rights of property and possession in the boilers and wheel of the unfinished engine; and under the contracts between them, the plaintiffs, Haywood &amp; Snyder, had both the right of property and the right to possession of the boilers and wheel at the time of the levy and sale made by defendant. The right of removal was in the plaintiffs, and the right to -sustain this action.</p>
    <p id="b531-9" data-blocks='[["BL_531.7",531,[143,1961,1169,118]]]'>The other errors assigned by plaintiff in error are not, in the opinion of the court, sustained, and the judgment of the court below is affirmed.</p>
