See also Martin <em>v. </em>Jones, 6 <em>Barr </em>82, to the same effect. In determining the question of interest, when the evidence is <em>aliunde, </em>and it depends on intricate questions of fact, the judge, in his discretion, may take the opinion of the jury upon them.

Viewing the case in this aspect, we are relieved from the necessity of deciding whether a mistake of the judge (unless it be a very gross mistake) in determining the weight of parol evidence can be corrected on error; and if it can, (as I suppose it may,) whether the court was wrong' in the view taken of the conflicting testimony.</p>

Conceding this, it may be inquired what reason (if any) can be assigned, why he should be at liberty to testify before the jury, when substituted to try the same fact in place of the court. It may be asked, ought not the latter to be bound by the same rules as the former ? Why should there be any difference, in this respect, between the court and jury, when performing the same office. That the rules of evidence, which it is important to preserve, should be relaxed before the latter tribunal, seems to be reversing the order of things.
