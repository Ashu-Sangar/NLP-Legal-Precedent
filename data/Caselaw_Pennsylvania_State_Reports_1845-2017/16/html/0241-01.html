But it must be remembered, that this question arises under the constitution and laws of the United States, that the decisions of the State courts thereon, denying the right claimed under the federal enactments, are subject to review in the Supreme Court of the United States, and that in that high tribunal the several States of this Union are not regarded as foreign States, nor are their laws and judgments held to be foreign laws and judgments. In that court the. States, their laws, and their judicial proceedings, are essentially domestic, and are taken notice of as such. It would be a very imperfect administration of justice for the court of original jurisdiction to adopt one rule of decision, while the court of final resort was governed by a different one. It follows necessarily, that the State courts, in determining questions of federal cognizance, ought to adopt the rules of decision known to prevail in the tribunal entitled to give the controlling decision. By the act of Congress of 1790, the judgment recovered in* Maryland, is to have the same effect in Pennsylvania that it has in the former State. In that State the courts take judicial notice of the existence of the common law, and of those principles of that law which render the judgment conclusive upon the parties and privies. A fair execution of the act of Congress, requires that the judge in Pennsylvania should also take notice of the system of jurisprudence which prevails in a sister State, united under a common government, and should give effect to the judgment as fully as would be given to it in the State in which it was pronounced. In cases not' arising under the constitution and laws of the general government, the laws of the several States may properly be regarded by each other as foreign laws. But we apprehend that an entirely different rule prevails in all cases where a right is claimed under the constitution or laws of the Union.</p>
