On this a fi. fa. was issued to August term 1850, on which defendant’s real estate, consisting of an improved farm of about 65 acres, was levied, an inquisition held and the property condemned, and a <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued to November term 1850, on which said real estate was sold by the sheriff. <em>After </em>the sale, defendant served a notice on the sheriff claiming $300 out of the money arising from the sale, under the provisions of the act of 9th April 1849. When the fi. fa. on which the land was levied was issued, or at any subsequent period until after his property had been struck off by the sheriff, Lee did not give notice of his claim, or require the sheriff to have an appraisement made, &amp;c.</p>

Further, that the attorney of Mr. Miller was present at the sale of defendant’s real estate, and bid the same up to a sum sufficient to cover his judgment, and would have bid $300 more for the property, had notice been given that defendant would claim that sum out of the sale.

The sum bid for the property by the junior judgment creditor was sufficient to cover the record liens, if the $300 are not withdrawn for the debtor. The omission to give notice would have the tendency of misleading creditors; and in behalf of the junior judgment creditor it is testified that if the claim of the debtor to the exemption had been made even before the sale, he would have bid the property to an amount that would have covered it and the prior judgments. The silence of the debtor during the whole course of the proceedings in execution can scarcely, under the circumstances, be imputed to ignorance of the law, more especially when it appears that as a debtor he had claimed and retained on a former execution the exemptions allowed of personal property under the acts of 1836 and 1846. Ignorance of the law is not an excuse, and it is not for a debtor to plead that ignorance when the provision of law was one of great notoriety, and which conferred on him so substantial a favor. It is the gratuity of the law, which he ought to be satisfied to tahe under the provisions and guards which the law granting it has imposed, and which are neither expensive, onerous, or unreasonable.
