McCulloch said that General Miller had seen Lewis Carpenter, and had offered him the money, and that he refused to take it, but sent it back. At the same time, McCulloch stated that he had sent the money a second time with General Miller, and that time Miller could not find him.

In 1844 McKee executed to McCulloch a single bill, given in evidence, for the amount of his due-bill to Carpenter, payable ten days after date, and had delivered up to him the due bill, and the order of Lewis Carpenter without date, to D. J. McKee to <em>pay </em>the note to D. W. McCulloch. • McCulloch, as was admitted, was to pay Carpenter for McKee, which was not done.</p>

His having done so would not change the relation of debtor and creditor between McKee and Carpenter, and the liability of the former to the latter to pay the money was not changed thereby.” The court also say, “Wehave only considered the case in this aspect, to enable us to answer the -plaintiff’s points, which he desired us to consider abstractly, for these facts do not constitute the whole case as exhibited by the testimony,” and added, “ It will be observed that the evidence which makes up the facts, consisted of the acknowledgments of the plaintiff as to what the consideration of the note was ; and it was a part of those acknowledgments, that after he had taken the note of defendant, he sent the money to Carpenter, who declined taking it, saying that he wanted Mr. McCulloch to keep it, as he then had no need of it. If this be the truth of the ease, of which the jury must judge, and there is as much evidence of it as of the other facts embraced in the conversations of McCulloch alluded to, then, by Carpenter’s consent, his debtor was changed, the arrangement of Mr. McColloch, by which he took the note, was <em>ratified </em>— he thereby became the debtor of Carpenter, and McKee was released.

In this view of the case the plaintiff is entitled to recover, as McCulloch had commuted for the money without authority, and had not paid McKee according to his engagement, when he took to himself McKee’s note. The material inquiry was whether Carpenter had assented to the arrangement made by his agent, and dispensed with the payment over to him by McCulloch. This was matter of fact for the jury. The acknowledgments of McCulloch were to be taken entire as evidence. As an admission, it would not have been competent for the court to have received part and rejected part: the whole must be submitted to the jury. What credit is to be given to the whole or part, is a question for the consideration and discretion of a jury: 2 <em>Stark. Ev. </em>pl. 4, p. 49. The question arising on this admission, as to assent and ratification and the legal effect of it, was submitted fairly to the jury, and favorably to the plaintiff, and it was for their decision.
