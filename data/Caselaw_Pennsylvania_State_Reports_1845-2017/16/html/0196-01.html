The transcript of the justice’s docket, in this case, shows the justice’s jurisdiction — the plaintiff’s claim having been reduced to below $100 by direct payments: Cooper <em>v. </em>Coats, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Dal.%20308" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Dal. 308">1 <em>Dal. </em>308</a>; Stewart <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 13 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>287. The office of the declaration is to state the plaintiff’s cause of action, and not the defendant’s defence. The damages suffered by a plaintiff may be less than $100 when a suit is instituted, yet after an appeal, when the declaration is filed, may be more than $100. Therefore, the laying of a sum over $100 in the declaration does not show a want of jurisdiction in the justice: Rankin <em>v. </em>Murry, <a href="/pa/2/0074-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Pa. 74" data-case-ids="951097" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0074-01">2 <em>Pa.

When there is a division of the labors and employment of a husband and wife, at home or abroad, and the husband permits his wife to act and be employed in the business of life with others, he necessarily commits to her the agency and control of her actions and contracts. His consent is to be presumed as giving to her power to contract and make engagements, for which she is to receive the wages and profit; and if she is thus made competent to contract, she may certainly furnish evidence, whilst engaged in the business, of the terms of the contract in which she is employed, as part of the <em>res gestee. </em>The husband who permits his wife to be engaged in the domestic service of other families by hiring, which is, it is believed, a common occurrence, cannot with propriety object to the terms which she made, and on which she was retained, and the services rendered. She was allowed to obtain the situation, and it must be held on the terms which she made, and of which her declarations at the time, and whilst engaged in the work, are evidence. His consent is to be presumed, and the presumption is only rebutted by objection or prohibition on the part of the husband; and until such objection, her engagement would be the measure of his right for her services. In the case of Spencer <em>v. </em>Tisue <em>Add. </em>319, it is said the cares of matrimony, the duties of management are divided ; the husband assumes some parts, and submits other parts to the cares of the wife. When he acts or submits, he is bound. There may be a presumed agency in their common concerns, with which every wife is presumed to be vested, &amp;c. In McKinley <em>v. </em>McGregor, in this court, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Whart.%20569" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 Whart. 569">5 <em>Whar. </em>569</a>, it is ruled, if husband and wife live together, any business in which she may be engaged is presumed to be conducted by her with his knowledge and as his agent.</p>
