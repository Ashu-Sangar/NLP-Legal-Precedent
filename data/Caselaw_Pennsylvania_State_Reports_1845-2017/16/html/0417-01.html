If in the latter, she is entitled to recover in this action, notwithstanding the sale of the property by the sheriff in 1843, as, the property of Daniel Ermold. The premises were bought at the sale by Charles Feather, under whom the defendants claim. It does not appear that notice of the claim of Sarah Ermold was given at the sale. Evidence has been given of Ermold’s declarations before and after 1840, that the property was not his, but his wife’s. You will judge whether this referred to the mode and proceedings by which the property came into his hands, and is to be regarded as an expression of opinion as to the title, or to what else it referred.

When Adam died, and shortly afterwards his mother, Adam’s property went to his surviving brothers and sisters. Sarah Ermold was one of the sisters, and entitled to one sixth part of it. When the others contracted to sell the lot to Daniel Ermold by the article dated in September 1822, for $900, he was to pay for it by allowing so much out of his wife’s share in her deceased father’s estate, if so much should be coming to her ; if not, he was to pay the difference. As to, so much of John Spohn’s estate as had been takemat the appraisement, or sold, Sarah Ermold’s share was money, which could be paid to no other person than to Daniel Ermold, during his life. He could receive it and make valid acquittances for it. He could assign it for money or lands, or any valuable consideration. The land that remained was to be sold either by order of court, or by the parties in interest. In either case it would become money, which Daniel Ermold would be entitled to receive, if living when the land should be sold. The land was actually sold by the parties, and Daniel Ermold receipted for the money with the other <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>grantors. It was in contemplation of the sale of the land, which had been refused by all the heirs, that Ermold contracted for the purchase of the lot. It was a disposal of the money coming to his wife in anticipation of its receipt from the sale of the lands, and the money was actually in hand at the time he was to get his deed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b421-6" data-blocks='[["BL_421.4",421,[127,645,1180,1336]]]'>If Ermold had taken this lot at the appraisement, and entered into recognizance to secure the other shares, and had paid the shares by applying his wife’s interest in the recognizance of other heirs, or in the purchase-money of other lands sold, the law would give him five-sixths of the lot in his own right, and he would hold the remainder in the right of his wife. Did he vary his rights by purchasing the shares of the other parties in interest, and agreeing to pay for them with the moneys coming to his wife out of her father’s estate ? We think not. Sarah Ermold’s interest in this lot <em>was as heir to her </em>brother, <em>Adam Spohn. </em>Her husband did not pay for it with any interest of hers in <em>Adam Spohn's </em>property. One sixth part of the lot was hers, as heir to her brother, and that was unaltered by the transaction between Ermold and the other heirs. It was not her interest in the lands of her father with which the lot was paid for. It was with the moneys arising from the sale of those lands, which moneys were the husband’s, if he chose to make them so, either by receiving them, or assigning them, or buying land with them and taking the title in his own name. Where lands are devised to be sold, and the proceeds divided among legatees by the executors, and some of the legatees are married women, and all the legatees elect to take their legacies in land instead of money, it is held that the husbands, by taking deeds in their own names, indicate their intention to reduce the money into possession, in the form of land, and the land becomes their own. This is because the husband in such cases, as in the case before us, had the right to control the money and dispose of it at his pleasure. Daniel Ermold, we think, in his written contract with the other parties in interest, indicated his intention to appropriate his wife’s share of the moneys arising from the sale of her father’s estate to himself, in providing for a conveyance of the land bought with those moneys to himself. •</p>

In the latter case, the husbands will be regarded as trustees for their wives. This doctrine, however, is confined to cases of partition, in which the consideration for the releases is the land of the wife assigned to the releasor, and not to cases where the 'consideration is money of the wife, which the husband could control and dispose of at <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>pleasure. No land was assigned to the parties here agreeing to convey to Ermold. The conveyance to Solomon. Spohn was simply a sale for money, and the buyer of the larger tract was a Stranger. Under this agreement, Daniel Ermold became a purchaser in his own right of the shares of the other heirs of Adam Spohn in this lot, although he may have paid for them with the moneys to which his wife was entitled out of her father’s estate. In her own share, which was one sixth part, he acquired no greater interest than a life estate. After his death the title remained in her. Even in cases of partition, it has been held that a deed of release to the husband with a money consideration expressed in it, and containing no notice of the nature of the transaction, would be sufficient to vest in a purchaser of the land at sheriff’s sale, as the land of the husband, without notice, the title and beneficial interest.
