Colonel Lee had a running account in the store from March 1847 until about the time they stopped. He also kept a pass-book, which was kept to correspond with his store-account. <em>The account against Lee on the </em>store-book, <em>or rather the balance due on his account, amounts to </em>$1869 <em>and some cents, up to 2d October </em>1848. The rent of the store-room had been credited to him at the end of each quarter, or when he settled his account in the store. The rent was credited up to the 1st October 1848. I think the rent for the store and two adjoining buildings was $150 per year. I have seen Mr. Lee’s pass-book frequently, and know the custom was to make it correspond with the store-account in which the credits of rent are entered. I don’t suppose the quarter’s rent due October 1, 1848, was entered in his pass-book. I presume all the others were. <em>And upon cross examination, </em>he said: — A considerable part of Colonel Lee’s account in the store was for goods furnished to men working under the direction of Andrew Lee, at Colonel Lee’s mines, at the village of Nanticoke. Colonel Lee’s account was settled at certain times by the clerk in the store. I cannot say how often the balance was struck.</p>

The notice to produce it was given two days before the trial, to Mr. Alricks, his attorney, in Harrisburg. No facility of travel nor mode of' communication could have brought it <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>in that time. The plaintiff came to try on the plea of payment; he could have had no notice or legal warning that it was necessary for him to carry this hook to the trial. But, as alleged, it was a mere transcript, or equivalent in its entries to the partnership books of Porter &amp; Holland. Why then did they not bring on their own books; they were the proper evidence of the account, or the alleged balance was admissible under ■ the pleadings. The part of the deposition therefore of William Stewart, which relates to the contents of the pass-book, and its alleged equivalent, the store-books of Porter &amp; Holland, was properly rejected. He says that “ in superintending the mines, he also had a supervision over the store and store-accounts. Colonel Lee had a running account in the store. He kept a pass-book, which was kept to correspond with his store-account. The balance due on his account amounts to $&gt;1869 and some cents, up to October 1848.” He does not say who made the entries, what the nature of the charges was nor that he knew the handwriting, or made the entries himself.</p>

Because it is clear that a witness may not speak of particular facts appearing on the books or deducible from the entries without producing the books. Eor where the writing or entries were not made by the witness himself, his testimony, so far as founded on it, is no more than hearsay. And why should a witness be allowed to give evidence of his inference rather from what a third person has written, than from what a third person has said. These entries in the pass-book and store-book may, besides, have covered things or money which are not the subject of evidence by book-entry, and such evidence, if admitted, would destroy and overturn all the safeguards which the law has thrown around this kind of testimony.</p>
