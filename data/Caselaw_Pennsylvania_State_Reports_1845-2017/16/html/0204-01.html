Among other things in his declaration, the plaintiff alleges that the defendant, in speaking of the plaintiff in the presence and hearing of different persons,, falsely and maliciously said of him as follows: “Bushey is guilty of every thing that is mean and dirty. He lies and swears, steals and cheats.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b206-6" data-blocks='[["BL_206.4",206,[281,643,1175,1191]]]'>It is contended by the defendant’s counsel, that there is no evidence in support of this, and we are asked so to instruct the jury. A number of witnesses have testified that they heard the defendant say that the plaintiff <em>would </em>lie, swear, cheat, and steal. The testimony of these witnesses does not go to support the charge referred to. The charge is that he <em>does </em>steal, &amp;c., and the testimony is, that he <em>would </em>steal, &amp;c. To say of a man he <em>would </em>steal, is but to impute to him a want of honesty, or at most, a thievish propensity, to which he might yield under certain circumstances, as where the temptation is strong, or impunity probable or nearly certain, or if it were not for the law. One witness, however, James A. Miller, testifies that the defendant, in speaking of the plaintiff, said he will lie, swear, cheat, and steal, and do any thing else that is ordinary. If this witness testifies correctly, his testimony establishes the truth of the charge that the plaintiff steals, &amp;c. Though the allegation and the proof are not precisely the same in words, they are the same in <em>substance, </em>and that is all that the law requires. The words laid in the declaration and those proved would be understood, by the world, as meaning the same thing. To say of a man that he will lie, swear, cheat, and steal, is, in meaning, the same as to say he is addicted to those vices, or that he practises them, or that he lies, swears, cheats, and steals. To say of a dog he will bite people and kill sheep, would as surely fix upon him the character of a vicious, sheep-stealing dog as would the words, he bites people, and kills sheep; or to say of a child, he will neither obey his father nor mother, would no less amount to a charge of disobedience than would the words, he disobeys the commands of his father and his mother.</p>

Now, if the <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>words spoken or proved, without torturing them, would bear that meaning, the court had no right to say that they did not support the allegation in the narr. The words proved were, the plaintiff will “lie, swear, cheat, and steal, and do every thing else that is ornary.” The court say that these words may import that the plaintiff “lies, swears, cheats, and steals.” This was not taking from the jury the right to say, if they so thought, that they were not spoken in that sense, hut were intended to mean that he will lie, eheat, and steal in futitre, if he thinks proper. The frequent repetition of these charges in the same or equivalent words, the number of persons to whom they were spoken, evinced a determination on the part of the defendant to fix on the plaintiff a character rotten in corruption, especially as they were spoken with the avowed purpose of preventing his election as a justice of the peace. All that can fairly be implied from the answer of the court is, that these words may implicate a charge of larceny. They could not take from the jury the right to say that they were spoken in that sense. And nobody will say that the circumstances, the manner of speaking them, and their constant repetition, may not give to them the character of a direct charge. The defendant was very indefinite in his point put to the court, if he wished a more particular instruction. I understand the judge to mean that the words proved are substantially as laid, and that if found as laid, that is, with the <em>innuendo, </em>they do support the action.</p>
    <p id="b209-6" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[148,1425,1172,247]]]'>But the testimony of one of the witnesses comes fully up to the. mark, who says that he met Dottarer on his farm, and he said, “Now I have left all good friends except this damned rascal across the creek, Bushey. I believe he will steal, and I believe he did steal.” If this does not mean' that he stole, I don’t know what it does mean.</p>
    <p id="b209-7" data-blocks='[["BL_209.5",209,[149,1682,1168,86]]]'>The addition of “I believe,” does not soften the charge; it isa charge of larceny: <a href="/whart/2/0313-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="2 Whart. 313" data-case-ids="1830602" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0313-01">2 <em>Whar. </em>313</a>.</p>
    <p id="b209-8" data-blocks='[["BL_209.6",209,[145,1768,1173,427]]]'>The words in the 4th count are connected with the <em>innuendo, </em>that the defendant thereby meant that the plaintiff was guilty of larceny, and after verdict, are sufficient. They may import the crime of larceny without torturing them, especially when spoken in connection with the other words with which they are coupled. The whole testimony was before the jury, and they were the proper judges with what intent the words were spoken, and in what sense the defendant intended them to be understood.' The error assigned, therefore, as to the damages being assessed on all the counts, the fourth being bad, fails.</p>
    <p id="b209-9" data-blocks='[["BL_209.7",209,[938,2195,332,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
