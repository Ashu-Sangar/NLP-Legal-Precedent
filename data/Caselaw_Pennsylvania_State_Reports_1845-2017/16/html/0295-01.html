On that and the following day amicable judgments, to a large amount, were entered against them in the Common Pleas of Centre county. All of these judgments, with the exception of two or three, stipulated for a stay of execution for one year. On the 7th of December 1847, executions were issued upon the judgments of Simon Cameron <em>vs. </em>J. &amp; J. Potter, and William Allison <em>vs. </em>Same, by virtue of which the personal property of the defendants, including 165 shares of stock in the Centre and Kishacoquillas Turnpike,' was levied on and sold by the sheriff. The stock was purchased by James Burnside, Esq., who afterwards, as was admitted on the trial, received one or more dividends on the same, but no transfer was ever made to him upon the books of the corporation.</p>

To No. 5, April term 1849, an attachment execution was issued upon this judgment against J. &amp; J., Potter, with clause of scire facias to the Centre and Kishacoquillas .Turnpike Road Company, by virtue of which the 165 shares of stock above mentioned were attached in the hands of the corporation. On the trial of the case, at November term 1850; James Burnside, Esq., asked leave of the court to suggest his interest in the stock in controversy, and' be made a party defendant upon the record, <em>pro interesse suo, </em>which was granted. The plaintiff contended that notwithstanding the sale to Mr. Burnside by the sheriff, under the executions of Cameron and Allison, the stock remained liable to the attachment of the plaintiff or any other judgment creditors of J. &amp; J. Potter; that a sale under fieri facias conferred no -title upon the purchaser as against a subsequent attaching creditor. Mr. Burnside contended that by his purchase at sheriff’s sale he took a good title, even as against the present plaintiff. This was the only point in the cause.</p>

      <em>Opinion of </em>Woodward, J. — The court, after stating the positions and relations of the respective parties, proceeded to observe, that the plaintiff’s counsel insist that the act of 16th June 1836, relating to executions, supplies and repeals the act of 29th March 1819, for taking stock in execution like goods and chattels, and that there is no law to justify the levy and sale under which Mr, Burnside claims to hold the stock in question.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b296-7" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[286,1102,1172,1098]]]'>This position is .said to be supported, 1st, by the fact that the compilers of all the digests now in use omit the act of 1819, and that Mr. <em>Sergeant </em>speaks of it in his work on attachments as repealed by the law of 1836. And 2d, by the fact that the law of 1836 prescribes a mode of taking stock in execution which the legislature has said “ <em>shall” </em>be pursued, and which mode is inconsistent with the provisions of the law of 1819. As to the first of these objections, it is to be. considered that the acts of Assembly in Pennsylvania are so numerous, and touch one another at so many points, that no compiler or commentator, however learned or diligent, canj in the absence of cases, undertake to declare with any confidence what sections or parts of sections of a particular law have been supplied by subsequent legislation. It is only when cases arise, and you come to apply the subsequent law, that it can be clearly seen whether the old law be superseded or not; and therefore it is no uncommon thing to find in our modern digests acts of Assembly and parts of acts, as still in force, which in reality have been supplied’ and repealed. And the compiler is quite as likely to omit a law as repealed which is really in force, as he is to insert a law as being in force which is really repealed. While the greatest deference is felt, therefore, for the learning and industry of the compilers of our digests and the commentators on our acts of Assembly, their opinions as to what laws are in force are far from being conclusive. It remains for the courts, after all, to determine this point, as cases occur from time to time for their consideration.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b297-6" data-blocks='[["BL_297.4",297,[177,688,1173,1114]]]'>Now the 22d section of the act of 16th June 1836'seems to reenact and extend the provisions of the 1st section of the act of 1819, and in the most express terms subjects “the stock owned by any defendant in any body corporate” to execution “ like other goods or chattels.” If this section be limited to stock held in the name of the owner, it may be admitted to have superseded the 1st section of.the act of 1819; but if it be construed to embrace all stock, without regard to the mode of holding it, then, undoubtedly, it is to be taken in connection with the 32d, 33d, and 34th sections of the same act. And what is the proper construction of these sections ? The latter clause of the 32d section, and the whole of the 33d section, prescribe a mode of seizing stock, “ if it shall be held in another name than that of the real owner thereof.” That is one class of cases. Stock is often held in the name of .a trustee, the beneficial interest in which belongs to a person whose name does not appear on the books of the corporation. When that person is the debtor, the creditor has the remedy prescribed in these sections on complying with the conditions proposed. And here, let it be observed, is a system of measures provided for the very class of cases contemplated by the 3d section of the act of 1819; but which measures are inconsistent with the provisions of that section, and yet, in our later editions of Purdon’s Digest, which contains this execution law of 1836, this very 3d section of the act of 1819 is retained as being in force, while the 2d section of the act of 1819 is said to be repealed. See <em>Purdon, </em>edition of 1847— title “ Corporation.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b297-7" data-blocks='[["BL_297.5",297,[180,1804,1169,256]]]'>Now to this class of cases, where the stock is held in another <em>than the real owner’s </em>name, I apply the provisions of the 32d and 33d sections of the act of 1836, and the imperative <em>“shall,” </em>which occurs in the first clause of 32d section. In <em>such </em>cases, the proceedings “ <em>shall” </em>be by affidavit and recognizance and process in the nature of an attachment and summons to the trustee, &amp;c.</p>

The “ shall” of the 32d section cannot be applied to the cases contemplated in the 34th <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>section because the word <em>“ </em>may” is used in the latter, and excludes it.

He may consider it the most expeditious and convenient mode of testing such claimant’s right to the stack, and he is sure of getting security from the claimant before he can be admitted to defend for the interest he claims. Therefore it is that the legislature opened this mode of procedure to a creditor who wished to seize his debt- or’s stock, that stands in his own name, but is claimed by another, but they did not shut him up to this procedure, even in this case. And when the debtor holds his stock in his own name, and it is <em>not </em>claimed by another, how can it be said that he is confined to the proceedings prescribed in this section.</p>
