He said they should not keep the price of the bricks for that purpose. I was a witness in this suit before arbitrators.

    <p class="summary" id="b401-6" data-blocks='[["BL_401.4",401,[127,609,1175,1628]]]'>Gordon, President J., charged: — This is an action brought to recover the price of a quantity of brick, furnished to the defendants by John Darrah, on the order of the plaintiffs. The order is not produced, but it is agreed here that it was for about ninety dollars, and that it was drawn by McKinney, one of the firm, on John Darrah, a debtor of the firm, in the name of both the partners. From the evidence it appears that John Darrah was indebted to McKinney &amp; Ileller, and that McKinney was indebted to the defendants. The order was drawn by <em>McKinney </em>and delivered to the Brights <em>in part payment of the debt due from him to the Brights. </em>The plaintiffs in this suit allege that McKinney had no right to apply the debt due from John Darrah,' which was the property of the firm, to the payment of his own individual debt, and that such misapplication being known to the defendants, they are liable to the firm in this action for the amount^ received by them on the order. The law is, that one partner cannot apply the partnership property to the discharge of his own debts; and the creditor who receives such funds, with knowledge of the facts, is liable to repay them to the partners, in an action instituted in the partnership name. In the case before us, however, the defendants allege that Heller, the partner, had knowledge of the order drawn by McKinney on Darrah, in the name of the firm, and that although he made some objections to it in conversation with Darrah, he gave no peremptory instructions to Darrah on the subject; that he did not forbid Darrah to furnish bricks to the defendants on the order, nor give notice to the defendants of his dissent to this application of the partnership fund. These facts seem to be established by the evidence of Darrah, who has been examined here as a witness ; but whether it be or not, is for you to decide, as are all the facts of the case. If Heller knew of the order on Darrah before it was executed by Darrah, and did not give notice to the defendants of his dissent from such application of the partnership funds, he is bound by the order, and the plaintiff cannot recover. The defendants might not have been willing to take bricks on any other terms than those upon which these were understood by them to be received, and if they had been apprized of his partner’s dissent, they might have resorted to McKinney for payment of, or security for their debt.</p>

They acted at their peril and with their eyes open. With full knowledge of the circumstances they dealt with one of the partners to get their debt paid at the expense of Heller, and they now complain of want of notice that he would not consent to it. Was it necessary to give them notice that they were attempting to do him an injury ? Notice that a man will not submit to a wrong, would be absurd. The defendants had no ground to presume that Heller had authorized McKinney to draw in their favor, for there is no circumstance in the case to found a presumption, and it was their business to inquire. If they took McKinney’s word for it they must take the consequences. When told of the order before the bricks were delivered, Heller told Darrah that it was wrong. But if the defendants gave a receipt for the separate debt, or delivered up the security for it when the order was drawn, notice would have been too late to save them; and if they did not, a recovery in this suit would leave their right of recourse to McKinney intact, and the parties would be remitted to the position which justice requires them to occupy. In any aspect whatever, the defendants have no case. . Judgment reversed.</p>
