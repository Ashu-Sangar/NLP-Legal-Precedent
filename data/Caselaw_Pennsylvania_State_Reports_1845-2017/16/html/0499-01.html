Three of these bonds were assigned by John Uhrich to F. Boas, and by him to D. Krause. John Uhrich died in 1818 intestate, leaving a widow, named Magdalena, and heirs, Joseph Uhrich, the defendant, and the children of George Uhrich, another son, who are the plaintiffs. George having died before his father, letters of administration on John Uhrich’s estate were issued in February 1818 to his son Joseph Uhrich and Peter Crum, who settled an administration account, which was confirmed 4th October 1820, exhibiting a balance due to the administrators of $1161.10. This account was in the name of both the administrators, though sworn to by Peter Crum only, who then lived in Dauphin county. Joseph Uhrich, the other administrator, lived in Lancaster county. In this account a credit is asked for the thirteen bonds against Hynicka as outstanding. A judgment was obtained by D.Krause against C.Hynicka in 1818, for $1118.45, the amount of the three bonds assigned to him, on which proceedings were had, and upon a <em>venditioni exponas </em>to January term 1829, H. Chritzman, sheriff, sold the two tracts of land to Joseph Uhrich, the defendant, one tract for $410, and the other for $400, <a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>for which he acknowledged deeds to Joseph Uhrieh, January 21, 1829. An agreement was made between Joseph Uhrieh and the administrator of David Krause, that Joseph Uhrieh should hold the land purchased, four-fifths for his own use and one-fifth for the use of D. Krause’s estate; the three bonds held by D. Krause being about the one-fifth of the whole mortgage debt against Christian Hynieka. The costs of the sheriff’s sale, amounting to $73.54, were paid to the sheriff by Joseph Uhrieh and D. Krause’s administrator, and the balance of the purchase-money, amounting to $736.46, was applied in the same proportions of one-fifth and four-fifths to the mortgage bonds held by D. Krause’s administrator, and Joseph Uhrieh, as administrator of his father, John Uhrieh. Some years after this a partition was made, and Joseph Uhrieh set apart and conveyed to D. Krause’s heirs one-fifth their portion, reserving four-fifths of the land now in question for himself. Joseph Uhrieh held this land until April 1843, when he sold and conveyed it to Peter Beck for $1750, receiving $200 in cash, and taking two judgments against Peter Beck, one for $675, payable April 1,1844, and the other for $875, payable April 1, 1845, and both entered April 23, 1843, in pursuance of which Peter Beck took possession, and has held it ever since. This action of ejectment was instituted April 24, 1845, by the plaintiffs, who are the children of George Uhrieh, and claim the undivided half of this land, on the ground that it was paid for with the bonds of Hynieka, the one-half of which they allege belonged to them. On the 29th of May 1845, Peter Beck served a notice upon Joseph Uhrieh, calling upon him to appear to this action of ejectment, and defend the title under the warranty in his deed to Peter Beck; and accordingly Joseph Uhrieh did appear and make defence. In September 1845, Peter Beck obtained a rule on Joseph Uhrieh to show cause why the judgments against him above stated should not be opened, on the ground of a defect of title to the land sold to him; and on the 26th of February 1847, these judgments were opened by the court, and the defendant let into a defence, and a trial being had on the 27th of January 1848, a verdict was found for the plaintiff. The case was removed to the Supreme Court, where the judgment was reversed in July 1850, a report of which exists in 1 <em>Harris’s Rep. </em>636.</p>

This instruction altogether cut up the claim of the plaintiff in this action of ejectment, and left nothing to be considered or passed upon by the jury. But this court considered that instruction altogether wrong; and determined that Joseph Uhrich having paid for the land which he purchased, and which is in dispute, with the funds of the plaintiffs, who are the heirs of George Uhrich, deceased, who was one of the heirs of John Uhrich, deceased, he held in trust for them as to a moiety, and which was embraced in this suit, and that they were entitled to recover. This court also determined that the plaintiffs were not compelled or bound to pursue the fund in the hands of Joseph Uhrich, administrator of John Uhrich, deceased, produced by the sale, but had a right to pursue and recover the land which, by force of his purchase, was held by Joseph Uhrich in trust for them. In the reported opinion of this court it was said, incidentally, that Beck, who had purchased from Joseph Uhrich, and who was entitled to be reimbursed so far as he had paid the purchase-money, without notice, had <em>probably </em>been compensated by the rents, issues, and profits. But this court did not take that fact for granted. They sent the cause back, in order that it might be tried by a jury, under the principles of law established by this court, to wit, that Joseph Uhrich held as a trustee of a moiety for the heirs of George Uhrich, deceased. I may as well say, however, that as Beck was a mere volunteer, except so far as he had paid his money, ($200,) yet the heirs of George Uhrich were only bound to tender, or could only be held account<a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>able for, one-half that sum, as Joseph Uhrich owned one-half the land, as coheir of John Uhrich, deceased, with the heirs of'George Uhrich, his brother, and was entitled to one-half the bonds with which the part of the land he got was paid for. So that it was not necessary that the plaintiffs should show that Beck had received two hundred dollars of their money out of the rent and property, but merely that he was fully compensated for the moiety of the two hundred dollars out of the moiety of the profits. Beck received possession in 1843, and, at the time of the first trial, had probably been compensated; at all events had probably been so when the cause was in this court, and long before. This is not a case to be governed by a tender of the amount due at the time of suit brought; because Joseph Uhrich denied the trust, kept it a secret from the heirs of George Uhrich, who were minors, and whose interests he was bound to look after, as well by his office of administrator, as by the dictates of humanity and equity, and his propinquity of blood. He was their trustee of the land, and could take no profit or advantage out of the conversion of the money.</p>
