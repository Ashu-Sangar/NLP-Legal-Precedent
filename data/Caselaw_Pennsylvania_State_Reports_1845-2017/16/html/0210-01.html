His suit was commenced, as I have already stated, on the 17th of January, 1849, more than six years after all the alleged services had been performed. More than six years having elapsed, then, after the services were rendered, before the suit was brought, the plaintiff’s claim for those services is cut off and barred by the statute of limitations,.unless there is proof in the case that Michael Harbold said'or did something in his lifetime that rescues it from the statute, or takes the case out of the statute. If th.ere is any <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>such proof, it is to he found alone in the testimony of Samuel Blake, Esq. If you believe his testimony to be true, then the plaintiff’s claim is unaffected by the statute — is no more barred by it than though all the services had been rendered within six years before the suit was brought. If you disbelieve it, the plaintiff cannot recover for services, and ought not, for the statute of limitations is a wholesome act, and should not be violated, even though it should, in the opinion of the jury, work the grossest injustice. Esquire Blake testifies in regard to the point under consideration as follows. Speaking of the house in which both parties resided, he says: — “ I went to the house the last of March 1843, and remained there as a boarder, until the spring of 1848, boarding part of the time with Kuntz, and part of the time with the old man. The old man detailed to me about bringing Kuntz and his family from York county, to work on his farm, from 1831 to 1841; he said he was $2000 in debt for the farm ; that Kuntz was a great worker, and he brought him along to work on the farm; that Kuntz had a house and lot in Washington township, York county, and that he (Kuntz) told him (Harbold) that he should rent it out and pay his (Kuntz’s) little debts. He said he had never settled nor paid him for the ten years’ service, and he* did not know what he would charge him. He told me, in 1847, that he owed Kuntz for his ten years’ service ; that he had never paid him, and that he could pay him and would pay him. On the same day, he said he had not settled with him for the rent of the house and lot; that he would settle with him and pay him all he owed him; that he was old, and wanted to settle up for the ten years’ service and the rent. He told me that after the ten years he gave Kuntz the place on rent for the third bushel; Kuntz to get the third bushel. I had a settlement with the old man in February 1847, and his settlement with Kuntz was repeatedly brought up by him that day.”</p>

The acknowledgment went to the <em>entire </em>claim — the <em>whole claim </em>for ten year’s services.

    <p id="b213-6" data-blocks='[["BL_213.4",213,[151,658,1178,721]]]'>But the <em>acknowledgment </em>was accompanied by an <em>express promise to pay. </em>This promise, if the testimony of the witness is true, was as extensive as the acknowledgment, and went, like it, to the full extent-of the original demand. There is, it is true, no admission of a clear balance. There could be none, as there never had been any thing between the parties by which the amount of the balance was known to either,' but an undertaking to pay whatever the services were worth. If, one day before the statute interposed, the defendant would have been liable to pay the value of the services, to be liquidated by a jury in case of disagreement between the parties, we say that the declaration of Harbold, in 1847, “ that he owed Kuntz for his ten years’ services; that he had never paid him, and that he could pay him, and would pay him,” restored that liability to where the statute found it. Sueh a declaration, made within six years, with proof of previous service, would have made out a good case for the plaintiff. Why should it not be sufficient to reinstate his case.</p>

To say that I will settle with you, and pay you what I owe you, and all such forms of admission, are wholly uncertain, because you cannot tell what was in the mind of the person; he perhaps thought nothing was due.

The claim is for alleged services by ICuntz, his wife Susan, and his minor children. The services are alleged to have been rendered between 1831'and 1841, during which time it is also averred that Harbold received-the rent of a house belonging to Kuntz. The suit was not instituted till 1849. The court say that the testimony of Samuel Blake, if believed, removes the bar of the statute. But Blake’s testimony, thus thrown before the jury in a lump, is altogether too vague and ill-defined. We cannot ascertain whether it ivas one conversation, two, three, or more.</p>

He afterwards said that he wanted to settle up for the ten yéars’ service (but of whom he did not say) and the rent, and he would pay all he owed him. He also said he did not know how much Kuntzi would charge him. Now there is nothing certain in this. All the while Kuntz was living on the farm of Harbold, andmusthave been furnished, I should suppose, with much material for clothing and subsistence. But the witness testifies that his services were worth $150 per year. Here is a claim and a recovery to the amount of $1401, for alleged services, the last of which were rendered eight years before suit brought, and all depending upon the misty recollection of one witness, who testifies merely as to admissions, the easiest mode of testimony to lead to error, the kind of evidence most apt to be misapprehended and mistaken, and in relation to which a facile conscience may stretch itself like India rubber. At the close of his testimony, he says that Harbold told him he had paid debts for Kuntz and hauled stone. We may suppose also that he had a claim against Kuntz for occupying his premises. What then was the balance on settlement — how much, what sum was in the mind of Harbold when he said he would settle and pay what he owed ? Was it a hundred dollars, or was it two thousand ? The evidence gives no data, acknowledged and stated by Harbold, from which it can be fixed with certainty.</p>
