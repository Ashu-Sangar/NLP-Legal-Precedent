The horse died about thirty days after the sale. The purchaser did not offer to return him; but it was alleged that he believed, till shortly before the death of the horse, that he could cure him.

    <p class="summary" id="b201-9" data-blocks='[["BL_201.7",201,[144,1125,1175,246]]]'>“1. If the jury believe that the colt, for the price of which the note in controversy in this action was given, was unsound and unhealthy at the time of the sale of the colt by Martin to Shore, the law presumes that unsoundness continued, unless it had been proven that the colt recovered its health before it was sold to defendant.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b201-10" data-blocks='[["BL_201.8",201,[145,1382,1175,385]]]'>Taylor, J., charged that such presumption would be but slight in the present case, as the animal had grown to be a horse. Much of the evidence here relates to the growth, appearance, and apparent health of the animal during the period between the purchase by Shore and the purchase by Staines. You will .take into consideration the whole evidence — that which relates to the health of the colt before, at the time, and after Martin parted with it — what has been testified to in relation to the nature of its disease, &amp;c.; and thus judge whether the <em>horse </em>was sound when sold to Staines.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b201-11" data-blocks='[["BL_201.9",201,[147,1767,1172,377]]]'>“2. If the jury believe the evidence of Jacob Gehrett, one of the plaintiff’s witnesses, and that Jacob Gehrett was employed by Aaron Shore, the owner of the horse sold, as a puffer at the public sale of the colt, to bid for Aaron Shore, and that he did so bid at the sale, the sale was fraudulent and void; and as the note for which this suit is brought was given for the horse purchased at such auction, in which Jacob Grehrett so acted as a puffer for Aaron Shore, the owner of the horse sold, the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.”</p>

The evidence, as we recollect it, is that Shore had requested G-ehrett to bid for him, and not let the horse go for less than $60; that he bid to that point, and then ceased bidding; and that afterwards he was bid by Staines and others to $69.50, and at that knocked down to Staines. Taking the facts, however, to be as assumed in this point, then it <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>would follow, we agree, that the sale at the auction was fraudulent and void; and Staines could not have been compelled to take the horse, (he refusing to do so;) that Shore could not have recovered the amount for which he was struck down <em>upon the lid. </em>But it would not still follow, <em>if he afterwards did take the horse, with an after opportunity for inspection, and ratify the sale by giving his single bill with security for the price, and the horse was a sound horse and worth the money, that the single bill would be without consideration. </em>If a sound horse at a fair price was the consideration of the single bill, then, as we have already remarked, there was, <em>in point of fact, </em>no want or failure of consideration; and it is not disputed that the horse was worth the money if sound. Whether the defence set up should, therefore, avail the defendant, must depend upon your decision of the questions of fact already submitted.</p>

We held, in Pennock’s Appeal, 2 <em>Harris </em>449, that the employment of even a single puffer vitiates the sale. In the present case, the ruling judge instructed the jury that if the horse was actually worth the sum to be paid for him, the buyer got the value of his money and could not have been defrauded. The fallacy of the principle is in assuming that there is a standard of value independent of the wishes and wants of the bidders, and that every man is willing to buy by it. A man proposes to sell his horse for a fair price to another, who declines because he has no use for him, and does not choose to take the risk of getting less for him than he gave, with a certainty of losing his trouble, and the expense of keeping in the mean time; but the case would be different did the owner make it worth his while to purchase with a view to profit on a resale. What is the worth of any thing ? The apophthegm of Hudibras answers truly, “Just so much money as ’twill bring.” Aman is defrauded whenever he is incited by artful means to bid more than he otherwise would. He has a right to buy at an undervalue, where the necessities of the owner compel him to sell; and whenever the price is ever so little enhanced by a secret contrivance, he is cheated. A sale by auction presupposes a sacrifice, or at least a willingness to sell for what can be had; but should the vendor <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>stick for the last penny, it would be idle to set tbe property up, because his price could be as readily obtained at private sale. Should he, however, see fit to make the experiment, his object could be attained by directing the auctioneer not to let the property go for less than his estimate of its market value; or, if he propose to sell without reservation as to price, let him openly reserve a right to bid. For no fair purpose is the employment of a puffer necessary; and it must vitiate every sale in which recourse is had to it. Had the horse lived in this case, it would have been necessary to return or tender him to the vendor as soon as the fraud was discovered; but as there is no evidence that it was discovered till it was too late for that, the vendee’s defence was perfect without it.</p>
