On the 16th day of August 1849, a warrant was granted to John T. Hoover (the plaintiff below) for “ four hundred acres of land (unimproved) adjoining land surveyed on warrant in the name of William McPherson on the south, and on the north, east, and west, by lands of Joseph Gratz and brothers, situate partly in the county of Clearfield, and partly in the township of Snowshoe on the Mushannon creek.” In pursuance of this warrant, a survey of 406 acres and allowance was made October 4th 1849. On the 12th of October 1849, Jacob Gratz, on his own behalf and as attorney of Joseph Gratz, entered a <em>caveat </em>against the acceptance of this survey, alleging that the land applied for was not vacant, but owned by Jacob and Joseph Gratz. A hearing was had before the board, on the first Monday of January 1850, and it was decided that the surveys and patents claimed by the Gratz’s covered the land in dispute, and the survey of Hoover was placed upon the rejected files. This decision seems to have been made 7th January 1850. On the 23d of February 1850, this suit was brought.

On the 14th of September, after argument, the court discharged the rule, dismissed the plaintiff’s motion for judgment, and the defendants appeared by their counsel and pleaded “not guilty.” On the trial, the <em>plaintiff relied </em>on the title already stated.</p>

The surveying of this block of surveys, known as “ the Levy lands,” seems to have been commenced on the 21st of June 1793, and to have been continued until the 26th, when the work was completed. These surveys are all laid so as to adjoin each other, and bounded by parallel ■ lines crossed by other parallel lines, so as to throw each tract into a-rectangular form, and make the contents equal. Clement Stocker, according to the official draft, is an exterior tract, and occupies the north-east corner of the,block. On the north-east side of and adjoining this body of Levy surveys, another block of surveys was located in 1792, known as the Wallis lands, three of the exterior tracts of which, and which were alleged by the <em>defendants </em>to adjoin the Levy lands, were surveyed on warrants in the name of John Harris, Henry Harris, and Benjamin Harris. But the <em>plaintiff </em>contended that these tracts do not adjoin the Levy lands, but that, on the contrary, a vacancy was left between them, which he had a right to apply to his warrant of 1849, and this state of facts he undertook to establish by proof of the actual condition of the <em>marlcs upon the ground. </em>The defendant claimed that the Stocker survey adjoins the surveys in the name of John Harris and Henry <em>Harris; </em>and if this were so, then the Stocker survey would cover the vacancy claimed for the Hoover warrant.</p>

He further testified that if the block were so moved as to make Stocker adjoin Henry Harris, it would throw the intersection of the Mushannon with the Indian Path entirely off the leading warrant, and thus deprive it of marks which clearly identify and distinguish the Robert Morris survey. He further swears that if Stocker were made to adjoin John Yaughan, Paul Cox, Henry Harris, and John Harris, which would be placing it in its ofiicial connection, it would then contain more than 1000 acres, whereas by the return of survey it contains but 433 acres and 153 perches. Mr. Green corroborated Mr. Quay, and further stated that he examined whether there were any marks on the ground which would throw Stocker out of its official connection with Cox and Yaughan, and found none. Wm. Harris was examined, who, on behalf of the defendants testified that he never examined this block of Levy lands with a view to the proper location of the Stocker tract. He said the Clement Stocker must be located according to the official draft and the stream, so as to join the John Harris and Henry Harris, and having regard to the marks on the ground, he would say the same, because he found the line- of Henry Harris and John Harris just where Mr. Quay says he found them; that there was no dispute about them; and there he found a line from the maple to the Mushannon Creek, counting to date of survey, the line between Cox and Stocker.</p>

The burthen of proof is on the plaintiff. A body of surveys are found in the land-office, calling for each other as adjoiners, and the whole claiming to adjoin an older body ; the plaintiff has undertaken to satisfy a jury that between these bodies of surveys, professing to adjoin, there is a considerable strip of vacant land, open to his warrant of 1849. The presumptions are all against him, and are to be overcome only by full and adequate proof. It is a question of location. What is the proper location of Clement Stocker ? If it be located where the plaintiff places it, there would seem to have been vacant land where he laid his warrant. If it be located where the defendant insists it lies, there was no vacant land for the plaintiffs’ warrant, and the verdict of the jury would be for the defendant.</p>

This proposition is correct with only one qualification, and that is, that in pushing Clement Stocker to its adjoiners you do not <em>dislocate </em>any other tract of the body of which it is part. Clement Stocker is one of a body of surveys, and while its calls must, if possible, be all answered, yet we must not forget that it maintains on the ground certain relations to other tracts, and the rights of property in them are not to be disturbed, and a scene of universal litigation introduced, merely to satisfy one of the calls of Clement Stocker.

He thinks there was no adequate evidence of marks on the ground to be left to the jury as restraining the survey on the “Henry Harris” side, and as on the north the “John Harris” was found and indisputably fixed, the call ceased to be equivocal; wherefore the instruction should have been that in the absence of restraining marks found on that side, the jury was bound to. accept the southern line .of the last-mentioned tract as the true boundary of the one in controversy. But in this we cannot concur. Notwithstanding the long acquiescence in the drafts of surveys returned to and filed in the surveyor-general’s office, it is undoubted that actual indications of the lines originally run on the ground are the best evidence of the true location sought for ; and as there was, to say the least of it, some proof of such indications in the surveyor’s marks testified to by Quay and Green, the court had no choice other than to submit to the jury what was properly matter of fact for its determination. To the other branch of the objection, the answer is found in the obvious meaning of the surveyor’s return, that although he was aware a tract had been located in the immediate neighborhood in the name of John Harris, he had not taken upon himself to ascertain exactly where that tract lay. It might join the “ Clement Stocker” on that side, or the land there might be vacant. This was the interpretation given below, and we think the correct one.</p>
    <p id="b239-6" data-blocks='[["BL_239.4",239,[129,1642,1172,774]],["BL_240.1",240,[296,390,1174,1282]]]'>The other exception principally urged was that taken to the admission of what is known as the book of the treasurer of Centre county, containing lists of unseated lands situate in that county liable to taxation. The defendant below claimed that the Stocker tract was situate principally on the east side of the Mushannon Creek, which there divides Centre and Clearfield counties; while the location assigned to it by the plaintiff below threw the greater portion of it to the west side of the stream. It seems the custom in that district of country is to levy the tax of unseated tracts of land in that county in which the larger part of it may be found to lie. In this discussion as to locality, it became of importance to show in which of the counties the larger portion of the disputed tract actually is. As one means of making this manifest, the plaintiff below offered the deposition of the treasurer of Clearfield county; but it was objected, the best evidence of the unseated lands' returned in Clearfield for taxation was the treasurer’s book. The court was of this opinion, and accordingly rejected the deposition. After this, the book of the treasurer of Centre, being duly proved, <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>was received, to show the Stocker tract was not returned for taxation in Centre, although most of the other tracts of that survey were so returned; the former, with three others, having in fact been transferred from Centre to Clearfield. It is objected that, at best, this was the work of the treasurer himself, without reference to the owner, whose interests were therefore not liable to be affected by it. But we cannot admit this transfer of his lands for the purposes of taxation was a subject with which the owner was wholly unconnected. By the act of March 1806, it is made the duty of the owners of unseated lands to return a statement of them to the commissioners of the proper county ; a duty to which it is not to be doubted the Messrs. Gratz had given their attention. It is not to be supposed that of their own mere motion the commissioners or treasurer of Centre would have assigned these tracts to Clearfield, and as the owners had regularly paid the taxes assessed upon them, it cannot be questioned they were cognizant of the fact. Indeed, I find in the paper-book of the plaintiff in error, the deposition of John G. Lowry, taken after notice, in proceedings relative to the tracts, before the board of property, and read on the trial of this cause. Mr. Lowry was treasurer of Centre county from 1829 to 1843, and also in the years of 1846 and 1841. He testified he presumed the transfer of the four tracts from Centre to Clearfield was made in pursuance of directions from Jacob Gratz; that no taxes for these four tracts had been paid in Centre since 1835; and that Mr. Gratz had furnished to the witness, as treasurer, a corrected list of their lands in Centre for the years 1848 and 1849, in which the Stocker tract did not appear. With this deposition, it will not be questioned the treasurer’s book was properly received, and without it, I think it was good evidence, under the circumstances, of the fact sought to be proved.</p>
    <p id="b240-6" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[294,1672,1170,598]]]'>The remaining errors, but faintly pressed on the argument, are sufficiently answered by the printed remarks submitted for the defendant in error, except the tenth, which is not there noticed. It avers the court erred in refusing to set aside the service of the writ of summons issued in this case. Were this now assigned as error, the record presents no ground upon which the court could with propriety have interfered with that service. The sheriff’s return is regularly made of a regular service, and there is absolutely nothing to contradict it or to call it into question. As for the bill of exceptions signed on the hearing of the rule to show cause, because of the rejection of Sheriff Musser’s testimony, by which it was intended to contradict the return, it is enough to say it is a mere nullity. The notion of an exception to evidence on a preliminary inquiry is indeed novel.</p>
