The plaintiff was the owner of a house and lot in Lancaster, and married Jacob Weishlee, who owned another house and lot in the same city. On the 15th Oct. 1846, she joined her husband in a mortgage on her house to Christian Habacker, to secure a debt of $500 due from her husband. On the 26th April 1847, she joined her husband in another mortgage, to secure another debt of her husband, of $1400, which ivas due to John Hatz. This mortgage included both houses and lots, as well that of her husband, as the one which belonged to her. On the 1st Dec. 1848, Jacob Sheidle, the defendant, puréhased of Jacob Weishlee the house and lot which belonged to him, and received a deed from Weishlee and wife, for the consideration stated in the deed, of $1700, At the time of executing this deed a sum, in the neighborhood of $300, ivas paid by Sheidle to the husband, Weishlee, in the presence of the plaintiff, which was expressed, at the time and in her presence, to be the balance, deducting the mortgage or lien of John Hatz, which Sheidle, the purchaser, was to pay. The mortgage of Habacker not being paid, the plaintiff’s property was sold by the sheriff, by virtue of proceedings thereon, and on the 7th Eeb. 1850, the sheriff paid into court the sum of $565.48, arising from the sale of the plaintiff’s house and lot aforesaid. Out of this sum the court directed the sum of $175.38 to be paid on the mortgage of John Hatz, which was all that was <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>claimed. It is alleged that the <em>principal </em>of the mortgage debt has been adjusted by the defendant, and this sum was the arrearages of <em>interest </em>due Qn the mortgage.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b137-6" data-blocks='[["BL_137.4",137,[146,521,1173,1888]],["BL_138.1",138,[295,386,1167,87]]]'>When Elizabeth Weishlee joined her husband in the mortgage to John Hatz, to secure the debt of her husband, she became entitled to all the rights of a surety as against her husband: she had a right to insist on the sale of his own house and lot, to pay his own debt, before resorting to her property included in the mortgage. And in case she was compelled to pay the debt to Hatz, or any part of it, she was entitled to subrogation <em>pro tanto, </em>and had a right to enforce the Hatz mortgage against her husband’s house and lot. In equity, her husband was bound to pay the debt, and his .property stood pledged for that purpose. She had a right to take his house and lot into consideration when she entered into the mortgage, and it is presumed that its inclusion in the mortgage formed an inducement with her to become bound in the mortgage. This being the nature of her rights, at the time of' becoming her husband’s surety to Hatz, what circumstances have deprived her of her equitable claim ? When Sheidle, the defendant, purchased the house and lot of her husband, the Hatz mortgage was upon'record, and it appeared upon the face of it, that it was given to secure a debt of Jacob Weishlee, and that Elizabeth Weishlee was but a surety. Not only was the purchaser affected with <em>constructive </em>notice of the mortgage, but it appears from the evidence of the subscribing witnesses to his deed, that he had <em>actual </em>notice of it, and that he only paid about $300, retaining the residue of 'the consideration-money, and agreeing to pay the mortgage to Hatz. The money which was paid (except a $5 gold-piece to the wife for signing the deed) was paid to Jacob Weishlee himself. The plaintiff received no part of it. So that there is nothing in this to postpone her. She must be presumed to have signed' the deed upon the inducements made known to her; and when it was mentioned in her presence, by the .parties, that the defendant was to pay off the Hatz mortgage, she could have no reason for withholding her signature. On the contrary, this agreement would necessarily operate on her mind as an inducement to execute the conveyance, because by the proceeding she would be relieved from the Hatz mortgage. But it is complained that the defendant mistook the amount of that mortgage — that is, that he did not know that any <em>interest </em>was in arrears upon it. This was his own fault, and he cannot throw the loss upon the plaintiff. There is no evidence that she deceived him in regard to it, or even that she had any knowledge herself of the arrears of interest due. On the whole, we see nothing in the • case to deprive her of her equity as surety to the extent of the sum of $175.38, which she has been compelled to pay. She is entitled, under the evidence, to recover that sum, with interest from the 23d March 1850, when <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>it was paid for the use of this defendant in discharge of the Hatz mortgage upon his property.</p>
