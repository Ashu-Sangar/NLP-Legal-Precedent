When, by such special warrant, they had appropriated an island, it was excepted from the general proprietary estate, which was vested in the commonwealth by virtue of the act of the 27th of November 1779. This island was not so specially appropriated, and by that act became vested in the commonwealth. The commonwealth, pursuing the same policy, did not, by any law, subject the island to appropriation, either by office right or settlement; but by an act of Assembly in 1795, directed the islands in several of the rivers to be sold at public sale, or otherwise, for the best prices that could be gotten for the same, and declaring that all occupancy and every survey, claim, or pretence for holding the same islands by any other title, should be utterly void. The act of 1793 still continued the sale of islands, limiting a price under which they could not be had, and provided for the appointment of appraisers, to ascertain their value, on the application of a purchaser, and giving a pre-emption right to improvers for two years from the passage of the act. The right of purchase granted to improvers was confined' to improvers cultivating the land when the act passed. The object of the legislature always was to sell islands for the best price; and by the act of 1793, to prefer an improver, if he applied within the two years ; but if he did not, then to grant it to the first applicant, subject to the regulations and conditions contained in the act. An occupation by cultivating an island for any number of years, where the commonwealth has not parted with her interest, cannot make title to the occupant. The limitation does not run against the commonwealth, and such occupation does not prevent' any citizen from applying and purchasing from the commonwealth an island not previously applied for. The only indulgence given to occupants was for two years from the passage of the act of 1793. In this case, from any thing that appears from the evidence, John M. Davidson had the right to make the application he did, and to purchase from the commonwealth; and the application, appraisement, warrant, survey, and patent, given in evidence, make him a good title to the island, and one upon which he will be entitled to recover in this case, provided you shall find that the island for which he took out his warrant is within the boundaries of this county. The territory composing Huntingdon county was erected into a separate county before the erection of Mifflin county. Mifflin county was erected in 1789, and was to include the lands lying within bounds and limits described in the act, and among them is the following description from where it runs from Franklin county — “ thence along the said line to the Huntingdon county line; thence along the said line to the Juniata river; thence up the said river to Jack’s Narrows.” It is in the river, at this line of boundary, the island in dispute is situated.

But this, although it is required in the statute, was designed to answer a particular purpose, to wit, to inform the government whether any one was entitled to the preemption under the act of Assembly permitting the appropriation of islands. In this case, the two years during which the preemption was to run had expired long before the application ; and therefore, as regarded the commonwealth, it was of no moment that they should be described, because the island, was to be valued by persons appointed, who would of course take into consideration the value of the improvements. The commonwealth, after valuation of the island, and after all the preliminary steps except the one of describing the improvements in the application, had been duly taken, granted a patent to Davidson in March 1841. This closed up the matter, and, as far as the commonwealth was concerned, vested the title in the plaintiff below; and this disposes of the first bill of exceptions. The second bill covers exceptions to evidence of assessments of the island in dispute, by the authorities of Huntingdon county offered for the purpose of showing that the island did lie in Huntingdon county, and that therefore the court in Mifflin county had no jurisdiction of the cause. But the lines and boundaries of counties are fixed by statute, and the power is not given to the commissioners or other officers of a county to restrain or expand those boundaries. Whether the assessments were made for a long or short period is of little importance, because local usage or trespass can never repeal positive statutory law. The third and fourth bills of exceptions are disposed of by the same rule and reason which governs the second. The proceedings of the Orphans’ Court of Huntingdon county, even if they were properly certified, would not conduce to establish the line of Huntingdon county, or to restrain or limit the line of Mifflin county or oust the jurisdiction of its courts.</p>

The improvement therefore on the island, being merely an extension of the improvement of Johns on the mainland in Huntingdon county, vested no title in the said Johns to the island. The law of actual settlement and improvement was never extended <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>to islands. The sixth bill of exceptions to evidence is closely allied to those considered already. Testimony of assessments in Huntingdon county for twenty-eight years might perhaps be admitted, if the actual location of the line was uncertain, had been obliterated, or had never been surveyed or marked. In such case the assessments for a long period of time might conduce, in the absence of better evidence, to show where the line originally was. But here the line is well known, neither defaced nor shifted by time or accident. It is the Juniata river. And the real question is whether the statute makes the southern bank or shore or the middle of the river the true boundary between Mifflin and Huntingdon counties, as far as it is the boundary. That is a question of law.</p>
    <p id="b521-6" data-blocks='[["BL_521.4",521,[130,899,1181,1029]]]'>Mifflin county was erected out of Cumberland and Northumberland counties. At that time Mifflin embraced the county of Juniata within its limits, which was since erected into a separate county; but that affects not the question here, as the conflicting jurisdiction is between Mifflin in its present limits and Huntingdon. The line of old Mifflin crossed the Juniata and took in a large portion of territory on the eastern and southern side of it; and then intersecting the line of Huntingdon county on the southern side of the river, the statute proceeds as follows: “ Thence along the said Huntingdon county line <em>to </em>Juniata river, thence up said river to Jack’s Narrows,” &amp;c. Between Jack’s Narrows and where the line of Mifflin strikes the river, lies the island in dispute. It was contended here, and also in the court below, that the middle of the stream was the true boundary; and the court below seemed to be’ of that opinion, but left it to the jury to say whether part of the island was not on the side nearest the Mifflin shore ; and that if that was the case, the Mifflin county court had jurisdiction, under a statute which prescribes that when land lies partly in one county and partly in another, either county has jurisdiction to try title to the whole. But we are of opinion that the jurisdiction of Mifflin county over the island does not depend upon so uncertain a line. We are of opinion that the whole bed of the river and the islands in it, from where the line strikes the southern shore of the stream up to Jack’s Narrows, is in Mifflin county.</p>

And islands in the middle of the stream or close to the shore of either side follow the same rule and are governed by it. This rule has been adopted in several of the states, New York among the number. In the case of Canal Commissioners <em>v. </em>The People, <a href="/wend/5/0423-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="5 Wend. 423" data-case-ids="2145676" data-case-paths="/wend/5/0423-01">5 <em>Wend. </em>423</a>, it was held that by the rule of the common law which was adopted in that state, grants of lands, bounded on rivers above tide water, extended <em>usque ad </em>

      <em>filum </em>aqux, including beds of rivers and islands, but subject to the right of the public to use the waters as a highway. But this rule was never adopted in Pennsylvania. By the act of 1785, appropriating lands in the new purchase, islands were excepted from its provisions, and they were to be sold by special order of the government; and by the act of 1793 the mode of disposing of islands in the Susquehanna and its branches is provided for. By a late act of Assembly the land officers were authorized to issue warrants for land under the beds of certain western rivers, and many warrants. were issued under the act. In Pennsylvania, wherever a stream is navigable, and it is made the boundary of a grant by the State, the title passes to low-water mark, but no farther.</p>
