He then lived in Pottsville. I think the valuation of his real estate was after that about $30,000. In 1842, sold his personal property, as deputy sheriff. He had considerable personal property ; the return of the sheriff was $1200 to $1400. I think up to some time in July, 1842, he was in business very largely, in the mill and lumbering business. I think there is no doubt Audenried had the ability to pay $500 in 1841 and the first six months of 1842; I think he was always able to pay double that amount in the fall of 1840, almost any hour. (On cross-examination.) I did not collect any of Audenried in the fall of 1840. I did not see him pay any debts in the fall of 1840. I recollect seeing him have money in the fall of 1840. I do not believe Audenried was worth a single dollar in the fall of 1840, after paying his debts. Within the last year Audenried was doing business, I don’t think any one suspected him of being much in debt, although a general borrower; I loaned him about the middle of August, 1842. He broke up about that time.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b11-7" data-blocks='[["BL_11.6",11,[146,930,1177,1072]]]'>The defendant contends he is not liable, upon the ground that the plaintiffs have not used that due and legal diligence to collect the amount from the principal, Audenried, wrhich the law requires. This leads us to consider, first, the character of this guaranty, to wit, whether the same is absolute or qualified. From the terms of this guaranty, we cannot distinguish it from a common and ordinary undertaking of guaranty, and consequently the same rules are applied to it which are applicable to cases of this description, among which are, that the holder shall use due and reasonable diligence to obtain payment from the debtor, and, in case of non-payment, give reasonable notice to the guarantor, except in cases where the debtor is insolvent when the instrument becomes due. The single bill became due on the 25th of July, 1840. There is no evidence of any judgments against Audenried until about two years after the debt became due. There is no evidence that an effort was made to collect it from him, or that Pott had notice of its non-payment before the bringing of this suit on the 18th August, 1845. It is for you to determine whether Audenried was insolvent and unable to pay when this debt was due. If he was, the plaintiffs were not bound to pursue him or seek to obtain their claim; and, in this case, it would have been necessary for them to give the defendant notice of its non-payment. If he was not insolvent at that time, nor for some time afterwards, they should have used due and reasonable diligence to collect it from the debtor, and, on failure to obtain it, have given Pott reasonable notice of it.</p>

There is no evidence that Pott was notified of its non-payment before suit was brought. If you are satisfied that Audenried was insolvent when it became due, or that the plaintiffs have used due diligence, your verdict should be for plaintiffs for the amount of their claim. If you are not so satisfied, your verdict should be for the defendant.

It is necessary that he should do some act to warn the holder of the instrument and put him on his guard. Such as giving him notice to proceed against the principal. Nothing of that kind is pretended here. The only feasible ground on which Pott can stand is that he was a technical guarantor and not a surety. The rule on that subject is that the intent of the parties, as collected from the language of the instrument, and the attending circumstances of the execution, furnish the true test and guide of interpretation as to the character of the obligation. The language of endorsement seems to be plain enough: “I hereby acknowledge to be security for the within amount of $500, until satisfactorily paid by Vm. Audenried.” The word <em>security </em>has an established and well-known meaning in the minds of most people, and indicates an obligation to stand for the sum absolutely, unless discharged by the supine negligence of the obligor after notice. It is in broad contrast with the word guaranty, which imports a conditional liability, if due steps are taken against the principal. Beside, Pott agrees to be surety until the sum is satisfactorily paid by Audenried, which effectually excludes the conclusion that he was to be discharged by Audenried’s inability to pay. The error of the court consisted in assuming that Audenried’s liability was the common undertaking of guaranty, and that the plaintiff was bound to have shown that he used due diligence to recover the amount from Audenried before he could pursue Pott. We think his obligation imported the liability of a surety, that it was unqualified by the condition of a guaranty. That the plaintiff was not bound to give notice to Pott of the non-payment by Audenried at its maturity. And that Pott, to insure his own discharge from his obligation, was bound to show that he had given the plaintiff notice to proceed against Audenried. That mere delay to sue Audenried by the plaintiff did not discharge Pott.</p>
