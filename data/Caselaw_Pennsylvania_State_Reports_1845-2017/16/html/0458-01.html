At this time, June 1, 1841, John Fox, sheriff of said county, was in possession of said premises under a verbal agreement between the said attorney and Henry Peffer, <em>cleric to said county commissioners. </em>The object in leasing the property was to provide a dwelling-house for the sheriff and his family. The rent for the year 1841-2 was paid; the clerk to ■ the commissioners' notified the said attorney, prior to the expiration of said lease, that the commissioners did not want the house after April 1, 1842.

    <p class="summary" id="b460-8" data-blocks='[["BL_460.6",460,[301,766,1169,257]]]'>The evidence shows that when the old jail was about to be removed and a new one built, the commissioners, under a mistaken idea that they were bound to furnish a residence for the sheriff and his family, leased a house from the plaintiff for one year, commencing on the 1st of April 1841, at a rent of $125, payable quarterly.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b460-9" data-blocks='[["BL_460.7",460,[301,1024,1170,343]]]'>In that lease they covenant to give up possession on the 1st of April 1842. Prior to that time, according to the evidence of Mr. Peffer, they instructed him to notify plaintiff’s agent that they would not want the premises that year, and received for answer that the notice was too late, it then being some time in the month of January. The tenant of the commissioners, Mr. Pox, continued in possession till the following fall; and it does not appear that even then any restoration of the premises took place.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b460-10" data-blocks='[["BL_460.8",460,[301,1367,1167,169]]]'>Under ordinary circumstances, this would amount to a continuation of the former lease for another year at the same rent: when the tenant holds over after the expiration of his term, the law implies a new lease, at the same rent, and on the same conditions.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b460-11" data-blocks='[["BL_460.9",460,[302,1537,1168,299]]]'>But it is objected here that the suit cannot be sustained on the old lease. This is true, but as the narr. is lost, we cannot tell for what the party has declared, but take it for granted the special facts are set forth. He might so declare, and the counsel says that he has set forth the lease and its continuance for another year o'n the same terms, and also has a count for not delivering up the premises according to contract.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b460-12" data-blocks='[["BL_460.10",460,[301,1837,1167,341]]]'>The defendant also says that the implied contract to continue another year on the same terms is repelled by the notice that they would not hold longer than till the 1st of April following. Notice to that effect is of no importance whatever against the act of holding over. Had the possession been delivered up on the 1st of April, the plaintiff would have had no claim, whether notice of the intention was served or not; and not being restored, the plaintiff can recover, notwithstanding the notice.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b460-13" data-blocks='[["BL_460.11",460,[301,2179,1166,216]],["BL_461.1",461,[110,384,1173,516]]]'>It is also urged that the commissioners transcended their power in leasing the premises at all; that they were not bound to find the sheriff a residence, and their act was void. It is very certain that they were not bound to find a residence for the sheriff, and the county auditors might have charged them with the money paid <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>out; but that can make no kind of difference to the person contracting with them. The plaintiff was not bound to inquire under what arrangement with the sheriff they had agreed to furnish the house, or even for what purpose it was to be furnished; for aught she would know, they were under contract to do so; nor was she bound to inquire for what purpose her premises were rented. If informed that it was for an illegal purpose, she could not enforce the contract; but barely receiving information that it was for a residence for the sheriff, would not be sufficient, as she had a right to presume the commissioners were acting in the line of their duty, and that the contract was made for some purpose beneficial to the county.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b461-6" data-blocks='[["BL_461.4",461,[116,901,1168,171]]]'>It is also argued that the county is not bound by an implied contract, and this lease being made under the private seal of the commissioners, and not under the county seal is not obligatory, especially as the county has not had the benefit of the possession.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b461-7" data-blocks='[["BL_461.5",461,[113,1073,1172,848]]]'>The mere form of the contract with a corporation is not now considered of much importance: they may be sued for torts or on verbal promises made by their accredited officers or agents, or upon implied contracts. The bargain made was binding for the first year as an express contract, and the possession not being delivered up on the 1st of April as agreed, it is binding the second year, as an implied one. If this was a suit <em>for use and occupation, </em>it would not be sustained, as the occupancy was not by the county nor for its benefit. If it appeared from the evidence that the plaintiff or her agent knew that the property was rented by the commissioners under a mistake of the law, she could not recover; or if she had notice of the purpose and object for which it was rented, she was bound to know the law, and would have no valid claim; but she was not bound to know the facts or to inquire of the commissioners under what arrangement with the sheriff they were about to rent her house, or whether it was for a purpose beneficial to the county or otherwise. On the whole facts proved, and about which there is no dispute, we are of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the rent for the year 1842, as claimed, with interest from the time it fell due.</p>
