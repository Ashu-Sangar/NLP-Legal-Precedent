This is very clearly decided in Myers’s Assignee <em>v. </em>White, <a href="/rawle/1/0353-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Rawle 353" data-case-ids="1819337" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0353-01">1 <em>Rawle </em>353</a>, and Stambaugh <em>v. </em>Yeates, 2 <em>id. </em>161.</p>

    <p id="b181-7" data-blocks='[["BL_181.5",181,[138,658,1176,986]]]'>The 119th section of the act of 16th June 1836, relating to executions, provides “ that if any lands or tenements shall be sold on execution as- aforesaid, which at the time of such sale or after-wards shall be held or possessed by a tenant or lessee, or person holding,” &amp;e., “ the purchaser, on receiving the deed, shall be deemed the landlord of such tenant, lessee, or other person, and shall have the like remedies to recover any rents,” &amp;c., “as such defendant might have had if no such sale had been made.” It is very evident that the legislature intended to authorize an eviction only when the person in possession held as purchaser by title subsequent to the judgment; and to give the purchaser at sheriff’s sale, only the rights of the landlord, when the defendant was out of possession, and the land farmed by a tenant. Certainly, such lease or tenancy must be <em>bona fide, </em>and not made to defraud .the mortgage in anticipation of a sale. Here no such fraud is found or pretended. It would be ruinous to hold that property, which had been mortgaged for five or ten years, could not be rented, or grain raised by a tenant, because possibly the mortgagees might sue out a scire facias, and, in two months after grain was sowed, sell on a levari facias, and seize the crops of the tenant. By such doctrine the mortgagor would be deprived of the profits of his property, while it was uncertain whether his creditor- would sell him out; and the cultivation of the soil would be greatly discouraged.</p>
    <p id="b181-8" data-blocks='[["BL_181.6",181,[139,1645,1173,512]]]'>But even if the purchaser could have terminated this lease on notice, it was not done here. On the 1st April after the sale, the purchaser’s vendee took possession of the balance of the property, the tenant still holding the eight acres so far as was necessary to protect the grain and harvest it. <em>He had in fact never resided on the property, renting only the field in question. </em>If therefore the sheriff’s vendee had any claim, it was only as landlord entitled to the rent agreed on by the mortgagor. If it be averred that the rent was paid in advance, that can make no difference, as it was paid according to the terms of the lease. This point was well considered and decided in the Bank <em>v. </em>Ege, <a href="/watts/9/0436-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Watts 436" data-case-ids="1850048" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0436-01">9 <em>Watts </em>436</a>.

After payment of the rent, and sowing of the crop, by the tenant, the estate of the landlord was sold by the sheriff under the prior judgment. The purchaser, and not the tenant, is entitled to the growing crop.”</p>

In this case, however, the cropper or tenant cut and carried away the whole crop, and claimed it because he had paid the rent in advance; thus disavowing the act of Assembly as for his benefit. But his lease being after the judgment and levy, and there being no severance by a sale, the purchaser’s right was absolute.</p>
