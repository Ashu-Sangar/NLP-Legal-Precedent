Deponent observed it was extraordinary, as Samuel Murray had left a will and left the property to his two daughters. She said that Fanny should have it, but Nancy should have none of it; and inquired the best course to pursue to enable her to hold the property, or have it for the youngest daughter.

On the written title, as exhibited in evidence, at law, it is beyond doubt plaintiffs are entitled to recover. A regular title to the premises is deduced to them. The defendant, however, insists that the deed of Samuel Murray, under whom plaintiffs claim, was without valuable consideration, and upon a trust understood as declared at the time, that Delia Chase should hold the property for the use of Samuel Murray for his life, and after his death for his children, &amp;c. On .this point evidence was given, the plaintiff, however, contending that the deed was made for a valuable consideration, that a bond was given as part of the purchase-money for $800. Whether the deed was given for a valuable consideration, or without consideration, or whether the evidence sustained the allegation of a parol trust, becomes a matter of minor importance, as, in a subsequent part of the charge, the court in substance instructed the jury that even admitting the deed to be voluntary <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>and without consideration, and that a parol trust was declared at the time the deed was executed, yet if it was intended as a fraud on creditors, the defendant is left without defence. Whether the instruction of the court in this particular be correct, is the only point in the case worthy of consideration.</p>

Whether the evidence shows a trust does not enter into the óonsideration of this case.' For the purposes of this point, that must be conceded, the charge proceeding on the concession that the trust is satisfactorily proved.</p>
    <p id="b57-6" data-blocks='[["BL_57.5",57,[141,872,1184,812]]]'>If there be a point settled on reason and authority, it is that a deed intended to defraud creditors, although void as against creditors, yet is valid as against the grantor, and those for whose beneT fit it is designed, whether it be the grantor himself, his child or' children, or a stranger. The grantee holds the property as against_ the fraudulent grantor and his beneficiaries, the latter being con-. sidered in the light of volunteers, without consideration, and consequently placed in no better situation tha,n the grantor, discharged from all secret trusts whether in writing or by parol. The distinction taken by the judge, I agree, is not sound, as, whether the declaration of trust be by parol or in writing, the rule is the same. That a trust cannot be enforced when it is designed to effect a fraud on creditors is settled by authority. The cases without exception decide that such a trust is void in itself, and therefore incapable of being made the foundation of a right in others : Carroll <em>v. </em>Boston Marine Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Mass.%20517" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Mass. 517">8 <em>Mass.

But this is a mistaken view of the situation of the parties. It would not hold a moment had we a court of chancery. But although we have no separate court for the administration of equity, yet we grant relief, not, it is true, in the same form, but on the same principles as courts of equity. Equity in this State is the same as in England, a principle acknowledged in repeated decisions. In the case in hand, the defence is not a legal, but an equitable defence, the defendant alleging that although the deed purports to be <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>.an absolute deed in fee simple, yet it was intended in trust for the grantor and others. It is not the plaintiff that aslcs the aid of the court, hut the defendant. The plaintiff’s title is good. At law, the defendant has no defence whatever. Were the case in equity on bills for an injunction, by which mode only would-the defendant be entitled to retain the possession, the chancellor would refuse relief when it appeared that defendant who asked the aid of the court had been guilty of a fraud in attempting to screen his property from the just claims of creditors. The chancellor would refuse to interfere. He would leave the party to his remedy at' law, where the plaintiff would be entitled to recover on the well-settled principle that although the deed was void as to creditors, yet the title <em>is valid as between the parties.</em>

If it were, it would nullify the rule. All that would be necessary would be for the fraudulent grantor either to retain the possession himself, or to give the possession to his children or other beneficiaries named in the parol or written trust.</p>
    <p id="b58-7" data-blocks='[["BL_58.5",58,[290,1223,1172,986]]]'>The rule is founded in policy. The reason is extracted from one of the cases cited, which is correctly given by the judge. Courts "of justice do not sit to extricate a rogue from his toils. To enable a party to show a secret trust in the face of an absolute deed, the purpose must have been an honest one, else, by secret fraudulent device, a dishonest man would be sure never to lose, and he has the chance of gaining. He may accomplish his fraudulent design, and then he is sure to get back his property, or what is the same thing, keep it for his family. This would be affording encouragement to such frauds. On the contrary, it is the policy of common sense and common law to environ a person with all possible perils, and to make it appear that honesty is the best policy. The court left the question of fraud to the jury, taking a distinction between a declaration of trust in writing or by parol, which, although erroneous, is an error in favor of the defendant, of which he cannot complain. That the deed from Samuel Murray to Delia Chase was intended to delay, hinder, and defraud creditors, was abundantly proved. Indeed it does not appear to be denied by the defendant. That the deed was executed under a mistaken apprehension that he would be made liable as bail, is nothing. That he was unwise may be admitted, but that is no reason for overruling the plain principles of law. Hard cases, appealing to the sympathy of a judge, make bad precedents.</p>

To reverse now on that ground (supposing there is anything in the distinction) would be to reverse for an error which the court did not commit, to which their attention was not directed.</p>
