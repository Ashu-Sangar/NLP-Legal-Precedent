Don’t recollect exactly when it was. It was written in the parlor by a brother of Ezra Blythe. Uncle David, Uncle Ezra, and Mr. Samuel Louden were present. I was living there at the time. I was in my aunt’s bed-room, and Uncle Ezra came in, and asked her to sign the mortgage. He had it not with him. She refused; told him he was aware of her unwillingness to do it; that she had told him before that she would not put her name to it, and that she was determined that she would not. Uncle still insisted, and turned away apparently agitated; replied that if she did not, he would not live on the property with her, and went out; and the brother who wrote the mortgage came in and insisted upon her signing it. I can’t tell what he said to her. She told him that she had told him when he was writing the mortgage that it was of no use, for she would not put her name to it. He offered her his glasses, and asked her if the light was sufficient. She again replied, that it was of no use, that she never intended to put her name to it. He insisted on it again and again. She was in bed. She got up and stood by the side of the bureau, and put her name to it. She then took the pen, and gave it a dash as if to strike out her name. I was not close enough to look at the mortgage. He then left the room, and came back in a few moments with Esquire Grayson. Esquire Grayson asked her if she had put her name to the mortgage with her own free will and consent. She said, Mr. Grayson, it is of no use to deceive you; I had no will in the business; my will was not consulted. He then asked her a second question, one of the same meaning, referring to her signing <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>the deed. She said she had not done it of her own free will. Then he asked her if she was afraid of being misused or beaten by Uncle Ezra, or if she had been misused by him. She replied, that uncle had not done that, neither did she fear it; that she had been pressed into it against her will. Mr. Grayson and uncle then went out into the passage, where I heard them whispering, but could not tell what they said. There was no writing done after the justice came into the room. Esquire Grayson did not write any thing that I saw. Aunt was part of the time in the parlor, and part in the bed-room, when the mortgage was being written. Cousin Adeline Massey was in the parlor after the mortgage was written, while the men were yet there. Don’t remember that any thing was said between my uncle and aunt while in the parlor. They said something about signing the mortgage; I don’t remember what it was. My aunt was in tears most of the time. She was lying on the bed when Esquire Grayson was there. She was in great sorrow, and had been for some days before. She manifested it by tears. <em>It was about dush; a candle was lighted. </em>They were there all the afternoon in the other room, to do the writings. Her health was not very good.</p>

She replied that she was willing that all her personal property should be sold to pay all the debts of the firm, but she was not willing to sign a mortgage for the house and lot, even for one day, for she felt certain that he would be disappointed in lifting it at the time expected.

By the common law the wife’s land could be aliened only with her assent, deliberately expressed, on a fair, full, and careful separate examination in a eourt of record. The condition of real property under the provincial government, its common transfer, as an article of trade and barter, with but little form, and the want of judicial tribunals, induced a departure in this State from the requirements of the common law for the protection of a wife in the alienation of her lands, and substituted the form of acknowledgment which by legislative enactment was confirmed and provided for in February 1770. Whatever the policy or exigency may have been that induced the relaxation of the law for the protection of the rights of <em>feme coverts </em>in their real estate, it is not creditable to our jurisprudence or to the intelligence of the times, that, with all the abuses of the exercise of the power by which a wife is divested of her real estate, and which so notoriously prevail, it should not have led to some legislative amendment of the law, providing for the protection of the wife, by a shield that had in it some substance. So great is marital influence, and the defenceless condition of the wife, that it is a rare case that she has firmness and independence to resist, for any length of time, the importunity of a rapacious husband. Whilst she has a husband for her protection against the world, she has, by the law of Pennsylvania, a most inefficient protection against the influence and control of 'her husband, who has her confidence and the keeping of her will. It is said by Justice Gibson, in Watson <em>v. </em>Mercer, 6 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>50, that “ the policy of the law should be as far as possible to narrow rather than widen the field of this controlling influence.”</p>

He is the commissioner and organ of the law, intrusted with the duty of seeing that it is her act and deed, and that she did voluntarily and of her own free will and accord, without any coercion or compulsion of her husband, sign, &amp;c. His duty is an important one to the wife and her representatives ; and it is a responsible one to the public, who are interested that the law be faithfully administered. We cannot cast into oblivion our knowledge that this duty is often, by justices of the peace, and sometimes by other judicial officers, as has been said, “ hurried over almost in the presence of the husband.” And when the examination is out of the presence of the husband, the justice seems to think, he has only to read over, in a hurried manner, the prepared form of acknowledgment which he has in his hand, and if open resistance is not made by the dependent wife, the acknowledgment is certified in due form, with all its particulars. There is no free and searching inquiry by the magistrate as to the free will and consent with which she is parting with her estate to satisfy the demands of an improvident and importunate husband. The law intends that he should do what is enjoined, and he certifies, under his hand and seal, as a judicial officer, that all was done in conformity to law.</p>

But, say the court in the last case, “ that we would deprive married women of all substantial protection, did we give to the separate examination of a judge or justice of the peace the conclusive effect of an examination by commissioners to levy a fine, which is more private, careful, and searching.” “ The necessities of justice therefore demand that the transaction be open to objection, not only for fraud, but concealed duress.”</p>

Louden, the plaintiff, she was asked to execute this mortgage, which she refused to do, and retired to her chamber, where she lay in bed weeping. She was followed there and importuned by her husband to sign the mortgage, which she still refused to do, stating to him that he was aware of her unwillingness to divest herself of this property, which she desired to retain as a home for herself and him, if he survived her. He continued to press her, and she refused. Having persevered for a long time without success, her husband turned away, apparently agitated, declaring that he would not remain on the property if she refused to execute the mortgage; and he went out of the chamber. She was then pressed by the relative of her husband, with repeated solicitation, — when she got from her bed and wrote her name to the mortgage, and immediately gave the pen a dash, as if to strike out her name. The justice, who was in the other room with S. Louden throughout the afternoon, is brought into the chamber of the weeping wife at candle-light, and asks Mrs. Blythe if she signed the mortgage with her own consent, to which she answered, <em>“ </em>It is of no use to deceive you: I had no will in the business; my will was not consulted.” The justice again asked her whether he understood her to say that she did not sign the mortgage with her own free will and consent, to which she replied, “I did say so.” He repeated the question several times, and to which Mrs. Blythe gave the same answer. Her health was delicate, and she was in tears most of the afternoon. She declared that she was willing that all her personal property should go to pay the debts of the firm of <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>which her husband was a partner, but that she was unwilling to sign a mortgage of the house and lot, as she felt certain that her husband would be disappointed in lifting it.

It appears that the justice, on subsequent reflection, felt not a little compunction of conscience, in allowing himself to have been instrumental, as the organ of the law, to take and certify to such an acknowledgment by this distressed, opposing, and defenceless wife. Eor we have him declaring “ that he never would take another acknowledgment under similar circumstances.” Well might he regret that on that occasion, as a public magistrate, he did not take an independent stand on the side of the law and of the oppressed wife.</p>
