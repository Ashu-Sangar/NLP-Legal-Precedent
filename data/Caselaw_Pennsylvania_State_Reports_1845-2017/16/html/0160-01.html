The plaintiffs declared on an executed contract, alleging performance by delivery of the hogs, and claimed damages of the defendant for a refusal to pay. The evidence furnished by the plaintiffs proved that they had, at Baltimore, the hogs contracted for at the time appointed; and that they were then and there ready to deliver the same to Kelly, the defendant, • who refused to accept the hogs, or pay for them, but there was no delivery. As the plaintiffs failed to prove a performed contract on their part as laid in the narr., the court below was right in saying that the plaintiffs could not recover.</p>

The construction of the contract, <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>the injury to the plaintiffs, and the measure of damages were the same under one allegation as under the other.</p>

In accordance are the cases of Newlin <em>v. </em>Palmer, 11 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>98; Cunningham <em>v. </em>Day, 2 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>1; Schoneman <em>v. </em>Fegley, 7 <em>Barr </em>434; Caldwell <em>v. </em>Remington, <a href="/whart/2/0132-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Whart. 132" data-case-ids="1830527" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0132-01">2 <em>Whar. </em>132</a>; Rodrigue <em>v. </em>Curcier, 15 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>83.</p>

But this court, on error, “held that it was improperly admitted, because it introduced a new cause of action.” In this case, the contract declared on, the cause of action alleged, and the redress sought were the same under the amendment proposed as under the narr. last filed.
