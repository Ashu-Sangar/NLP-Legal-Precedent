In his declaration, he sets out that on the 20th of March 1850, the defendant received $158.43 for the forbearance of $665 for the time Mr. Longnecker had the use of the money — which, by a calculation, you will find to be the interest upon the entire principal of $7 00, and the bonus of $35 .added, <em>and we instruct you that the device made use of, paying over the </em>$35 and immediately paying it back, is a mere fraud upon the statute, and affords the person practising it no shield from the effect of its penalty.

Lindsey, 4 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>449, decides the point. It was there held by the court that “ under the act of 2d of March 1723, the offence of taking usurious interest is committed by every successive receipt of such interest, and under the 6th section of the act of 26th of March 1785, a suit to recover the penalty may be brought within a year after the last successive receipt of such interest.”</p>

A distinction between interest and a bonus may seem to be a flimsy one; but it is not. A return of part of the sum on which interest is reserved, reduces the contract essentially to a loan of the residue. The formal delivery of the whole with one hand, and the retrenchment of a part of it with the other, like the formal delivery of a chattel returned at the execution of a bill of sale of it, is, in either case, simply a transparent artifice to elude the statute. The money returned, unlike the silk gown sometimes exacted by a wife for joining in a conveyance, is not a premium, but a discount; and the detention of part of a bank loan, as payment of interest in advance, is legalized only by inveterate custom. If there was such a detention in this case, the contract for the nominal sum was usurious, but the offence was not committed till something had been received on it. In this view of the subject, it would seem to be indifferent whether the sum detained were greater than the amount of the interest or not: payment of interest on the usurious loan would still be necessary. But the point is immaterial, as the whole interest was taken within the period of limitation; for it was ruled in Lamb <em>v. </em>Lindsey, and Scurry <em>v. </em>Freeman, the latter of which is precisely like the case we have to deal with, that every fresh taking is a fresh consummation of the same offence.</p>
