    "head_matter": "Vandruff et al. versus Rinehart.\nIf one having testamentary capacity is unable from palsy or other cause to make his signature or mark to his will, another person may steady his hand and aid him in so doing; and it is not necessary to prove an express request from the testator for such assistance.\nSuch act is the testator's own, performed with the assistance of another, and not the act of another done under authority from the testator.\nError to the Court of Common Pleas of Greene county.\nThis was a feigned issue to try the validity of the will of John Rinehart, deceased, dated September 1st, 1854, in which issue the plaintiffs in error were defendants below.\nThe will was written by Mr. Lucas by the testator\u2019s direction. He examined it carefully, and it being satisfactory Mr. Lucas wrote his (testator\u2019s) name to it, and testator attempted to make his mark to it, but being badly affected with the palsy was unable to do so without assistance, and Mr. Lucas steadied his hand while he made his mark. Mr. Lucas in his testimony says \u201c the testator could not have held the pen to write his name.\u201d It did not appear affirmatively that testator expressly requested Mr. Lucas to steady his hand, but after it was executed he requested Mr. Lucas \u201c to take it and keep it locked up,\u201d which he did. The will was witnessed by Lewis Jennings and John D. Whitaker. Defendants below, on the trial, presented the following points :\u2014\n\u201c 1. That it is essential to the validity of this will that it be signed by the testator, or by some person in his presence, and by his express direction, unless prevented by the extremity of his last sickness; and if it be otherwise signed, no subsequent ratification by the testator will give it validity.\n\u201c 2. That the signing of the will by the testator, by mark or otherwise, or by some one in his presence, by his express direction, must in either case be proved by two witnesses ; and these facts cannot be presumed from the silence or the conduct of the testator, after the alleged will was signed; and in the absence of such proof, the plaintiffs cannot recover.\n\u201c 3. That if the hand of the testator in making his mark was guided and directed by another person, it must appear affirmatively, by the testimony of two witnesses at least, that it was done by his express direction; otherwise plaintiffs cannot recover.\n\u201c 4. That neither of the witnesses having testified that the testator affixed his mark to the will himself, or expressly directed some one to do it in his presence, its execution is not therefore sufficiently proved.\u201d\nWhich the court (Gilmore, P.) answered as follows:\u2014\n\u201c To the first, second, third, and fourth points put by defendant\u2019s counsel, the court answered, that if the evidence of Whitaker, Jennings, and Lucas is believed, the execution of the will is sufficiently proved.\u201d\nNovember 19th, 1857,\nAnd this answer is the error complained of.\njBlack $ Phelan and Sayers JDonney, for plaintiffs in error.\u2014\nThe Act of 8th April, 1833, says: \u201c Every will shall be in writing, and, unless the person making the same shall be prevented by the extremity of his last sickness, shall be signed by him at the end thereof, or by some person in his presence, or by his express direction; and in all cases shall be proved by the oaths or affirmations of two or more competent witnesses, otherwise such will shall be of no effect.\u201d There can, we think, be no mistaking the provisions of this law. Drawn with singular clearness and precision, it would certainly seem to cover every conceivable case. If prevented by the extremity of last sickness from signing or requesting some one else to do so, the will is valid, all other things being regular. But where there is ability, the testator must sign himself, or expressly request some one else to do so. In either event the act must be his own. If another signs for him it must be at his own order. The law neither contemplates nor allows a joint execution, or a signing by proxy without express authority. It must be the testator\u2019s own voluntary, unaided act \u2014 otherwise the signing cannot be by him. Aside from the fraud which would inevitably result from such a departure from the plain requirement of the Act of Assembly, as is now proposed, where would be the certainty of the rule ?\nThere being no pretence that the testator expressly requested Mr. Lucas to assist him in making his mark, this will can only be sustained then on the ground that he made the cross or mark himself \u2014 a position utterly preposterous, for the testator was virtually as incapable of such an act as a dead man, as is fully shown by all the testimony. The Act of Assembly therefore providing expressly for such a case, there can be no room for an execution by implication or presumption. But we think there is abundant authority for a rigid adherence to the letter as well as the spirit of the Act of Assembly: Stevens and Wife v. Vancleve, 4 W. C. C. R. 263; Dunlap v. Dunlap, 10 Watts 153; Cavett\u2019s Appeal, 8 W. & S. 21; Asay v. Hoover, 5 Barr 32; Grabill v. Barr, Id. 441; Greenough v. Greenough, 1 J. 489.\nWith these views, it is respectfully submitted that the court erred in its answer to the defendant\u2019s points; for, to give the testimony of Jennings, of Whitaker, and of Lucas entire credit, it does not prove such an execution of the alleged will as the law requires ; and so the jury should have been charged.\nLindsey and Buchanan, for defendant in error."
