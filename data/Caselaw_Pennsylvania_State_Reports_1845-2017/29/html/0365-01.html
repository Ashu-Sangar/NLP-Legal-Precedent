Gray made an affidavit of defence, setting forth “that sometime in the year 1853 Jones &amp; Co., of Pittsburgh, applied to him to become an accommodation endorser and acceptor of negotiable paper, for the benefit of said firm, to be discounted for them at the Merchants’ and Mechanics’ Bank of Pittsburgh, to an amount not exceeding $25,000; at their request he did, at sundry times, between that time and the 1st of July, 1855, endorse and accept their negotiable hills and notes for their accommodation, to an amount unknown to him, but which he was informed and believed did not exceed that sum; and that the new notes and bills, from time to time presented for his endorsement or acceptance, were for the purpose and would be applied to the meeting and taking up prior acceptances and endorsements. That the said Jones &amp; Co., fraudulently and in collusion with some person or persons unknown to defendant, did not apply the same to the said purpose. That this defendant had no interest in the said partnership of Jones &amp; Co., nor in the proceeds of said negotiable paper, but only endorsed and accepted <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>the same for their accommodation.

We do not think so. That was a case of cheating with false pretences, which is a fraud that the law denounces as a crime, and <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>for which the guilty party may be punished with the penitentiary, and the paper in suit there was obtained in the perpetration of that crime. It was as if it had been stolen. But here the acceptances sued on were voluntarily made in pursuance of a precedent contract, and for the purpose of giving negotiability to the bills. The acceptor expected them to pass by the endorsement of Jones &amp; Co., and held himself out to the world as responsible for them into whosesoever hands they might come. The affidavit does indeed allege that, according to the contract between the parties, the proceeds of the acceptances were to be applied to the taking up of prior notes and acceptances of Gray, and that Jones &amp; Co. were guilty of a breach of that contract, for they did not so apply the proceeds. The fraud consisted in misapplying the proceeds of the paper, but that in the very nature of the case imparted no taint to the paper itself. The purpose for which the bills were made and put into circulation, was to furnish Jones &amp; Co. with funds to be applied according to their contract with Gray. That was an honest and fair purpose. How could the purchaser of the bills be expected to have any knowledge of the private agreement between the original parties ? And if he had, how could it be expected that he would see to the application of the funds he paid for the bills ?</p>

To permit an acceptor to set up such a breach of confidence against an endorsee of negotiable paper — a breach or fraud if you please so to call it, occurring after the rights of the endorsee have fully vested — would be against the plainest principles of equity as well as subversive of the commercial law.</p>
