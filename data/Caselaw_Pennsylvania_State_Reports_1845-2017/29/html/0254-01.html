Haverstick, on the 25th day of July, 1853, purchased a lot in the city of Erie, from “ The Erie Gras Company,” for $1500, and paid the whole of the money on the day of the purchase. The defendants entered into contract under seal, by which they covenanted and agreed to make, execute, and deliver to the plaintiff a good and sufficient deed of conveyance of the said lot, in fee simple, clear of all encumbrances, on or before the 1st day of November, 1853. There was nothing mentioned in the contract as to when possession was to be given. It was unimproved. Plaintiff took no actual possession of the lot, but paid the taxes on it for the year 1854, and promised to the collector to pay them for 1855, but afterwards refused. The lot was assessed in plaintiff’s name, but it did not appear by whose order or direction. There was no evidence that plaintiff had ever asked for or demanded a deed. On the 22d day of January, 1856, plaintiff brought this action of covenant to rescind the contract (as he alleged on the argument), but nothing to show such intention appeared in the declaration or on the record. The declaration set out the contract, assigned the breach, and alleged damages in the common form. On the 2d day of February, 1856, the defendants tendered to plaintiff a deed for the lot, and a release from a pre-existing mortgage, and the amount of costs already incurred in this suit, which he declined to receive.</p>

There is no proof of the kind here, and consequently the plaintiff cannot recover beyond what the law will presume. But he has been driven to bring his suit, and in doing so, to employ counsel, for which a reasonable compensation should also be made. This latter, however, is very questionable, but we charge it as law for the present.”</p>
