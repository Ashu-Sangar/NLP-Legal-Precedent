The Erie and Waterford Turnpike and Parade street, are two parallel roads, running south from the city of Erie, 2l7 rods apart. The road on which the injury happened was, and had been a regularly laid out road since 1824. In 1846 the road commissioners of Millcreek township, upon a petition of citizens, • laid out and opened a new road between the aforesaid two roads, locating it about 60 rods north of the before-mentioned cross road, and vacated the said road. In 1858 the Erie and Waterford Plank-road was built, south from the city of Erie, between the turnpike and Parade street, about thirty rods from the turnpike, and for the convenience of the public, that portion of the vacated road between the turnpike and plank-road was left open and travelled. In September, 1853, Mr. Reed with his wife in a carriage attempted to drive along this road, which at that time was obstructed by timber. The wheel of the carriage struck the timber — overturned the carriage — Mrs. Reed was thrown out and her leg broken; for the recovery of damages for which injury this suit was brought. The road commissioners worked on that road in the early part of the summer of 1853.</p>

The township authorities did work on it in 1853, and treated it as a public road, and are bound by their act.</p>

The township offered the proceedings of the road commissioners of Millcreek township, showing that a new road had been substituted for the one where the injury occurred, and that the latter had been vacated before the time of the injury. The court rejected the evidence on the ground that the commissioners had no authority to vacate the road. The 20th section of the Act of 13th April, 1843, authorizes the commissioners <em>“ </em>to take the general charge and supervision of all the roads and bridges in each of the townships in the said county (of Erie), county bridges excepted, and to lay out <em>and alter the. same </em>at the request in writing of the citizens,” &amp;c. The authority to alter a road is an authority to substitute a new road for an old one, and whenever this is done, the old road, so far as it is supplied by the new one, is vacated. The road commissioners had therefore authority to vacate any road within their jurisdiction, as soon as they supplied its place by a new one answering the same purposes. The proceedings of the road commissioners, for aught that appears, were in accordance with their powers, and ought to have been received in evidence. The proceedings instituted by Cassimer Siegel against the road commissioners, under the eighth and ninth sections of the Act of 26th March, 1846, were a part of the proceedings relating to the confirmation of the act of the commissioners in altering the road in question. All these proceedings related to a public right. Any citizen might have taken part in them, and all are bound by them. The laying out of a public road is in the nature of a proceeding <em>in </em>rem, and binds all the world. The confirmation at the suit of Cassimer Siegel is. made by the statute “ final and conclusive in regard to the road for two years.” This does not mean that the whole proceedings are null and void at the expiration of two years. It means no more than to suspend for two years all efforts to change the road thus altered or laid out. At the end of two years new petitions for altering the road may be presented. But until the action of the commissioners be regularly reversed, according to law, their proceedings are conclusive on all matters within their powers.</p>
