Of this amount, 7101 shares had been subscribed for, leaving 899 shares in the hands of the bank. On the 2d February 1850, the bank resolved to increase the stock by allowing those of the stockholders “ who had paid up their instalments in full,” to subscribe for one additional share for every six shares of the stock they then held; and for that purpose books were to be opened, at the banking-house, between the 13th and 31st May 1850.</p>

It was essentially different from the present case. Reese had, while the books were open, paid the stock he held to its par value, and demanded of the bank his right to subscribe to the new stock. The books were open from the 13th of May 1850, to the 31st of the same month. On the 24th of May 1850, Reese demanded the new stock to which he conceived he was entitled, and offered to pay, and tendered the money for the same, and having been refused, brought suit and recovered his damages.</p>

By the adoption of the latter course, each stockholder acquired a distinct and several right which any one could define by a mere arithmetical calculation. It was a right that could not be given to one without being given to all, and the <em>denial to the plaintiff of Ms share </em>was a legal injury, a violation of his personal right, for which he is entitled to compensation.”</p>
    <p id="b538-9" data-blocks='[["BL_538.13",538,[289,1988,1162,343]]]'>The plaintiff’s recovery was based upon the <em>denial </em>to him of his <em>right </em>to the stock. Now there could be no <em>denial </em>until a <em>demand has leen made. </em>Reese did demand the stock. He did all that he could do in order to secure the stock; and it having been refused, his right to damages was complete, and he became entitled to compensation. The denial of this right was a <em>tort, </em>the court say, which could be waived, and damages recovered in <em>assumpsit.</em>

The duty of the bank to perfect this right, by allowing him to subscribe, assumed the dignity of a trust. This was the ruling in 26 <em>Penna. State Reports </em>143, and we perform a plain judicial duty in standing fast by that decision. Between the two cases there is a just distinction. That plaintiff went forward and said, here is my money, give me the stock. This one did nothing, except to make a tardy payment of instalments due on the old stock, and then to relapse into a tranquillity unbroken for nearly six years. He may have doubted whether this increase of stock would enhance its value, or he may have secured for his money a better investment. Of his possession of the money at the time, the record contains no evidence, and the presumption that a man, who is called to pay and does not, was able to pay, is not sufficiently justified by human experience to warrant its legal sanction. He certainly neither offered to pay nor to subscribe, and the law is too reasonable to force any man’s rights upon him against his will. The fact that he fails to act while others are acting in a matter which concerns both, is sufficient proof of his acquiescence to prevent the destruction of what has been done by others through faith in that state of things. Had he notice of the resolution ? The suit itself, based on the bank’s action, shows that at some time he received notice. The declaration sets forth this time. It avers that, on the 2d of February, he was then and there ready to subscribe. This was his allegation, binding to the uttermost, though he failed to prove it, and it would be difficult to say how he could have stood ready to do that of which he had no knowledge. The language employed is said to be common and formal. Justly so, but not less operative on that account than if it embodied the profoundest original conception, for legal phraseology loses no force by age or use. We are, on these grounds, of opinion that the court below ruled the cause wisely.</p>
