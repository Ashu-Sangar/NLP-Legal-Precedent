Donnel, if living, in a controversy between the present plaintiff and himself could not avail himself of the Staples title. Von Neida’s original interest in this land stands upon very different grounds from those on which the interest of the Geiger heirs stands. After the first <em>scire facias </em>upon the Sholl mortgage was issued, and while Mr. Donnel was acting for the heirs, he procured the deed from Staples. The plaintiff insists that the evidence shows Donnel to have been acting as trustee for the heirs. The court entertain the same opinion. Donnel could not make his title available against the heirs. It is not pretended that he ever desired to do so; but he was not Von Neida’s trustee. The estate of Von Neida was divested in 1826, after the lapse of two years, allowed for redemption. Mr. Donnel, according to the plaintiff's theory, became the trustee of the parties, for whom he purchased. There is no proof of an intention to reinstate Von Neida in his original rights. There is no presumption of any abandonment of the <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>Staples title. Its acquisition was cotemporaneous with the proceedings on the <em>scire facias. </em>As against all the world, except the party to whom he owed some legal duty or obligation, Mr. Donnel’s title, while he was permitted to retain its possession, had the same effect it would have had if no such duty or obligation had been created.</p>

The purchase at the tax sale in 1840, is to be taken, under the evidence, to have been made for the benefit of Elisha Geiger’s heirs. It was procured by Mr. Donnel. Christopher Geiger was acting for the heirs in 1829, and employed counsel for them, as the record of the <em>scire facias </em>and his own testimony, offered by the plaintiff, show. The purchase in 1840 cannot be held to have been made for the benefit of Yon Neida.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b142-7" data-blocks='[["BL_142.7",142,[281,972,1155,773]]]'>“ 5th. Elisha Geiger, at the time of his death, held the legal title to one-half of the land in dispute, under the constructive obligation to convey it to Yon Neida when he should be required to do so. This was a naked trust which would descend by the English system to the heir at common law. It is not necessary under the view which the court have of this case, to inquire whether the rule governing formal and direct trusts, and which is supposed to be still in force in Pennsylvania, applies to a case like this, since the passage of the Act of 31st March, 1792 (3 <em>Smith's Laws </em>66), ‘ to enable executors and administrators to convey lands contracted for with their decedents,’ and the supplements to that act. Even if the rule were admitted to be in force, it would still have been competent for Christopher Geiger to acquire this land in 1840 by a tax sale to the exclusion of Yon Neida. By the conveyance to Staples, the original title was divested. And at the second tax sale, though Christopher were to be regarded as holding the legal title as the heir at common law, he could still buy.</p>

Christopher Geiger testifies that it was procured without his knowledge. The proceeding was the act of Mr. Donnel. The securing of convenience in conveyancing and the closing of all questions relating to the payment of antecedent taxes, would be obvious motives for it. Christopher was acting for the heirs, and Mr. Donnel was the counsel employed by him. In the language of the point, however, ‘ if valid’ — that is, if the land was purchased for the sole and exclusive benefit of Christopher, and irrespective of all previously subsisting obligations on his part — ‘it discharged the Staples title,’ and took the place of every former estate and interest in the land.</p>

The regularity of the title from the Commonwealth to Von Neida seems not to have been contested. But the defendants allege that, that title has been divested by a treasurer’s sale for taxes. And in support of this, offer the sheriff’s deed-book, showing the acknowledgment by George Weiser, treasurer of Northumberland county, on the 20th of August, 1824, of a deed to Edward Staples for the land in question, sold on the 16th. of June of the same year. The deed having been lost, this, in connexion with the testimony of Hon. Charles Hegins, was offered as additional evidence of the existence of the deed. It was admitted, and forms the first bill of exceptions. Almost every official paper or entry found in the commissioner’s or prothonotary’s office in relation to unseated lands, has been held as proper to go to a jury. Independent of the testimony of Judge Hegins, it would have been rightly received for what it was worth. And with his evidence, and for the purposes intended, it was correctly admitted.</p>

Reinboth his executor, with power to sell his real estate. Thus stood the plaintiff’s title until the 16th of June, 1824, when the land was sold at treasurer’s sale for the non-payment of taxes, to Edward Staples, and two years were suffered to pass without any redemption. What now was the position of the parties ? The instrument of the 1st of April, 1817, clearly shows that, although the deed was in the name of Elisha Geiger, the undivided half of the tract belonged to Yon Neida. They were, therefore, at the time of sale, tenants in common, and had either redeemed, or, within two years, purchased the treasurer’s title, it would have enured to the benefit of both; but the time of redemption having passed, the title of the former owner was gone, and the purchaser (Staples) coming in as a stranger, there being no privity between him and the former owners, his title was absolute. And now, either the heirs of Geiger or Yon Neida, might have purchased of Staples the entire title with perfect safety. But they have not, nor has the plaintiff, shown any other title that is available against the defendants. On the 31st of October, 1829, Edward Staples conveyed this land to Charles G. Donnel; and plaintiffs contend that, as Mr. Donnel appeared as attorney for the heirs of Elisha Geiger to an <em>alias scire facias, </em>on mortgage, issued to November Term, 1830, against David Sholl, who then owned this land; and, as Christopher Geiger proves that he employed Mr. Donnel as counsel for his father’s estate, the purchase of Staples would enure to the benefit of Elisha Geiger’s heirs, and Donnel would be estopped from asserting title in himself. If this were admitted, it could not benefit the plaintiff, who must show a good title in <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>himself, and <em>his </em>title was divested, beyond redemption, in 1826. The legal title, derived from Staples, was in Dorinel; and, even if he held it in trust for Elisha Geiger’s heirs, the plaintiff could gain nothing by setting up the title of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>as all privity between himself and the Geigers was severed by the treasurer’s sale, after which, there being no redemption, the treasurer’s deed, in whosesoever hand it might be, could be well set up against the plaintiff as an outstanding title.</p>
    <p id="b145-6" data-blocks='[["BL_145.6",145,[203,768,1162,1333]]]'>Again, it is said that Elisha Geiger held the undivided half of the land in question as trustee for Von Neida; and that, upon the death of Geiger, the trust estate descended to Christopher (his oldest son and heir-at-law), who could not purchase at treasurer’s sale so as to defeat the title of his <em>.cestui que trust </em>Von Neida; and that the tax sale of 1840, if valid, discharged the staple title. If the land was unseated, and a tax duly assessed and unpaid, and of this no question was made on the trial, the tax sale of 1840 would certainly prevail over the Staple title of 1824, and it would as certainly prevail over the plaintiff’s title which was lost by the sale in 1824. There is no ground for saying that Christopher Geiger, by his purchase, through Charles Donnel, in 1840, held any interest in the land in trust for Von Neida; and how far he held in trust for the other heirs of his father, is a question with which the plaintiff has no concern. Had he purchased at the sales of 1840, his right to do so could not be disputed by the heirs of Geiger. They owed no duty to each other after their title became extinct' by the treasurer’s sale of 1824. The tax sale of 1840 may have been unnecessary — it may have been on the part of Mr. Donnel, as the court below observed, “ a measure of professional precaution,” or the “ securing of convenience in conveyancing.” It is unlike a sale by the sheriff, which conveys only the title of the defendant. A tax sale extinguishes all previous titles; and, if Christian Geiger (whose interest in the land was afterwards conveyed to the Zerbe Hun and Shamokin Improvement Company) had the slightest doubt of the sufficiency of the former title, he had a right to perfect it by a purchase at the sales of 1840, and by this, as well as the former sale, the plaintiff’s title was gone. There was, therefore, no error in the court saying that, “ upon the whole case, if the jury believe the testimony of Judge Hegins, the defendants are entitled to a verdict.”</p>
