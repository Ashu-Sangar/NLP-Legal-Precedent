The solution of this question depends on the true character of .the transactions between Wilson and Alexander, leading to and terminating in the deeds of 15th January, 1850. Regarding the form of the deed alone from Wilson and wife as 'a naked purchase and sale of land, there could be no doubt of her right as tenant in fee, to hold and dispose of the premises, under well considered and repeated decisions of the Supreme Court. But if these two deeds, when taken together, and in connexion with the will of John Taylor, and the facts that they first occupied the land together, and subsequently ran a line dividing the land, and each entered into the separate possession of his own part, show only a partition, and not an ordinary purchase and sale, then the mere form of the deed is to be disregarded, and the true intent and meaning of the parties are to be carried into effect by regarding the deeds merely in the light of mutual releases. And in that case the deed would confer on the wife no title by survivorship, and the plaintiff would have a right to recover at least two undivided third parts of the land in dispute.</p>

Such a stand-point will afford us a much clearer view than any other. Here, then, we have the two brothers holding in common, as their deeds declare, a large tract of land devised to them by their father, under specific directions how it shall be divided and held in severalty. We find them making a division of the same according to these directions, and each taking exclusive possession of his own portion — then follows the execution and delivery of mutual deeds alike in' everything but the transposing of the names and the description of the property. The consideration in each is one dollar. These facts taken together clearly characterize the transaction as one of partition merely, and not an ordinary purchase and sale, so as to bring it under the rule of law, applicable to the case of survivorship by the wife.</p>

Granting for the present that her right of dower existed in full force at the date of her deed to Birmingham, and that it might still be enforced in her name for his use, by instituting the appropriate proceedings, we come directly to the question whether that right can avail the defendant in the present action.
