The farms of the Whetstones are situated on Cove Creek, and about two miles from the plaintiff’s mill. On these farms is a “ sink,” into which, in ordinary stages, the greater part of the water of Cove Creek enters, and flows in a subterranean channel, or stream, to within a short distance above Bowser’s mill, where it appears again on the surface, and forms the power for propelling the machinery of the mill. In an ordinary <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>stage, the greater part of the water, in its natural flow, enters into the sink, and the balance flows down a channel which passes near to the houses and improvements of the Whetstones. To keep up this flow during a low stage of water, it was necessary to place a small dam of stone and gravel in the stream, near the sink, which had been maintained by the Whetstones, and those under whom they claimed, for a period of forty or fifty years.</p>

The Whetstones rebuilt,-and he tore it away again. It was again rebuilt by the Whetstones, and about four feet higher up the stream, and which it was alleged turned more water away from the sink than the old dam. Thereupon Bowser brought an action on the case against Samuel and David Whetstone, on the 2d October,- 1854, for diverting the water. The Whetstones also brought an action on the case against Bowser, for diverting the water, and at the same time an action of trespass for entering upon their land, and tearing away their dam. On the 25th April, 1855, these several suits were settled and compromised by the parties, “ their rights to the water to remain as heretofore.”</p>

Bowser is the owner of a mill on Cove Creek. The stream, before it reaches the mill, passes through lands of defendants some two miles above, and on what is called the David Whetstone Farm, the waters of the stream fall into a ‘sink,’ and reach the mill of plaintiff by a subterranean passage. There is a dry channel through which the creek may have <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>run in former days, or it may be that the channel was washed out by the water which the sink did not carry away. It seems, from the earliest times, there was a dam above the sink, which directed a certain portion of the waters into a ditch, by means of which the water was conveyed around the large and small sinks into the dry channel down which it passed, and was used by the families residing there for domestic and agricultural purposes.</p>

The plaintiff is entitled to the use of all the water that would naturally flow in his direction, except so much as the defendants may have acquired a right to by use. The counsel for the plaintiff in the argument admit that the defendants have acquired a prescriptive right to divert a certain portion of the water from the stream by means of the dam, which was in existence prior to 1854, and the counsel (Mr. King) of defendants, says that they claim no more.</p>

The questions in this case must be settled on their own merits. If Bowser has wronged the defendants, they have their right to an action against him, and the counsel admit that they have already commenced an action of trespass against Bowser, or at least that Samuel Whetstone has. If the jury, from the evidence, believe that the natural flow of the water of the stream is into the sink, and from thence by a subterranean passage to the mill of plaintiff, then the plaintiff is entitled to all the water that would reach his mill, except so much as the defendants had acquired a prescriptive right to. And plaintiff complains that some time in 1854, defendants not only built a dam across the stream, higher up than the old one, by means of which they greatly reduced the flow into the dry channel; but that they also threw stones, gravel, and other matter into the sink, and thus obstructed the free flow of the water to the mill.

And if they made an honest effort to that effect, and have succeeded, except in some immaterial particulars, they have done all that can be required at their hands, and it is of no importance whether the dam is a few feet higher or lower in the stream; so that it does not divert a greater portion of water than formerly; but if the quantity is reduced to any considerable degree, the plaintiff is injured, and must have your verdict.</p>

It is also in evidence that one of the defendants was seen throwing gravel and other matter into the sink. It is an important fact that the dam is higher up in the stream.

The stream in question here was one of that character; and the plaintiff had a right to bring an action for diverting it, without setring out the privilege or license under which the defendants claimed a right to divert a portion of the water. In trespass this defence must be 'pleaded. In an action on the case, it may be given in evidence under the general issue.

In this case, if the <em>new </em>dam diverted more water than the defendants are entitled to take from the watercourse, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. Whether the defendants lost their rights entirely by claiming more than they were entitled to, is not material to the present investigation; and the opinion of the court on that question is not therefore the subject of review in the present action. We see nothing in this judgment, however, to prevent the defendants from erecting a new dam in conformity to their ancient rights.

The plaintiff below might perhaps have assigned for error that the obstructions wrere caused under circumstances of aggravation which entitled him to claim exemplary damages.
