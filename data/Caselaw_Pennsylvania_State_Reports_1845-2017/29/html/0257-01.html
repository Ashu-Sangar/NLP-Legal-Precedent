Weamer &amp; Son, against Thomas Juart, to recover a book account for goods sold and delivered. The plaintiffs were merchants in the town of Plumville, from 1848 till 1851, when Joseph Weamer, one of the partners, died. During the existence of the partnership the defendant dealt in the store, and this suit was brought to recover an alleged balance due the firm.</p>

He is the surviving partner of Joseph Weamer, deceased, his son, and the entries in the books were principally made by the son while he was living. They have been read in evidence, and amount in the aggregate to the sum of f&gt;21.45-J. If the case rested here, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover. The books, after the necessary preliminary proof, are <em>prima facie </em>evidence of the accuracy of the charges, and of the amount charged. But they are only <em>prima facie </em>evidence, and maybe rebutted by countervailing proof of their incorrectness.</p>

Books are not merely evidence of a single transaction, but they are the record of the daily transactions of a merchant with his customers generally, and it is from this fact they are admitted at all. Books thus kept are considered the medium of legal proof, and as such evidence of truth. So long as they are honestly and fairly kept, they may be safely relied on. But like the testimony of living witnesses, they may by degrees, and from the discovery by many customers, of various and general inaccuracies, acquire such a reputation for incorrectness as to render them quite unworthy of credit. If their reputation be so bad that they cannot be trusted as evidence of truth, they ought to be disregarded and rejected by the jury. The question is one for the jury, and as such is left to them. If otherwise, the jury will take the account as proved, unless they believe it was settled.”</p>

They are evidence manufactured by the shopkeeper himself, for his own purposes, and without any chance of supervision by his customer. In their best estate, therefore, it is proper to subject them, when offered in evidence, to severe scrutiny. But when they have acquired a general reputation for inaccuracy — when the shopkeeper has through fraud or carelessness made false entries, or omitted true ones, so frequently as to destroy the confidence of his customers in both himself and his books, what reason is there for insisting that a jury shall trust them ? How can private entries which a whole community have learned to discredit promote the ends of justice ? They are no more worthy of the confidence of a court and jury than a witness whose reputation for truth and veracity is impeached.</p>
    <p id="b259-10" data-blocks='[["BL_259.14",259,[212,1634,1162,202]]]'>We approve entirely of the reasons assigned by the court for their ruling. That part of the charge which is quoted in the 4th assignment of error answers satisfactorily the first assignment, and is in accordance with the cases cited by the counsel of the defendant in error.</p>

A large number of witnesses discredited his general character for honesty and .for correct bookkeeping, and this was pertinent, but none of them spoke of his character for truth and veracity. As he was in his grave and not a witness, this, the usual test of the credibility of testimony, was inapplicable; but though ruled to be competent, it was not in fact applied, and so no harm was done.</p>

The court submitted all the evidence, the books, the testimony as to a settlement with Juart, and the discrediting testimony, to the jury. It would have been error to submit Wyncoop’s testimony “ independent of and apart from the books,” but this was not done. If the books contradicted <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>him, the jury had good reason for not believing the books. If the court did not say all on the subject that might have been properly said, the omission was not error, since the counsel did not direct their attention to that view of the testimony which they now complain of the court for not taking.</p>
