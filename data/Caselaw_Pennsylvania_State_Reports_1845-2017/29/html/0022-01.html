The plaintiff and defendant respectively owned tracts of land adjoining each other. The plaintiff purchased the land owned by him from the heirs of Andrew Morrow in 1828, and went into possession at that time by his tenant. The conveyance to him was not made until in 1830. The defendant became owner of the land held by him, in 1848. The plaintiff proved that he and those under whom he claims, owners and occupiers of the land now held by him, had used a road over and through a small portion of the land owned by defendant for a period of from thirty to forty years, and that the use of it had been continued by the plaintiff and his tenants in going to and from his land. The place <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>where the road was claimed and used was unenclosed woodland; and the defendant having cleared it enclosed it with a fence, and consequently closed up and prevented the use of the road.

That this right of way was acquired by using and enjoying the same for a period of more than twenty-one years, prior to the first day of June, 1853, the time when the same was obstructed by the defendant. The evidence shows that there was a road over the land of defendant which was used and enjoyed by the plaintiff, in going to and returning from his improved timber land mentioned in the declaration.</p>

After the lapse of that period, the law presumes a grant, and the burthen of the proof lies with the owner of the land through which the right is claimed, to repel the legal presumption. In 1850, the legislature passed an act which by its terms prevents such right of way over timber lands being acquired by user after the passage of the act; but this does not affect such rights perfected by the lapse of time, prior to its passage. In this case its effect will be to require of the plaintiff evidence satisfactory to you, that he and those under whom he claims, used and enjoyed this right of way which he now claims over the land of the defendant for twenty-one years, prior to the 25th day of April, 1850; any use which he may have made of this road after that date could not add to or give validity to his claim, if the period of twenty-one years had not expired in 1850, and if his right by lapse of time was perfected at that date, the Act of 1850 cannot impair his previously acquired right.</p>

The facts detailed in this point would be evidence to repel the presumption of a grant arising from lapse of time subsequent to 1849, and if Patterson had not perfected his right by user for twenty-one years prior to this date, the assertion of Okeson that Patterson should not have a road there, is legitimate evidence to repel the presumption of a grant arising from the lapse of time, subsequent to such assertion by Okeson.</p>

In establishing his right to the road, he relied upon an uninterrupted use and enjoyment of it for the period of twenty-one years. If he satisfied the jury of such adverse enjoyment, his right was complete, according to the principle which has been adopted as analogous to the statute of limitations, applicable to adverse possession of land. Resting, as the principle really does, upon the statute of limitations, it ought to be carried out according to the same rules. An uninterrupted adverse possession of land for the period of twenty-one years, gives a title which is not to be defeated by the mere protestations of the owner. He must make an entry or bring an action within twenty-one years, or his right is gone. So in the case of an easement over his lapd. The uninterrupted enjoyment of it for twenty-one years, adversely to the rights of the owner of the land, gives a title which cannot be defeated by mere objections or denials of the right. He must bring an action or obstruct the enjoyment within twenty-one years from its commencement, or his right to obstruct it is gone. It is often said that the period of twenty-one years’ enjoyment authorizes a jury to presume a grant and, following this fiction with logical precision, it is also frequently held that the presumption may be repelled by circumstances, showing that no such grant existed. But the premises being founded upon a fiction which has nothing substantial in it, and which is only tolerated for the purposes of remedy, the conclusion is necessarily unsound. There was nothing in the conversation which took place between the parties in 1849, that tended to show that the enjoyment of the right of way had been either interrupted before the right became perfect, or had been under a <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>license from the owner.
