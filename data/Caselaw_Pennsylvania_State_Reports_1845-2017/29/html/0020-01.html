An order to review was granted, and the reviewers reported against the vacation. The report was confirmed, and re-reviewers appointed, who reported in favour of the proposed vacation, and this report, on exceptions filed, was set aside, and <em>alias </em>re-reviewers appointed, four of whom, on the <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>20th of August, 1856, made report in favour of vacating the road, to which exceptions were filed, and on the 19th of January, 1857, overruled, and the report confirmed.</p>

On the 9th of August, four of the viewers who attended at the previous meeting, and one who had been prevented from attending by sickness, being now sworn, signed a paper in which they say, we “ do report we cannot agreethree being in <em>favour </em>of, and two <em>against, </em>vacating. ■ On the very same day, another of the viewers, who had been present on the 2d of August, was qualified, and had viewed the premises, signed a paper in which he said he was “in favour of vacating the road.” All this appears to have been done on the same day, and the. papers may have been signed near the same time. By the 8d section of the Act of 1836, viewers are required to “ make report at the next termand they had until that time to do so, as their-power was not yet exhausted. These papers do not appear to' have been filed, and are therefore not to be regarded as a report, but only as part of the deliberations of the viewers which resulted in the final report. There was no adjournment <em>sine die; </em>for in the last report the viewers say that, in consequence of their disagreement on the 9th inst., they again met on the 16th of August. They had a right to reconvene as often as became necessary.</p>

By the 52d section of the Act of 13th June, 1836, a view will be good and valid if five of the persons appointed shall view, and four of the actual viewers concur in the report. And it is immaterial whether the sixth person was absent, or being present refused to sign the report: 6 <em>Harris </em>220. In the present case, five of the viewers met on the 2d of August, re-reviewed the. premises, and not being able to agree, adjourned. And on the 9th of August they again met, and the sixth viewer being present, was qualified, and joined with the others in a further review without <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>being able to agree. On the 16th of August, 1856, four of the five viewers who had reviewed the ground together, after due deliberation, made their <em>final report, </em>vacating the parts of the roads therein referred to. This is all the law required. It was not material that Thomas Gr. Henderson, one of the dissenting viewers, should have been present at the first meeting. He afterwards attended, and took part in the proceedings. And it was equally immaterial that the report embraced parts of two roads, connected as they appeared to have been by the petition. When viewers and reviewers differ as to the necessity for a road, the court may adopt the report of either: <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%20109" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Whart. 109">3 <em>Wh. </em>109</a>; 3 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>236; <a href="/watts/1/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Watts 400" data-case-ids="1838030" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0400-01">1 <em>Watts </em>400</a>.</p>
