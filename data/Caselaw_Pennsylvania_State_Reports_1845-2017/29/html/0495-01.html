You, gentlemen, 'are to weigh the evidence. At this distance of time, I cannot, as requested by the plaintiff, tell you that, if all be believed, there is not sufficient proof of a parol contract. But, whether the evidence is credible, or, if so, whether it leaves any doubt as to the existence of the contract, the terms of it, or the payment of the purchase-money, are questions entirely for you.

If there was a written authority to convey, it would be otherwise. There is some evidence of it. Is it credible or satisfactory ? — this is for you. There were two witnesses spoke of it, William Taylor and Mix — the credibility of the latter has been attacked. A party must support his cause by credible witnesses. Do you believe the testimony of Mix ? Some witnesses said hi's character was not good; others said they had not heard anything against it. The probabilities of his evidence, from his position and calling, have been commented on. McNaughten said he had no boat there, and never built but one. Reed said he had built two or three. Then, was it probable that Workman would call on him to sign as a witness? When he refused, why did they not get some other to 'sign it ? Then, if there was no writing from William to Edmund, was there a sale by William <em>to </em>Guthrie, or a parol authority from William to Edmund to sell to Guthrie, and an actual sale made and possession taken by Guthrie in pursuance of the contract ? There appears to be no dispute as to the possession being taken by Guthrie, a.nd improvements made from 1843 to 1853. If there be the requisite proof of a contract of sale proven as to its extent and terms, or a parol authority by William to Edmund to make the sale; then, if the consideration was paid by Guthrie, and expenditures on the land as testified by Beman, we are of opinion that it would be unjust to rescind it. Because no action could be maintained by Guthrie, to recover compensation. He could not be compensated in damages. The statute of limitations would be interposed as a bar to his recovery. The work and labour he has expended— perhaps, for a time, fruitless — would not admit of compensation; the law would not estimate it.</p>

Lowry. These judgments were against both the brothers, and bound their entire interest in the land. Execution was out, and the sheriff under orders to sell. “William told me,” says the witness Andrews, “that Guthrie was going to have the mill; that they had sold for enough to make up these judgments, and a little more. He allowed it did not go for enough; but that it would not sell for as much at sheriff’s sale; they both allowed that.” According to Mix, whose credibility, though questioned, was for the jury, “William said he had made arrangements with Mr. Guthrie, and had sold the property. William said they had saved $400 or $500 by the operation by doing so; he did not say how much they had got.” How completely William concurred in putting Guthrie in possession, is shown by his advising him to retain Andrews at the mill, who “ <em>would do as well as anybody he could get.”</em>

Who would have equity must do equity. William cannot be permitted to enjoy the consideration received and to recover the land. It would be a fraud on Guthrie to let the plaintiff recover back premises so well paid for and so extensively improved. It is impossible for a case to be more destitute of merit than William’s. Indeed, it is not too much to say that he has no case. Having never acquired the legal title, he is found to have stripped himself of what equities he possessed, and now he is in court without law or equity to sustain him.</p>

The question in the cause, therefore, is not whether a chancellor would upon such proofs decree a conveyance to Guthrie, but whether such evidence would restrain him from decreeing a conveyance to William. There is a plain distinction taken in the books between the effect of parol evidence when set up to support and when to bar an equity. The leading case is Gorman <em>v. </em>Salisbury, 1 <em>Vernon </em>239, where the single point was whether an agreement in writing, made since the statute of frauds and perjuries, might be discharged by parol.

R. </em>39, that it, the statute, does not say a written agreement shall bind, but that an unwritten agreement shall not bind: <em>Sugden on Vendors </em>164, <em>et seq. </em>At page 176 this author enters into a critical analysis of several cases on the question of a parol discharge of written agreements, and concludes by saying (p. 180) that whether an absolute parol discharge of a written agreement, not followed by any other agreement upon which the parties have acted, can be set up even as a defence in equity, seems questionable. How he could express such a doubt after giving the result of the authorities he quotes in the distinct terms I have cited, I am at a loss to understand. Judge Kennedy alludes to this doubt of Sir E. Sugden in Boyce <em>v. </em>McCullach, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 429" data-case-ids="1854634" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0429-01">3 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>429</a>, where he held that a mere parol discharge of a written agreement for lands, without cancellation of the agreement, or removal from the lands, or any other decisive act in pursuance of the parol discharge, was binding as between the vendee and a subsequent purchaser from the vendor. Chancellor Kent, too, in Botsford <em>v. </em>Burr, 2 <em>Johns. Ch. R. </em>416, in ruling that parol evidence is admissible to rebut a resulting trust, added there may be a parol waiver even of a written agreement, and for this he refers himself to Price <em>v. </em>Dyer, 17 <em>Vesey </em>356, where the master of the rolls, Sir William Grant, though he did not rule the point, said, “ I incline to think upon the doctrine of this court such would be the effect of a parol waiver clearly and satisfactorily proved.”</p>
    <p id="b509-7" data-blocks='[["BL_509.7",509,[240,1787,1164,215]]]'>In Stevens <em>v. </em>Cooper, 1 <em>Johns. Ch. R. </em>429, Chancellor Kent distinctly recognised the rule, but said the evidence in such cases is good only as a defence to a bill for a specific performance, and is totally inadmissible at law or equity as a ground to compel a performance in specie.</p>

The point ruled in. Woollam <em>v. </em>Hearne, that though a defendant resisting specific performance may go into parol evidence to show that <em>by fraud </em>the written agreement does not express the <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>real terms, a plaintiff cannot do so for the purpose of obtaining a specific performance with a variation — is an emphatic expression of the distinction between a plaintiff <em>seeking </em>and a defendant <em>resisting </em>specific performance, but it is, in itself considered, a doctrine which we do not follow. In cases of fraud, mistake, surprise, or trust, we allow either plaintiff or defendant to go into parol evidence. We follow Chancellor Kent’s able opinion in Gillespie <em>v. </em>Moon, 2 <em>Johns. Ch. R. </em>585, as was indicated in our recent opinion in Raffensberger <em>v. </em>Collison &amp; Roth, Middle District, June Term, 1857. The American cases generally are to the same point, in questions of fraud or mistake, whilst on the precise point before us now, the right of a defendant to show by parol that the plaintiff has surrendered all his equities, I know of no discrepancy in the American authorities.

    <p id="b510-6" data-blocks='[["BL_510.6",510,[247,1058,1162,900]]]'>The truth that underlies this whole subject is, that specific performance rests in the discretion of the chancellor, and though, like his other powers, it is not to be arbitrarily exercised or withheld, but is governed by principles of reason and law, yet it is an extraordinary power, and whatever is calculated reasonably to persuade his conscience that in a given case it would be contrary to equity and justice to exercise it, must be admissible in evidence, or the rights of parties cannot be administered. The statute of frauds and perjuries has nothing to do with the question, and this ruling must not be confounded with those cases in which we have refused to <em>.transfer </em>titles on parol evidence. We do not violate the statute when we refuse to decree specific performance, but only when we decree it on less than written evidence. The statute does not say the written agreement shall bind, but that the unwritten agreement shall not bind. It is one thing for a chancellor to say, I will not decree a conveyance upon parol proof, in opposition to the letter and spirit of a statute, and a very different thing to say, I perceive you have no equity, though you hold written articles, because you have waived them for a valuable consideration in favour of him who holds the legal title. The difference is as palpable as a mountain, and I will say no more to illustrate it.</p>
    <p id="b510-7" data-blocks='[["BL_510.7",510,[247,1957,1161,473]],["BL_511.1",511,[236,410,1163,205]]]'>It is material to observe, however, that in the case before us there was much more in proof than a mere waiver by William of his rights under the articles of agreement. His receipt of the purchase-money, or what is the same thing, his acquiescence in the defendant’s payment to his use; his surrender of the possession to the defendant, and the encouraging him to occupy and improve; his total and long-continued abandonment of the premises, accompanied by declarations frequent, full, and precise, that he had sold the property to the very man from whom he now seeks to recover it; — these acts and declarations were sufficient to estop and bar the plaintiff, if anything short of a written instru<a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>ment could have that effect. And that a plaintiff may, by acts and declarations, without writing, place himself in circumstances to forfeit all right to the interposition of equity in his behalf, is abundantly evident from the authorities to which I have adverted.</p>
    <p id="b511-6" data-blocks='[["BL_511.6",511,[237,626,1163,505]]]'>This view of William’s case makes it unnecessary to consider several of the errors assigned to rulings that touched Edmund’s authority to execute the deed. That instrument, as well as the written order on Hannegan to convey the title to Guthrie, were properly received in evidence, for they were effectual, at the least, to vest Edmund’s interest in Guthrie, but we do not put our judgment on them as the deeds of William. If all the court said about parol authority to convey, and about subsequent ratification, were to be held erroneous, the judgment, so far as William is concerned, would have to be aflirmed, for there are facts and circumstances enough on the record to sustain it, independently of the written instrument.</p>
    <p id="b511-7" data-blocks='[["BL_511.7",511,[237,1141,1162,773]]]'>It is time, now, to look at the rights of the other plaintiff, James C. Workman. His interest originated in the same articles of agreement as that of his brothers; but his case, as presented upon the record before us, differs very widely from William’s. He never sold to Guthrie, nor encouraged him to buy of Edmund, nor to pay off liens, nor to take possession and make improvements. Guthrie does not claim <em>his </em>interest by virtue of any waiver, substitution, or surrender in his favour. He claims it no otherwise than under the deed of Edmund of 17th June, 1843, and the statute of limitations. The deed, as has just been said, was properly admitted in evidence for whatever interest Edmund had to convey; but inasmuch as under the original articles he was entitled to only an undivided third part, it wras necessary for the defendant to show a sale and transfer of James’s interest to Edmund. This branch of the ease involves no peculiar equities. It is the case of one man claiming another’s title in land, and so far as it involves a purchase, it is to be made out according to the law which regulates conveyances of real titles.</p>
    <p id="b511-8" data-blocks='[["BL_511.8",511,[239,1914,1161,516]],["BL_512.1",512,[251,403,1157,213]]]'>How was it done ? By proof of declarations merely. There was much evidence of this sort reaching back for more than twenty years, and there was some evidence of the price and terms of sale; but without pausing to scrutinize it, what is conclusive against it as an attempt to establish a parol sale, is the utter want of possession taken and maintained under it. The cases cited in the argument show that this is an indispensable requisite of a parol sale. But Edmund, took possession, it is said, and kept it till he sold to Guthrie. The answer is, he had it in common with his brothers from the first, so that it wTas impossible for him to assume the possession under and in pursuance of the purchase of his brother. What, then, it is asked, can there be no sale of land <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>by parol among tenants in common where all are in possession ? Certainly not; because the statute of frauds and perjuries forbids it, and there cannot be such part performance as would take it out of the operation of that wise and salutary rule of titles : Galbreath <em>v. </em>Galbreath, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%20149" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Watts 149">5 <em>Watts </em>149</a>.</p>
    <p id="b512-6" data-blocks='[["BL_512.6",512,[250,616,1159,594]]]'>Several of the cases, cited in the paper-book, show that for the same reason a tenant in possession cannot purchase the reversion of his landlord by parol. Whilst possession, in pursuance of a parol contract, is not of itself such part performance as necessarily to take it out of the statute, it is an indispensable accompaniment of every parol contract that hopes for specific execution; and where the contracting parties already maintain such relations as to preclude the possibility of surrendering and taking possession, under, in pursuance, and by reason of the contract, they must fall back on the easy and reasonable rule of the statute, and put their contract in “writing, signed by the parties.” If, then, the defendant has failed to show a legal divesture of James’s interest, the only ground on which he can resist a recovery is the statute of limitations.</p>
    <p id="b512-7" data-blocks='[["BL_512.7",512,[249,1218,1164,1029]]]'>This action was brought in 1855. James quit the possession in 1832 or 1833, and the court seems to have assumed that the possession from that time (in Edmund and William till 1843, and since then in Guthrie) has been adverse to him. They instructed the jury, in answer to the plaintiff’s third point, that the facts in proof would amount to an ouster of James, and of course to an adverse holding by his brother and his alienee. This, though assigned for error, is not pressed in the argument. The ouster was a question of fact, and there was enough in the case to justify the court in leaving it to the jury, and to justify them in finding it. If 1833 be assumed as the period of the ouster, there were more than twenty-one years of adverse possession before this suit was brought; but it was in evidence that these plaintiffs instituted an ejectment for the same land on the 3d December, 1853, and suffered nonsuit therein on the 4th September, 1854. William H. Lowry also swore that he had a survey made for the Workman family in 1854 — or the fall of 1853 — that before the suit of 1853 was brought, he made an entry to forbid the cutting of timber, and forbid one Ben Davis, who was there. He said he was acting under a power of attorney, but when it was given in evidence, on the part of the defendants, it appeared to be from William B. Workman and H. Weir Workman, attorney for James C. Workman, administrator of Edmund Workman, deceased, dated 6th May, 1853.</p>

Of course, there is no assignment of error on this instruction, but <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>as the cause is to go back for another trial, we think it proper to say that we consider the court in error on this point.</p>
    <p id="b513-6" data-blocks='[["BL_513.6",513,[198,498,1160,332]]]'>An entry by the true owner can alone toll the statute, and if we understand Lowry’s agency aright, he was not acting for James C. Workman in his own right, but only in his representative capacity, as the administrator of his deceased brother Edmund. Lowry’s entry, even if the facts were sufficient to constitute it such an one as would toll the statute, was Edmund’s rather than James’s entry. It cannot, therefore, avail the title of the latter.</p>
    <p id="b513-7" data-blocks='[["BL_513.7",513,[197,842,1158,127]]]'>As to the ejectment of 1853, the law is, that an unsuccessful suit leading to no change of possession, does not stop the running of the statute: <a href="/citations/?q=19%20Howard%2071" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="19 Howard 71">19 <em>Howard </em>71</a>; 1 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>237.</p>

Whether he might not have been defeated on the statute of limitations, the erroneous ruling of the court in reference to the effect of Lowry’s entry and the prior ejectment, has rendered it impossible for us to determine. The case should be tried as to him upon the statute of limitations, and then all the questions, ouster, adverse holding, and re-entry, can be fairly met and properly disposed of.</p>
