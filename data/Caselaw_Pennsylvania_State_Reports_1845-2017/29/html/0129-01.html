The right vested in the qualified voters of the several districts has been exercised, and the majority have chosen their judge. Where is the power of the legislature to alter the district after such election <em>? </em>By what authority does the legislature presume to abridge or nullify the right of any county to a voice in the election of the judge who is to preside in such county, and in whose election the constitution provides they shall have a voice ?

The plea of the defendant is simply, and nothing more than, a challenge to the president judge which could not be allowed: 3 <em>Bl. Com. </em>861.

It cannot be contended that he was not a judge <em>de facto ; </em>and that being the case, his title to the office can only be determined by <em>quo warranto </em>in the Supreme Court. But he was a judge <em>de jure. </em>He was duly elected, by the qualified voters, president judge of the 8th judicial district, and that is the office which he now holds. The legislature added the county of Mon-tour to his district, in the exercise of a power which it is absolutely necessary they should possess, and which is denied to them by no section of the constitution.

J. Tilghman says (page 400), “when the present constitution'was framed, it was well understood that the power of altering counties had always been exercised by the legislature, and that it was necessary that power should continue. It was understood, too, that certáin consequences necessarily flowed from the alteration of counties. In construing the constitution, therefore, we must take care not to destroy those implied powers, without which society could not exist.” All this applies as strongly to the alteration of judicial districts. In this case, it was decided that a justice of the peace, commissioned during good behaviour, who resided in the part cut off from the county, for which he was commissioned, ceased to be a justice — that the jurisdiction of a justice of the peace increased or diminished as the county increased or diminished. On the same <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>principle Judge Conyngham’s jurisdiction decreased, when Mon-tour county was taken from his district, and Judge Jordan’s was increased, when the same county was added to his, and the vested rights of no one were affected by the change.</p>

The Act of 18th Feb<a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>ruary, 1785, in its title and preamble, shows that it was designed to prevent “ <em>wrongful” </em>restraints of liberty. The third section, after providing that any person committed for treason or felony, and not tried some time in the next term, session of Oyer and Terminer, general jail delivery, or other court after such commitment, shall, upon the last day of the term, sessions, or court be set at liberty upon bail, goes on to say: “ and if such prisoner shall not be indicted and tried the second term, sessions, or court after his or her commitment, unless the delay happen on the application, or with the assent of the defendant, or upon trial shall be acquitted, he or she shall be discharged from imprisonment.” Now, the evident construction of this section is, that the “term, session, or court” intended by the act is a legally constituted and competent term, session, or court. It meant that a prosecutor should not allow two such terms or sessions of the court, at each of which the defendant might be legally indicted or tried, to elapse without bringing on the prosecution. But' to constitute a <em>competent </em>court, several things are necessary: the presence of the president judge and jurors, grand and petit, drawn, summoned, and impannelled according to law. Time is another legal requisite. Many president judges are required to hold Courts of Oyer and Terminer in different counties on certain prefixed days; and if the number or duration of trials in one county prevent him from trying all the cases before the law requires his presence elsewhere, the prisoners, whom it has been impossible to try, are not to take advantage of this ineffectual term to claim their release. It is only after two terms, at both of which it was possible to indict and try them according to law, that they become entitled to a discharge. The statute was made to restrain the malice and oppression of prosecutors, and to relieve <em>wrongful </em>imprisonment; not to embarrass the administration of the criminal law; not to relieve righteous imprisonment, and to defeat public justice. Such was the construction which this section received from this court in the case of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>The Sheriff and Jailer of Allegheny County, 16 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>304, wherein it was held that a prisoner indicted for aiding and abetting another to commit murder, and not tried at the second term, was not entitled to his discharge on <em>habeas corpus </em>when proceedings to outlawry against the principal had been commenced without delay, but there had not been time to finish them. The language of Judge Todd, speaking for the whole court, was very much in point: “ What, then,” said he, “ was the third section of the act intended to provide against ? I think it was intended to provide against the abuse of procrastinated trial, to provide not only against the malice of the prosecutor, and against his negligence, against all <em>Ms </em>delays with cause or without cause, against every possible act or want of action of <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>the prosecutor; but not to shield a prisoner <em>in any case from the consequences of any delay made necessary by the law itself.”</em>

    <p id="b136-7" data-blocks='[["BL_136.7",136,[274,628,1158,644]]]'>If, then, this prisoner, instead of appealing to the court as upon <em>habeas </em>corpus, had pleaded his new trial at the September and December Terms which elapsed after his full commitment, and thus had brought the question upon the present record, it could not have availed him. It may be well doubted whether upon demurrer such a plea would not have been set aside as wholly insufficient to bar the prosecution, but it is certain the plea would have been fully answered by a replication that no legal panel of jurors had been summoned at these terms. And if to such a replication the defendant had demurred, judgment must inevitably have gone against him, for the delay would have been attributable to the law itself. A panel of jurors, constituted according to law, was as necessary an ingredient of a competent court as the president judge himself; and delay in constituting it was as truly the law’s delay as that which is caused by the necessary forms of outlawry.</p>
    <p id="b136-8" data-blocks='[["BL_136.8",136,[271,1272,1158,597]]]'>It is no answer to urge that the sheriff and commissioners, who were the officers of the law, caused the delay by not drawing and summoning jurors aright. The statute which the prisoner invokes was not designed to give <em>him </em>this benefit of official negligence. As a member of society he was represented by those officers ; and when he entered upon a course of crime, and placed himself in antagonism to society, he assumed the risk of their performing their duties so faithfully as to speed the penalty. It seems to his advantage that they did not — but to his advantage only in giving him more time for repentance — not as furnishing grounds for his discharge. The dilatoriness of the agents, who in some sense were his own agents, cannot cancel his responsibilities to society. He is not in position to take advantage of it in the manner proposed.</p>

The provision is directory merely. And to be a mark of identity, <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>it is necessary that the addition or occupation shall be written as it is commonly known in the community from which the juror is drawn. There is no question about the identity of this juror. It is not pretended that there is any other Mathew S. itidgway in Montour county. His Christian and surnames, therefore, sufficiently indicate him; but lest some other man of the same name should be found, the statute required his addition or occupation to be expressed in the language in which it is commonly known. A precisely descriptive addition might not indicate him at all, simply because his neighbours were not accustomed so to think and speak of him. “ Mill Boss,” we take it for granted, was the popular designation of his occupation; and therefore it is quite immaterial whether the words are capable of strict definition as applicable to a rolling-mill, or a mill of any other description, they were the appropriate words for the occasion.</p>

It denies that Judge Jordan, whom it recognises as “ acting as president judge of the court here,” was ever elected a judge of the Court of Oyer and Terminer of Montour county, agreeably to the constitution and laws of the Commonwealth; and alleges that Montour county, at the time of the election of judges, formed no part of Judge Jordan’s district, but belonged to and formed part of the 11th judicial district, composed of the counties of Luzerne, Wyoming, Columbia, and Montour; and that Judge Conyngham was duly elected president judge of said district.</p>

The notion that the functions of a public officer, or of a corporation existing by authority of law, can be drawn in question (I do not mean as to the mode of their exercise, but as to their right of existence), except at the pleasure of the sovereign, is a mistake that springs from the too prevalent misconception that it is the duty of everybody to attend to public affairs.
