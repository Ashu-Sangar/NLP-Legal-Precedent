In the July of 1854, James and Andrew met at our office, or in the office of A. Leech &amp; Co., which was in the front room, and ours in the back room. James knew that the firm of A. Leech and Robt. D. Thompson was in failing circumstances. James then took from them the <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>judgment-bond, on which the judgment read in evidence was entered ; which bond, by express agreement of the parties, contained the whole amount due to James, from all the partnerships or firms, from 1850 up to that time. My brother and I were attorneys for A. Leech, Jr. &amp; Co., and we urged James to enter up judgment, and issue execution immediately, and secure his claim, by levying on the property of defendants. But he refused to issue, because he did not wish to distress his brother.

Thompson, for which the receipt of October 1, 1858, was given, nor the judgment-bond and judgment entered thereon, as given in evidence, would either, or both, constitute a bar to the plaintiff’s right to recover in this action, in themselves alone. But if, at the time these notes or this bond were taken, it was the agreement of the parties to these instruments that the estate of George Collier should be released from all liability on account of this claim, then the plaintiff will not be entitled to recover. The fact testified to by Mr. Bell, if believed by the jury, that the judgment embraced the whole claim of plaintiff, now sought to be recovered, would form a sufficient consideration for an agreement to release Collier’s estate, because Thompson, one of the parties who gave the judgment,. was not responsible for that portion of plaintiff’s claim which accrued between the 1st of January, 1850, and the fall of 1851, when he came into the firm.</p>
