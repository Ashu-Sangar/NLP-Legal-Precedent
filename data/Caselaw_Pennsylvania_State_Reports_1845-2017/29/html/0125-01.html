The store had previously been carried on by Rank and William A. Magee. Under the agreement by which Magee retired, and Roland came into the firm, Rank &amp; Roland agreed to pay the debts owing by Rank &amp; Magee. Charles Roland procured from his father, John Roland, $1000, a few days after the partnership was formed, and gave his note, dated 1st April, 1856, for the amount. John Roland also became surety for Rank &amp; Roland to the amount pf $700. The money thus received from John Roland, and borrowed by the firm, went into the operations of the firm, and was principally appropriated to pay debts owing by Rank &amp; Magee. On the 15th August, 1856, Rank &amp; Roland, being embarrassed, confessed a judgment to John Roland for $1722.50. On this judgment and others executions were issued, and the property of the firm levied and sold, and the proceeds were in court for distribution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b125-10" data-blocks='[["BL_125.10",125,[207,1701,1161,558]]]'>A petition was presented to the court, signed by the attorneys of the plaintiffs, creditors of Rank &amp; Roland, alleging that the judgment in favour of John Roland was fraudulent and void, and for the purpose of hindering and delaying the creditors of Rank &amp; Roland. An affidavit was made by William A. Magee, who was not a party to the issue, nor an execution-creditor, but interested in having the money appropriated to the debts of Rank &amp; Magee, assumed by Rank &amp; Roland. Thereupon the court directed this issue. On the trial, in the court below, the defendants’ counsel moved to strike off the issue as having been improvidently awarded, upon the petition of the counsel instead of the parties, and sworn to by a person not a party to the petition or the issue. This motion was refused by the court.</p>

Let us get clear of the artificial form of the feigned issue, and take the evidence in its natural order. The contesting creditors were made the plaintiffs, because it was necessary for them to cast such doubt upon this claim as to throw upon the claimant the burden of proving it. We assume that they did so, when they proved his declarations that he had given his son $1000 to start in business, and then showed that that sum was afterwards included in the contested judgment.</p>
    <p id="b127-9" data-blocks='[["BL_127.13",127,[208,1393,1165,470]]]'>But when the claimant, on his part, proved that in fact he had lent the money to his son, and taken his note for it at the time, then the suspicion, founded on his declarations, was completely removed; for then it was shown how he had given it. The very indefinite word “give” was found to express the truth, and yet not to invoke the idea of <em>a gift. </em>This father seems to have been thinking of the instruction, which might be useful to many others : “ Give not thy son power over thee whilst thou livest; for it is better that thy children should look to thee, than that thou shouldst look to their hands. When thou shalt end thy days and finish thy life, distribute thine inheritance:” <em>Ecclus. </em>xxxiii. 19-23.</p>
    <p id="b127-10" data-blocks='[["BL_127.14",127,[211,1861,1161,337]]]'>After the claimant’s evidence was in, it was <em>it </em>that the contestants were called upon to meet. That could not be done by the loose declarations about giving, which were perfectly consistent with the claimant’s evidence, but by directly meeting his evidence of a loan, and showing that it did not present the true state of the case. If he took a note from his son when he gave him the money, the transaction cannot be converted into a gift by such loose talk as we have here.</p>
