The agreement provided that the value of the stock should be paid by the company to the defendants as soon as <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>the value could be ascertained by persons mutually chosen, so far as it was not agreed upon by the parties at the time of making out the schedule.

A few days after this sale Hoban, by the direction of Frost, took a portion of the horses and mules to Abner Garrison’s, in Greene county, Pennsylvania, for the purpose of being pastured there. Two men of the names of Born and Irwin, who had been employed by Pettibone, Hoban &amp; Co., continued in charge of the horses and mules, and accompanied them to Garrison’s, in the employ of Frost, the engineer of the company. A few days after the sale, Manning paid to the defendants eight thousand dollars, and took a receipt on account of the purchase of this property. At the time of the sale, and the transfer of the property, Manning, the engineer, gave permission to Pettibone, Hoban &amp; Co. to use the property for a few days, until the money should be paid, to keep the hands employed, and to prevent difficulty with and clamour among the labourers. The money was paid, however, before the horses and mules were sent to Garrison’s. While the horses and mules were there in pasture, this attachment was laid.</p>

When from the nature of the transaction, possession either could not be delivered at all, or, at least without defeating fair and honest objects intended to be effected by, and which constituted the motive for entering into, the contract, the cause might be regarded as an exception to the rule. Where possession has been withheld from the vendee, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, some good reason for the arrangement beyond the convenience of the parties should appear: Clow <em>et al. v. </em>Woods, 5 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>273. But this rule does not appear to prevail in Virginia: Davis <em>v. </em>Turner, 4 <em>Grattan </em>422. In that state the rule is, the retention of possession of personal property by the vendors, after an absolute sale, is <em>prima facie </em>fraudulent, but the presumption may be rebutted by proof. In this case the parties to the sale, and the property which was the subject of it, were within the jurisdiction of Virginia when the sale was made; but the property, consisting of horses and mules, was subsequently sent over the state' line into Pennsylvania to be pastured. The question is, whether on an attachment in Pennsylvania, by a creditor of the vendor, the validity of the sale shall be tested by the law of Virginia or by that of Pennsylvania. If there had been a previous sale by the owners at their place of domicil, and the contest was between the prior and subsequent purchase, a very different question would be presented. So, if the property had been situated within the jurisdiction of Pennsylvania at the time of the sale in Virginia, the <em>lex rei sites </em>might be applied for the purpose of protecting the rights of our own citizens. But where the property and the parties to the sale were within the jurisdiction of another state, when the contract was made and executed according to the laws of that state, the right vested <em>eo instanti </em>in the purchaser, and no subsequent removal of the property into Pennsylvania for a lawful purpose, can divest it. The subsequent removal of the horses and mules for the purpose of pasturing them in Pennsylvania, was no violation of our policy, nor of the rights of our citizens. They had no claims upon it under our laws when the sale was made, because it was not in any respect subject to our jurisdiction. Their claims upon it were under the laws of Virginia, and the court fell into error in holding that the validity of the sale was to be tested by the law of Pennsylvania: Thuret <em>v. </em>Jackson, <a href="/mart-os/7/0318-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="7 Mart. 318" data-case-ids="6684106" data-case-paths="/mart-os/7/0318-01">7 <em>Martin </em>318</a>; Scott <em>v. </em>Duffy, 2 <em>Harris </em>18; Shelby <em>v. </em>Guy, <a href="/us/24/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="43" data-cite="11 Wheat. 361" data-case-ids="1428694" data-case-paths="/us/24/0361-01">11 <em>Wheat. </em>361</a>. By the common law a debtor has a right to prefer one class of creditors to another; and we think it was error to encourage the jury to take into con<a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>sideration the exercise of this right, as “a circumstance of suspicion,” in deciding upon the fairness of the transfer.</p>
