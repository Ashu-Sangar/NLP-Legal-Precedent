The defendant is a corporation chartered in 1843, and organized on the mutual plan, each insurer being a member of the corporation. Its corporate powers are vested in a board of thirteen managers, who are elected annually. The company has no capital stock, but defrays all expenses and losses by assessments on the members. By the seventh section of the charter, “ any member who shall sustain loss by fire shall give immediate notice to the president of the company, who shall appoint a committee of three of the managers, that shall examine and inquire into the same; and the said managers, with all convenient expedition, shall inquire into the same, and after ascertaining the sum which said party shall be lawfully entitled to, shall make provision and payment as specified.”</p>

Information of the fact was communicated to the company, and on the 21st of the same month, the president appointed a committee of three managers, under the seventh section of the charter above quoted, who met on the 24th of the same month on the premises. The committee adjourned to meet in Reading, at the annual meeting <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>of the company, on the 1st Monday of November, 1854. The plaintiff did not attend this adjourned meeting, and on the 15th November, 1854, the committee again met at his residence to ascertain the loss. They made a report to the president, by which they award “the sum of $1000 for the loss sustained, to wit: the sum of $500 for the buildings, and the sum of $500 for the household goods and kitchen furniture, &amp;c., therein destroyed, and direct the treasurer to pay the said amount to the said Benjamin Rupp, or his assignees, &amp;c., out of the funds received from assessment No. 8, now to be levied by the company to meet this, with other losses lately sustained by members of the said company.” The plaintiff, claiming that his loss greatly exceeded the amount reported by the committee, refused to receive the same; and the company refusing to pay any greater sum, this action was brought.</p>

There is no provision in the 7th section that it is to be binding and conclusive; and I am of opinion that the power given to a committee to examine, and to the managers to inquire and ascertain, was for a different purpose than to make the ascertainment conclusive on both parties. I do not think, therefore, that this 2d point of defendant is well taken, and I answer it therefore in the negative.</p>

He was a member of the corporation, for it was organized on the principle of mutuality, and he was bound by its charter and by-laws. What of that ? If the association had been a partnership, and he had set his hand to the very words on which the question is supposed to hinge, it is more than doubtful whether they contain anything sufficient to oust the jurisdiction of the courts of justice. It is not necessary to go far for the reasons. The plaintiff had no hand in selecting the committee. It was done by the president of the company, which, though entitled to hold the plaintiff' as a member, was nevertheless his adversary. The men who were constituted his judges were interested to diminish his claim, for they were liable to pay their proportionate part of the assessment necessary to meet it. No notice of their meeting was given. No hearing of both sides was enjoined. No system of evidence was provided. The testimony of other members as interested as the tribunal was probably received. The by-laws seem to require an oath, but an oath without cross-examination is of little efficacy in developing the truth. The duties of the committee are plain. They are to examine and inquire into the loss. No report is necessary. They are to ascertain the sum to which the party is entitled, and make provision for its payment. There is no decision or award in the legal acceptation of those terms, and consequently no right of appeal by exception from the committee to the board. Nor is there any appeal respecting the form or substance of the committee’s action to any other tribunal. The law looks with a jealous eye on the very best appointed machinery for forestalling its own action in its own way, because it will ordinarily be found that those institutions which have been sanctioned by the wisdom of ages, and adopted generally by civilized man, are better than the crude experiments of a day. If justified in delegating its functions at all, such a tribunal as this ought not to be selected. With what powers then did the legislature clothe the committee ? Simply to inquire into the loss and ascertain a sum which should form the basis of an assessment. If the claimant accept it, well; if he proceed adversely and change the amount, their work is to be done over. In no event can that which was intended for the convenience of the company be turned into an act binding on the assured and the court. This is the only point worthy of discussion.</p>
