      <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>This was an action of trespass by William S. Lane, assignee of R. H. Hodge, against Thomas B. Vincent and Guy Loomis. Loomis, prior to December, 1853, had been engaged in the business of a jeweller, at the city of Erie, and had on hand a valuable stock of jewelry, watches, &amp;c. About that time Hodge, who had previously resided in the state of New York, .came to Erie, and entered into negotiations with Loomis for the purchase of his stock. The bargain was finally closed on the 12th December, 1853, at $5525.82, $2000 of which were to be paid in hand, and. the balance in three equal payments, at six, nine, and twelve months. The hand-money was paid, and to secure Loomis for the balance, Hodge gave him a judgment-bond in the penalty of $5000, conditioned to pay as before stated. The payment falling due at the end of six months, was met by Hodge. On the 9th day of September, 1854, Hodge made a voluntary assignment for the benefit of his creditors to William S. Lane, Esq., who accepted the trust, and took possession of the store. Loomis on the same day entered up his judgment, and issued a <em>fi.fa. </em>upon it, and under it the jewelry and watches were seized and sold by the sheriff for the sum of $3166.30. The Court of Common Pleas set aside this j^. <em>fa., </em>because it had issued before the second instalment was due; and this ruling was affirmed by the Supreme Court.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b243-6" data-blocks='[["BL_243.6",243,[208,1429,1158,171]]]'>This action of trespass was then brought against the plaintiff in that writ, and the sheriff, by the assignee to recover the value of the goods taken and sold, they having been previously vested in him under the voluntary assignment.</p>

That afterwards he paid to Loomis $1178. That he privately sent off, or delivered to his brother, a large amount of jewelry, who carried the same away, and that he then represented that he had been indebted some $800 to his brother before he bought of Loomis. That three days before the instalment fell due in September, 1854, to wit, on the 9th day of September, 1854, while there were no debts in Erie pressing, no judg<a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>ment against him for any sum whatever, no creditors claiming money from him, he made an assignment for the benefit of creditors to the plaintiff in this case, declaring at the same time that Loomis “ should not get the advantage of him.” That he followed the business of a jeweller from the date of his purchase, the 12th of December, 1853, up to the sale, the 9th of September, 1854, and that the same was a profitable business, and that he met with no known loss while so engaged in the business. This is in substance what we will prove, for the purpose of showing the fraudulent intent of the assignor.</p>

      <em>Defendant’s points. </em>— First. The court is requested to charge the jury that the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, because the plaintiff has not shown that there were any creditors at any time for whose benefit said assignment was made, and it is incompetent for Hodge to tie up his property by assignment, particularly as it is shown that Loomis was a creditor at the time of the assignment, and is so yet; that there being no other creditor the assignment was calculated, and did delay, hinder, and defraud said Loomis.</p>

      <em>Answer of the court to defendant’s points: </em>— “ 1st. It was not necessary for the plaintiff to show, as a matter of evidence, that there were creditors of Hodges, for the purpose of a recovery, provided he has satisfied the jury that an assignment was made to him for the benefit of creditors. If this was done, and the defendant, claiming to be a creditor of the assignor, issued a <em>fi. fa. </em>on the judgment he had against him, before the money was due, and levied upon and sold the goods assigned, he was a trespasser, and therefore answerable in damages to the amount of the real injury sustained. This point is consequently answered in the negative.</p>

The plaintiff below established his title under the assignment, and then gave evidence that Guy Loomis entered up a judgment against R. H. Hodge, by virtue of a warrant of attorney annexed to a bond, and issued a <em>fi. fa. </em>to levy an instalment mentioned in the condition, three days before the said instalment was due by the terms of the said contract. It was also shown that the goods of the assignee had been seized and sold under this execution, thus prematurely issued, and that after the sale, the Court of Common Pleas, on a full hearing of the parties, ordered the execution to be set aside. That decision was afterwards affirmed on error by this court. There is no separate defence raised in behalf of the sheriff. He therefore stands or falls with the plaintiff in the execution; and the question below was whether the latter, after the wrrit had been set aside by the court, would be permitted to re-examine the justice of that decision, and for that purpose to give evidence that the credit had been obtained for the periods named in the condition of the bond by the false representations of Hodge respecting his solvency.</p>
