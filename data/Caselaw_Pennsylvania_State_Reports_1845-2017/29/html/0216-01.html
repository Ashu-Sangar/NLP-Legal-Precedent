The defendants below, by articles of agreement dated the 7th day of December, 1845, sold to Alexander Crow and John Hanaway a tract of land for the sum of $2350, payable four days thereafter. On the day after the date of the article, John Hanaway paid on the same $1000, and on the next day assigned his contract to Alexander Crow. The article of agreement was recorded on the 8th day of June, 1847. John Hanaway was married, and had a wife and children at the time of the purchase and sale; he died, after the transfer to Crow, leaving his widow and children surviving.</p>

In January, 1851, Alexander Crow procured a deed to be prepared to himself, with clause of general warranty, and tendered the same to the defendants to be executed. This Thomas Morris refused to do, whereupon Crow brought this suit. Alexander Crow furnished the $1000, paid by Hanaway on the 8th December, 1845. The remainder of the purchase-money had been paid by Alexander Crow, as appears from Michael Crow’s testimony, which is as follows:—</p>

We do not think this a material error, if error there was, which is by no means certain; for conceding that the purchase was made by Crow and Hanaway, for their mutual benefit, the assignment made by Hanaway to Crow the day after the purchase vested the entire equitable estate in Crow, and- upon payment of the residue of the purchase-money he was entitled to a separate conveyance.</p>
    <p id="b218-10" data-blocks='[["BL_218.16",218,[257,1382,1164,461]]]'>All of the vendors appear to have been willing to execute the deed to Crow alone, except Thomas Morris; who seems to have laboured under the belief that a separate conveyance to Crow would in some way affect the rights of Mrs. Hanaway to dower. In this he was mistaken. Mrs. Hanaway had no interest to be affected, and even if it were otherwise she could not have been influenced by the transfer of the legal title to Crow. We have no doubt of the power of a court of law to enforce performance of this contract, through the medium of a conditional verdict; and we think, under the evidence, the plaintiff was clearly entitled to recover.</p>
