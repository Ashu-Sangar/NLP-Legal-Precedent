Denny, on the 31st day of May, 1856, against Robert M. Brunson, in which the complainant alleged that she was the owner of a farm in Indiana township, Allegheny county, containing about 600 acres, and highly improved, on which were erected a mansion-house, a number of tenant-houses, a grist-mill, &amp;c. She alleged that Brunson, ‘ sometime in the winter of 1856, had entered upon a portion of the farm and committed great damage, by cutting, barking, and <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>felling timber and ornamental trees, and by cutting and burning the same, and by hauling them away and selling and disposing of them to his own use. And that by burning the same he greatly endangered the safety of the mill, from sparks and cinders. That having been notified and warned by her, he refused to desist from such unlawful acts, and that on the 21st May, 1856, she brought an action of trespass against him. But that instead of ceasing, he had employed additional hands, and was then more rapidly and ruthlessly injuring and destroying the farm and the forest trees growing thereon. And prayed for a writ of <em>subpoena </em>in the ordinary form, and for a preliminary injunction, and that on the final hearing the same might be made perpetual. On the same day the court granted the preliminary injunction as prayed for.</p>

The acts complained of and proved constitute waste, and the only question of any importance on the record is, whether the powers of courts of equity to restrain waste by injunction have been extended to and vested in our courts.</p>
    <p id="b384-15" data-blocks='[["BL_384.17",384,[254,1389,1153,256]]]'>The jurisdiction of English equity in cases of waste began with the injunction <em>pendente </em>lite, but has long since extended itself to cases where no action at law was pending, but where it was needed for the protection of trust estates and estates in reversion and remainder, and has now become one of the well defined branches of equity jurisprudence.</p>
    <p id="b384-16" data-blocks='[["BL_384.18",384,[254,1646,1150,255]]]'>But do our Pennsylvania courts possess it ? If they do, it is conferred by the second enumeration contained in the 13th section of the Act of 16th June, 1836, which extends our equity jurisdiction to “ the prevention or restraint of the commission or continuance of acts contrary to law and prejudicial to the interests of the community or the rights of individuals.”</p>

The peculiarity of waste is, that the party committing it may be in rightful possession of the premises, and therefore the legal remedies, except in cases to which estrepement has been specifically applied, can only punish the act when it is done, and cannot restrain it from being done. Injunction is effectual to restrain it in all cases.</p>
