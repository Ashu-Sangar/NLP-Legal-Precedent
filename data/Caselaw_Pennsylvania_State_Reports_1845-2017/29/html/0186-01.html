    <p id="b187-6" data-blocks='[["BL_187.8",187,[224,757,1160,556]]]'>The presumption in the absence of proof is, that the note was endorsed while current. The burden of proving the contrary is on the defendant. Suspicious circumstances may shift this. And in this case, it is attempted to be drawn from the want of demand, protest, and notice; and the lapse of time between its maturity and the commencement of this action. There may be good -reasons why it was not protested — as the insolvency of the endorser, or the undoubted security of the acceptor or maker. The want of notice, and delay in bringing suit, are only suspicious ■when the delay is unreasonable and the demand stale. In Snyder <em>v. </em>Riley, 6 <em>Barr </em>168, the note was due three years before suit; and in Innes <em>v. </em>Way, 1 <em>Harris, </em>six years. The delay here was only about six months.</p>

Before the commencement of the present suit, and before any notice was given that the note had been transferred by Clark to Hill, judgment was obtained in the attachment suit against the garnishees for the amount of the note in question. Upon the trial of the case at bar, no evidence was given when the note was endorsed by Clark to Hill, whether before or after maturity. Nor did it appear that any demand was made upon the makers for payment, or that notice of nonpayment was given to the' endorser. The note matured on the 17th July, 1854, and this action was brought to April Term, 1855.</p>

And it is equally well settled, that such attachment is worthless as against a holder to whom the note had been negotiated before its maturity without actual notice of the attachment, even though the attachment preceded the endorsement. The doctrine of notice by <em>lis pendens </em>does not apply to such a case: Kieffer <em>v. </em>Ehler, 6 <em>Harris </em>388. But if the note in ques- ' tion was owned by Clark when attached, and was not transferred by him to Hill until after it was due, the judgment in the attachment is a good defence to the present action. And this brings us to the real question in the cause. Upon whom was the burden of proof, to show the time of the endorsement ?</p>
