She filed her account, which was, on the 27th day of March, 1854, confirmed by the court; and on the 25th November, 1854, the court appointed an auditor to make <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>distribution of the fund — $427.96—in the hands of the administratrix.-</p>

Springer paid $30 in hand, the balance to be paid in annual payments of $50 each, with interest. On the 1st day of November, 1849, Springer assigned his interest in the property and agreement to James McCracken, who took possession, subject to the payment of the unpaid purchase-money to Socin. McCracken, in his lifetime, paid to Socin three of the annual $50 instalments, with interest. Hines, who came into possession as vendee of McCracken’s devisees, paid two years’ interest on the balance, leaving unpaid to Socin $250, with interest, from April 1, 1854; which sum the administrators of Socin’s estate claimed should be allowed to them out of the fund for distribution. The will of James McCracken contained the following clause:—</p>

We think it was; for though McCracken did not bind himself by covenant to pay the balance of the purchase-money due to Socin, yet by buying the equitable title, and getting the assignment of the articles from Springer, he impliedly undertook to pay the balance, and keep Springer clear of it. His debt or duty was directly to Springer, and through him to Socin.</p>

In giving the land, he speaks of it as though his title was complete, and most likely he expected to complete it before his death. Moreover, he gives it along with other ground, to which his title was complete, and directs the whole to be equally divided among the devisees, and expressly charges the whole with another legacy. We think the residuary fund must pay the debt of Socin.</p>
