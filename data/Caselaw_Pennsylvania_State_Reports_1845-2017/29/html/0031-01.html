On the 18th July, 1848, the plaintiff effected an insurance, in the company of the defendants, on a frame house, situate in the borough of Lewistown, for the sum of $1000, being two-thirds of the estimated value, for five years. The resident agent of the company went upon the premises and filled up the description and application, and upon that the policy was issued. At the time of the application the plaintiff resided in the house, and it was occupied by him as a fancy, variety, and confectionery store, and as a mineral water manufactory, bath-house, &amp;c. The building was consumed by fire on the night of the 9th April, 1852, and this action was brought to recover the amount of the insurance.</p>

They alleged that the plaintiff offered to sell the lot with the buildings, previous to the destruction of the latter, for the sum of fifteen hundred dollars, and that the lot was subsequently sold for $900, and that, in consequence of such over-estimate, the policy was void. The defendant gave evidence to prove the value of the buildings.

The plaintiff, a short time before the fire, had removed from the premises, and they were vacant at the time the fire occurred.

In such case it would avoid the policy.

But if he did not know it was material to the risk, and the agent who did is on the premises to examine for himself and does not bring it to his knowledge, and an oven being a matter open to view, the omission of the plaintiff to make it known to the company, and that they were frequently used on the premises, would not avoid the policy or defeat the plaintiff’s right to recover.</p>

If you find that it did so increase the risk and hazard according to the class of hazards and rates adopted by the company, without their consent and agreement, the plaintiff will not be entitled to recover. But if it did not increase the risk and hazard according to their by-laws, the policy would cease to have force and effect, and the plaintiff would not be defeated in his action. The general principle contended for by this point is applicable to a policy stipulating a purpose for which the property insured is to be occupied, and not merely reciting how it is used at the time of the policy being taken. And if you find that such change and conversion did increase the risk — to defeat the plaintiff’s recovery on this ground, you must find that he continued such change and conversion of the property to the time of the fire, for by the terms of the charter it is only during the continuance of such change and conversion that the policy shall cease and be of no effect or force.</p>

It was there held that where the conditions of insurance required that notice of loss should be given forthwith, and it appeared that officers of'the insurers were on the ground of the fire the day after the fire, for the purpose of examining into the matter, it was sufficient evidence of notice, (2 <em>U.

Evidently it was not intended to describe the hazards, nor could it have been so received; for neither the use nor the material of the adjoining houses is given, nor anything like an adequate specification of the use and internal structure of the houses insured. The use of one of them is mentioned, another is called a stable, and the use of two others may be guessed at from the kind of personal property insured in them.
