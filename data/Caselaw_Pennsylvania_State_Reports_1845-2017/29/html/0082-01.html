The work to be finished according to specifications annexed, and the directions of the engineer, on or before the first day of August, 1854.

Upon this new route the contractors commenced work, and their monthly estimates were made out according to the contract prices, and payments made upon these estimates as the work progressed. After one or two estimates Malone and Barry retired, and Cassidy and Reilly took their places, the work as before being carried on in the name of Richard McGrann &amp; Co. The third estimate was made of the work done to the 1st February, 1854, at the rates fixed by the agreement for the several kinds of work. On this estimate $7112.82 was paid to the contractors, and they receipted for it on the foot of the estimate in full of the above estimate and according to contract.

This is an axiom of law well established. We are further requested to instruct you that as there was an agreement in this case under seal, between the defendant and two of the plaintiffs, in conjunction with two other parties, for the construction of the road, this action cannot be sustained, and that the verdict must be for the defendant. If there was an absence of any circumstances or agreement which would interfere with or materially alter the sealed agreement, the defendant would be entitled to the instruction which he requests the court to give; but under the evidence and circumstances before the court, I cannot give you this instruction. It is true that there was a written contract under seal, by two of the plaintiffs in conjunction with two others, with the defendant for the construction of the North Lebanon Railroad Company, but it is shown by the testimony that the contracted route was changed after the contract was entered into, and Mr. Worrall, the engineer, tells you that the contracted route was different from the one made, the route was entirely changed with the present or constructed road. It was as different as it could well be, having the same termini. The whole was changed with a small exception. The diagram exhibiting the different routes, has been shown to you, and you will perceive the change of the route, 'as laid down. If, therefore, the change of this road amounted to a new road, and was essentially and materially different from the road contracted for, this action can be maintained, and the plaintiffs can recover what they are entitled to for the work done by them. Where the stipulations of a sealed instrument have been changed or modified, it is often difficult to discover whether such modification so essentially or materially alters the character of the writing as would justify a court, if such modification was made by parol, to turn the whole contract into a parol contract, upon which to base an action of <em>assumpsit. </em>It has been held that a mere additional parol agreement, not changing or modifying the one under seal, will not have the effect of turning the whole in parol (Ellmaker <em>v. </em>The Franklin Fire Insurance Company, 6 <em>W. </em>
      <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>
      <em>‡ S. </em>439), nor will a stipulation by parol releasing or waiving the performance of part of the covenant: McComb <em>v. </em>McKennan, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20217" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 217">2 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>217</a>; Lawall <em>v. </em>Rader, 12 <em>Harris </em>283. The change made in the contract before us is not embraced by any of these exceptions. ‘ The test of collision established by the Supreme Court appears to be this, was the capacity of the two contracts to be executed together; where that can be done the one is not substituted for the other, and where there is in fact substitution it operates as an abandonment, the specialty being relinquished, except as matter of reference for the terms of the parol contract which has supplanted it.’ Now let us apply this test to the case in hand. Here, there was a sealed contract, but it could not be executed without complete performance of the constructed route, while it would appear from the evidence furnished by the delineation on the map, as well as the other testimony given, so to affect the original as to destroy its character as a specialty, and we therefore instruct you that this action can be maintained. With regard to the second and third points of the defendant, although the written contract contains stipulations or provisions which would warrant the deductions which the counsel for the defendant have arrived at, and as embodied in those points, yet after the change which was made in the constructed route, differing so materially from the route that was contracted for, it amounts in my opinion to a rescission of that contract, unless the plaintiffs by their acts and conduct adopted those provisions, or any part of them; and my confidence in this view is more strongly confirmed, in consideration of the testimony of Mr. Worrall, who was the chief engineer, and who was the person designated in the written contract to perform certain acts, to which the points refer. He says, ‘ there is a provision in the contract that if there is a difference, the engineer shall fix the prices. This alteration was not deemed necessary by me, nor made by my direction, as I considered the alteration beyond my power as not coming within the purview of that provision, and therefore could make no allowance.’ In view, therefore, of all these circumstances, I answer these two points in the negative.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b86-4" data-blocks='[["BL_86.5",86,[262,1939,1156,214]]]'>“As to the 4th point, my answer is, that the jury are to determine from the evidence who is entitled to recover and the amount.

The prices were fixed, and certain other acts were to be done ; and if that part of the contract was not changed but acquiesced in, and agreed upon by the parties, whether it was remunerative or not, the plaintiffs and defendant are bound by such contract, so far as respects the prices agreed upon. It is true that there was a change of the contract so as to turn it from a sealed instrument into a parol agreement, yet if the evidence shows to your satisfaction that part of the stipulations or provisions contained in such contract, it was the understanding and agreement that such provisions should remain in force, then the parties would have to be governed by such stipulations. If you believe that both parties assented according to the testimony that the work should go forward at the prices mentioned in the written contract, if they were willing to submit to the written terms of that agreement as regards the price for the work, it would be a fraud upon the company to allow the plaintiffs to repudiate such agreement. Now you perceive that one very important question for your determination is, did the parties agree to stand to their written agreement as respects the prices for the work? For if that stipulation was adopted by the parties, they must be governed by it, and your verdict ought to be accordingly. If there was an agreement as to the price, such agreement must prevail. To lead you to such a conclusion, it is not necessary that a positive or express agreement should be shown to you; if such an inference can be implied from the testimony, your duty will be to render a verdict accordingly. Now to test whether the testimony goes to show such an agreement, you will take into consideration the conduct of the parties; if they acquiesced, and went on with the contract as regards the prices for the work, if no complaint was made to the managers or directors, it would be a circumstance for your consideration, when you come to deliberate upon your verdict, and to determine whether the parties considered the written contract in force as regards the prices. A mere casual complaint could not change the contract; if you believe that it was upon these terms that the work was commenced, your verdict should be accordingly. There is another circumstance upon which the defendant also relies, as an important fact, of what was the intention of the parties, that is, the receipts given by plaintiffs, and attached to the estimates. These receipts were given from time to time, as those estimates were given, except the final estimate, when the plaintiffs refused to accept, and complained of said estimate. You will recollect that to most all those receipts, if not to the whole, they say that they receipted according to contract. Now what contract do they refer to ? It appears by their own showing that there was a contract. Has any contract been shown except the written one? If that.was the one to which they had reference, it would be a strong circumstance to show that was the <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>one by which they were to be governed. It is true the receipt is not final. If it can be shown to you that it was obtained by fraud, mistake, or misrepresentation, it would not be binding, but it would <em>b&amp; prima facie </em>evidence of what is mentioned, unless you believe from the testimony that such was not the intention of the plaintiffs.</p>

Upon this new route the contractors commenced work, and after a small portion was done by the firm, Malone and Barry withdrew, and Phares Cassidy and Andrew Riley took their place; but without any change in the name of the firm, which was “McGrann &amp; Co.” The parties, plaintiffs below, proceeded with the work to completion, and then, disregarding the original agreement, bring this action on the case to recover upon a <em>quantum meruit. </em>To this the company object, contending that the action should be covenant on the sealed instrument — that the prices therein stipulated should govern, and that upon any dispute arising on the agreement, the decision of the chief engineer should be final. And to the opinion and instructions of the court below, adverse to these views, the several errors assigned apply.</p>

It is not doubted that a contract under seal may be so changed by the parties as to reduce the whole to parol. But it is not every modification that can have this effect. And when parties have evinced their desire for certainty by reducing their agreement to writing, it should require clear and explicit proof to change its character. I have looked in vain to find in the evidence any <em>express </em>agreement to abandon or modify the contract. Where, then, is the evidence from which an abandonment of its terms is to be implied ? It is true, two of the parties, contractors, withdrew, and two others took their place; but with this the company seemed to have no concern, for no new responsibility was created, nor did any change take place in the manner of doing business, as • every thing continued to be done in the name of “McGrann &amp; Oo.” It is also true that the location of the road was altered, yet the termini of <a id="p90" href="#p90" data-label="90" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*90</a>the two routes were the same, so that the change was intermediate. Now the contract provides expressly that “ the line of the road or ■the gradients may be changed if the engineer shall .consider such change necessary or expedient; and for any considerable alterations, the injury or advantage to the contractors will be estimated, and such allowance or deduction made in the price as the engineer may deem just and equitable.” Here is a provision fully meeting the change — calculated to do ample justice to the contracting parties, and precluding any inference that an alteration was not within the contemplation of the parties — a provision that no skilful or prudent engineer would omit; and such as every competent contractor would expect and understand.</p>
    <p id="ArV" data-blocks='[["BL_90.5",90,[280,969,1170,1539]],["BL_91.1",91,[198,410,1181,774]]]'>It is said by Mr. Worrall that the whole road was changed with the exception of going to the coal mines, but he admits that both had the same termini. The agreement provides that “ <em>the line of road or the gradients may he changed </em>if the engineer shall consider such change necessary or expedient.” To what can this provision apply, if not between the extreme ends ? And between these, the extent of the change is not limited; on the contrary, the engineer had the right to “ increase or diminish the length of any section— and to make such allowance or deduction in the price as he'might deem just and equitable.” Nothing is more clear than that the parties looked forward to the possible contingency of some change of route, which, so far as changed, is therefore as much within the provision of the written agreement as that first located. But the engineer says, “ this alteration was not deemed necessary, nor made by my direction, as I considered the alteration beyond my power, as not coming within the purview of the provision.” The opinion of the engineer as to his power to make the alteration, and as to what came within the purview of the provision, may have satisfied his own mind, and controlled his action, but it is not to be regarded as the law of the case. The opinion of the engineer was but advisory, and the discretionary power to change was in the directors. The clause was intended to confer upon them the right to alter the route; and the fact that it was done, is conclusive upon both parties as to its expediency — and both acting upon the contract after this change, are estopped from questioning it. When the change was made in the line of the road, if the contractors wished to abandon the contract, it was their duty to give notice to the company to this effect, but they did not — they proceeded with the work without asking a new contract. Occasionally they complained “ that they could not do the work for these prices;” and one member of the firm “ did not wish to go on,” &amp;c. Complaints on the part of contractors that they are losing, seldom create surprise, for it is not often they boast to an engineer that they are making money. One thing is certain, no new contract was made, and the evidence is much more conclusive that the work proceeded under the <em>written, </em>than under an implied contract. The <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>agreement stipulated not only the prices to be paid for the different kinds of work, but that “no claim should be allowed for extra work, unless the same was done in pursuance of a written order from the engineer in charge, and the claim made at the first settlement after the work was executed; unless the chief engineer, at. his discretion, should direct the claim, or such part of it as he might deem just and equitable, to be allowed.” No such written order was ever made. The engineer says, “ when I affixed these prices I never heard the contractors object to them.” The monthly estimates were paid and receipted for by R. McGrrann &amp; Co. “ according to contract.” The retained per centage, to secure the completion of the work, was deducted from each estimate, says the engineer, “ because it was mentioned in the contract.” He says further, “none of the contractors then insisted on having more than 68 cents (the contract price) — they never gave me notice as engineer that they would not go on at 68 cents. At the time the change was made in the location, the contractors did not say they would throw up the contract.” .</p>

Rep. </em>445, it was held that “ a party treating a contract as subsisting, waives the consequences of a previous default, and cannot afterwards avail himself thereof to recover a <em>quantum meruit </em>for work done in pursuance of a contract under seal.” And it may be said in the present, as in that case, that if the company put it in the power of the contractors by reason of any default to dispense with the contract, it was their business either to take advantage of the same by declaring it at an end, or to waive the consequences by treating it as still subsisting. In Lawrence <em>v. </em>Dale, 3 <em>John. Chan. </em>23, it was held that, “ where one party intends to abandon or rescind a contract on the ground of a violation of it by the other, he must do so promptly and decidedly on the first information of such breach. If he negotiates with the party, after the knowledge of the breach, and permits him to proceed in the work, it is a waiver of his right to rescind the contract.” And this principle is fully carried out and maintained by Justice Cowen in Merrill <em>v. </em>Ithaca Railroad Company, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Wend.%20588" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="16 Wend. 588">16 <em>Wend. </em>588</a>; in McCombs <em>v. </em>McKennan, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 216" data-case-ids="1853536" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0216-01">2 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>216</a>, and other cases. The contract is therefore not to be considered as rescinded or abandoned. As, however, the greater part of the line of the road was changed, and the work went on with the assent of both parties, and as there may have been some difference, either increasing or diminishing the difficulties of construction, it may be for the interest of the parties, without doing injustice to either, to allow a recovery in the present form of action, making the sealed agreement the basis of compensation. It will be merely a change of remedy. And this view receives support from the cases just cited. In Merrill <em>v. </em>Ithaca Railroad Company, there was a contract under seal for the construction of certain sections of road, which were not completed at the time agreed upon; but <a id="p92" href="#p92" data-label="92" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*92</a>both parties assented to the work going forward after the day, without any change in the written contract, or a word by the plaintiffs that they intended to alter their rates. <em>Assumpsit </em>was brought by the contractor; and although the court said “ it would he a fraud on the company, were they permitted to change their ground,” yet the action was allowed. It was said, “it would be gross injustice to allow any substantial departure from the stipulations, in reference to which the parties all along acted. It was the business of either to speak out if a change of terms was in contemplation. Silence was equivalent to saying, ‘ I go on upon the old terms.’ ”</p>
