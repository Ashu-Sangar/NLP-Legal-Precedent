On the 8th day of January, 1821, James Ferguson made an assignment on the back of the article between Griffith &amp; Wallace, in these words: “ For value received I sign over my right, title, and interest to the west half of the lot of land mentioned in this article to John Ferguson and Hance Ferguson, for them to hold and receive a deed from Harn J.

John Ferguson built a log house on the fifty acres adjoining the west fifty acres of the two hundred acres, married a wife in 1822 or 1823, cleared some land, but the improvements he made were of an inferior order.</p>

In February, 1830, Day &amp; Meredith brought suit to recover the possession of said land. On the 17th day of April, 1830, the said one hundred and fifty acres of land were sold by Day &amp; Meredith to James Ferguson, 3d, upon years’ time, and the contract of the 10th day of April, 1815, was on the same day surrendered to Day &amp; Meredith, and cancelled — John Ferguson still living on the part he first went into possession of, but paid no purchase-money. In the year 1834 it became necessary that part of the purchase-money should be paid or the land would again fall back to Day &amp; Meredith. On the 9th day of May, 1834, William Sturgeon, father-in-law of John Ferguson, paid Day &amp; Meredith $130 on the fifty acres occupied by John Ferguson, and on the 4th day of November, 1834, William Sturgeon paid the farther sum of $105 on the same. It did not appear under what arrangement Mr. Sturgeon paid those two sums of money. Upon the 7th day of May, 1835, James Ferguson, 3d, in whose name the contract for the land was, and John Ferguson, signed a writing in the words following: “I assign over the west fifty acres on my contract to William Sturgeon, for his use and benefit, by his paying for it.”</p>

Sturgeon permitted Ferguson and his family to live on the land; Ferguson was intemperate and poor; Sturgeon, the father of Ferguson’s wife, was in easy circumstances. Ferguson never paid any part of the purchase-money of the land to any one, nor was he ever bound by any writing or agreement to do so.</p>

The said devisees petitioned the Orphans’ Court of Erie county, to the May Term, 1853, for partition of said land. Inquest awarded, and reported the same could not be divided without spoiling the whole. And upon petition the court ordered the administrator with the will annexed of Margaret Ferguson to make public sale of the land, and the same was regularly sold to James Callen; report of sale made to the Orphans’ Court, and confirmed without objection from John Ferguson, and a deed made by the administrator to Callen. John Ferguson refused to give the possession, and Callen brought this action of ejectment against Ferguson and Dorn, the latter being the tenant of the former.</p>

In May, 1835, he assigned it to his father-in-law, William Sturgeon, for his own use and benefit; and it may be doubted whether it was competent for him to prove that Sturgeon then agreed to hold it for him : 21 <em>State R. </em>263. But we need not decide this. Eerguson never paid anything on the land, and had never signed any contract to pay anything; but Sturgeon paid for the whole of it, and, in August, 1835, got a deed for it in his own name. He permitted Eerguson to remain on the land, and died in 1837, having devised it to his daughter, the defendant’s wife, to have and hold to them and their children’s use during her life, and after her death, to be disposed of to her children as she might think best. Then Eerguson, and his wife and family, continued to reside on the land until her death in 1853. She devised the land to her children; and it was not until it was put up for sale, on proceedings in partition among his children, that he set up any claim to it inconsistent with the title of Sturgeon, and of his own wife and children.</p>

He therefore occupies the position of a plaintiff in a bill in equity, seeking to enforce specific performance. Mr. Brightly, <em>Equity Jur. </em>§ 239, has properly stated the rule that governs such a.claim: “If a party seeking a specific execution, has been guilty of gross laches, or has been inexcusably negligent in performing the contract on his part; or if, in the intermediate period, there has arisen a material change of circumstances, affecting the rights, interests, and obligations of the parties, a court of equity will refuse to decree a specific performance.”</p>
    <p id="b251-6" data-blocks='[["BL_251.6",251,[238,919,1168,171]]]'>This claim is chargeable with all the defects stated in the rule. No doubt William Sturgeon did intend to let Ferguson derive a real benefit from the purchase, and he carried out his intention in his will in a very efficient manner.</p>
    <p id="b251-7" data-blocks='[["BL_251.7",251,[236,1091,1170,422]]]'>But the claim that he made a contract to assign it to Ferguson, is contradicted by near twenty years of conduct inconsistent with the claim. The oral contract, if any, was flatly broken or repudiated by the will of Sturgeon in 1837; and no suit was brought for damages at common law, or for specific performance in the Orphans’ Court, as there ought to have been. He has totally failed in presenting such evidence of a title as equity will listen to; and all that he did’ produce might very well have been withdrawn from the consideration of the jury. Even if there was a contract, the defendant cannot now have execution of it: 25 <em>State R. </em>406.</p>
