On the 9th April, 1850, Findlay obtained a judgment against M. &amp; S. Ayres, for $99.43, before a justice of the peace, on proceedings in attachment. Upon this judgment an execution was issued, and placed in the hands of Hutzell, the plaintiff in this case, who was then a- constable. On the same day Findlay gave to Hutzell a bond of indemnity in the penal sum of $200, conditioned to “ indemnify and save harmless the said Jacob P. Hutzell, &amp;c., for or on account of his seizing and levying upon, removing and selling by direction of the said Hiram Findlay, and by virtue of the said writ of execution, the goods and chattels of any person whatsoever, or any particular goods, to be described as and supposed to be the goods and chattels of the said Moses and Salem Ayres.”</p>

Mr. Findlay agreed in the bond, that if Hutzell would proceed under his direction, and levy and sell the property, supposed to belong to the Ayres, he would save him harmless, and keep him indemnified.</p>

Findlay obtained a judgment against Jacob Koontz and others before Esquire Forney, for $54.50 on the same 9th of April, 1850; same day execution issued to Hutzell. On the 13th April, 1850, this judgment was appealed from, entered on the record of the Common Pleas to April, 1850, No. 56. On the 26th August, 1851, plaintiff took nonsuit.</p>

It is also urged that the amount of the execution against the Ayres was never accounted for by the constable, and that it must be set off here. The plaintiff’s counsel allege that it was paid by the amount of sale-money received, and two horses purchased by Findlay. There is no evidence of any settlement of this execution, and the jury will say whether Findlay received any money and purchased the horses. If so, and the money and horses were equal to the amount of the execution, then you can allow no set-off. If they were of less value, Findlay is entitled to the difference between the amount received and the $99.”</p>

The all-sufficient answer to this defence was, that he had not paid these damages on the bond.</p>
    <p id="b341-7" data-blocks='[["BL_341.9",341,[193,728,1162,300]]]'>That he required the constable to levy on these goods, and that they were the same goods for taking which Koontz recovered against him and the constable, are two facts fixed by the verdict, and on these his liability over to the constable is grounded. What he was required to pay to Koontz in response for the trespass against <em>Mm, </em>was not performance of the condition of the indemnifying bond. That is too clear for argument.</p>
    <p id="b341-8" data-blocks='[["BL_341.10",341,[190,1024,1164,476]]]'>The constable paid $287 of the judgment recovered by Koontz against him and Findlay. To that amount he was damnified by reason of the levies he made. But holding a similar bond of indemnity from Gr. Miller for levying the process of Miller &amp; Dively at the same time on the same goods, he enforced it by action for the whole penalty, which was paid to him by Miller. This left him out of pocket only $82. For that amount he falls back on the indemnity given him by Findlay. It is fortunate for the defendant that the constable is not obliged to claim the penalty <em>of </em>the bond. What he does claim was legally and justly due.</p>
    <p id="b341-9" data-blocks='[["BL_341.11",341,[190,1500,1161,256]]]'>True, he levied the process of Miller &amp; Dively as well as that of the defendant, but acting for both creditors and under indemnity from both, he might resort for compensation to either or both. Having exhausted his remedies against Miller, Findlay has no reason to complain that a sum so much below the penalty of his bond is required of him.</p>
    <p id="b341-10" data-blocks='[["BL_341.12",341,[188,1757,1166,633]]]'>If the constable had been left to act on his official responsibility, he would have had no right to seize so much property on two so small executions; but had he been so left, the probability is he would not have levied on any of these goods as the property of the defendants in the execution. Certain it is that he was ordered and directed by the defendant to make the levy, and the defendant may have thought, and not without reason, that the title of the Ayres was so questionable that the whole of the goods would be needed to produce money enough to satisfy both executions. But it is not for Findlay now to object that the constable made too large a levy, for his authority and recognition are everywhere apparent throughout the transaction. Besides pointing out the property and giving the indemnifying bond, he bought a valuable part of the property at the sale, and was present, consenting to the sale of the whole.</p>
