A <em>scire facias </em>was issued by Mr. Riddle, who -was an attorney at law, to April Term, 1842, under which it was revived, and the amount liquidated at $3214.46. It was again revived to February Term, 1847, and liquidated at $4435.91. Various executions were issued during the years 1848 and 1849, and the real estate of Phipps sold, and the proceeds appropriated to prior liens. The real estate of Phipps had greatly depreciated between the date of the agreement and the sheriff’s sale, by the removal of machinery, and the cutting and destruction of timber upon the land. J. Stuart Riddle, the surviving executor, died in 1850, and letters of administration, with the will annexed, were granted to Arthur McCullum, to whom the defendant paid, at various times, $3376.43 on the agreement.</p>

The executors under the will are mere agents or instruments for a'specific purpose, for converting the estate into money for a contingency for specific purposes only, and an attempt to exchange it for other assets or commodities, was in the nature of a fraud upon plaintiffs, and by being participated in by defendant he has no advantage whatever from it, without at least wiping out the fraud, by paying the consideration-money for the land.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b268-7" data-blocks='[["BL_268.7",268,[254,834,1176,303]]]'>4. In no legal view of this case presented in evidence is the plaintiff’s right of recovery affected by the provisions to secure in payment the judgment against Phipps, but even if they would be otherwise affected by it, the burthen of evidence is upon defendant to show an actual assignment of it, as stipulated for, and ■ clearly show that the avails of it were lost for want of ordinary diligence in enforcing its collection.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b268-8" data-blocks='[["BL_268.8",268,[267,1133,1162,432]]]'>6. The executors were not obliged to bid upon the property at the sheriff’s sale; it was enough if they used such reasonable vigilance as men usually use in like circumstances, and if the money levied at the sale was as much as would have probably been affected at an earlier period, and sufficient as the law then was, and had been from prior to the contract, but its application to the defendant’s judgment was diverted by subsequent legislation, the defendant is not now entitled to charge the estate in this case with the negligence of the executors therein, nor can the plaintiff’s rights be affected thereby.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b269-5" data-blocks='[["BL_269.5",269,[223,416,1159,688]]]'>
      <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>“ 1. We cannot assent to this point; the legal title was in the executors until the purposes of the will should he accomplished; when if the land were not sold, it would, perhaps, have been considered as in the plaintiffs, they having, by joining all the heirs in the action, elected to take the land: M. <em>v. </em>B., <a href="/rawle/2/0185-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Rawle 185" data-case-ids="1820587" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0185-01">2 <em>Rawle </em>185</a>. But the executors having agreed to convey to Clapp, if without fraud the legal title as to that portion of the land of the testator sold was divested by the sale, the sale would be presumed to have been made in pursuance of the power; the descent was broken, the purchase-money, and the right to sue for it, became fixed in the executors, their survivor, and the administrator <em>de bonis non ; </em>and the estate being in the heirs’ of Shippen as to the land sold, an actual conveyance by deed was unnecessary to divest their title. The articles of agreement were sufficient, unless rescinded by the laches of Clapp; and no such decision could be presumed by the jury in this case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b269-6" data-blocks='[["BL_269.6",269,[225,1105,1158,386]]]'>“ As to the second branch of the point: it is not necessary that the defendant in possession should show such an equity as would require a chancellor to decree a conveyance. There might be many cases in which a defendant in possession, under articles of agreement, could maintain his possession without being in a position to compel a conveyance; as when the purchase-money not due, or some precedent act to be performed by the vendor. But it is unnecessary to enlarge upon this point — as explained, we answer in the negative.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b269-7" data-blocks='[["BL_269.7",269,[223,1491,1161,254]]]'>
      <em>“ </em>2. The authority in the will was not contingent. Taking the 2d and 3d clauses, and construing them together, we consider the authority was absolute, to be controlled only by the discretion of the executors. They were to pay the debts and legacies with the proceeds, and the residue was to be equally distributed among the children, share and share alike.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b269-8" data-blocks='[["BL_269.8",269,[225,1748,1161,676]]]'>“ To that part of the point relating to the exchange of the land for other commodities, we do not deem it necessary to express an opinion; but the executors had power to sell for money, or negotiable notes, or judgments, or other choses in action. They had power, undoubtedly, to take, as between them and the purchaser, without fraud on the part of the purchaser, a judgment then supposed to he good, with a guaranty, in payment; and if honestly and prudently done without negligence afterwards, it would doubtless be good against the heirs on settlement of the account of the executors. It could be only alleged against the executors in such a case that they released the lien upon the land, and the same consequence would have issued had they conveyed the title without taking adequate securities, which would have made them liable to the heirs, but the purchaser would have been released from the lien. The last part of the point, and as a whole, is therefore answered in the negative.</p>

      <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>“We have partly answered this in answer to the 2d point; we can perceive no legal fraud in the defendant’s agreeing to pay in a judgment with a guaranty. It was a common business transaction, and doubtless enhanced the price of land. The judgment, had it proved good, bearing interest, would have been a good investment, for the purpose of educating the children when they arrived at the proper ages. We can see nothing in the transaction in the nature of a legal fraud on the plaintiffs, and therefore answer the point in the negative.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b270-6" data-blocks='[["BL_270.6",270,[259,805,1158,431]]]'>“ 4. Had the suit been brought by Riddle, in his lifetime, the assignment and guaranty being in the article of agreement as an original stipulation of payment, would have sustained a plea of payment <em>pro tanto. </em>It would have been otherwise, had the agreement to receive in payment been made subsequent to the original agreement, or collateral to it: 2 <em>Grreenleaf on JEv. </em>823. Under the authority in the will, the same defence can be made in the present case, if in fact the point can arise under the law, as laid down in answer to the other points. The point is however answered in the negative.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b270-7" data-blocks='[["BL_270.7",270,[260,1235,1161,845]]]'>“ 5. Had the action been upon the guaranty, in which light we do not consider it, the executors would have had to have shown the use of due diligence to collect the claim. If Phipps were insolvent, so that pursuit upon his personalty would have been hopeless, the executors were not bound to issue execution. In such ease the burthen of proof would have been on Clapp to have shown that the judgment was lost through the negligence of the executors, in not proceeding as soon as they ought, and the jury could in determining whether by negligence, take into account all the evidence bearing upon it, <em>pro </em>and <em>con, </em>whether there was unreasonable delay in the proceeding, and if there was a decrease in the value of the property either by gradual or sudden causes, through the debts of the owner, or acts of Providence, or even — as put in the point — owing to the acts of the legislature. But the act of 1848, we instruct you, did not change the law. Before that time creditors, who had their judgments properly entered on the judgment-docket, would have been entitled to a preference ; and the defendant lost nothing in this respect by the delay, unless the change of an incorrect decision, which would be no grounds in his favour.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b270-8" data-blocks='[["BL_270.8",270,[267,2089,1156,301]]]'>“ If all the property that David Phipps had were sold on another judgment, and for a price inadequate to pay the judgment, it was unnecessary for Mr. Riddle to proceed on the Clapp judgment while the sale was pending in court, and before it was set aside, so that in the mean time he could not have been charged with negligence. . With these remarks, the point is decided in the negative.</p>

This point is new, and at first we were disposed to decide otherwise; no authorities occur to us, as we cannot agree to the conclusion of the point. We have, on consideration, concluded to answer the whole of it in the negative.</p>

Riddle, after surviving Barlow, having done acts in affirmance of the contract and the administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>afterwards having received payments on the foot of it, nothing hut actual fraud on the part of Clapp could avoid the deed, and we will not say, even if the case were as stated in the point; there was fraud on the part of Clapp. The consent of Barlow might be presumed, but still it would be a question of fact for the jury.
