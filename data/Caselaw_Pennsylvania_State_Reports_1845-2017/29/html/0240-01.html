Three <em>fi. fas. </em>were issued against them, upon which their personal property was sold. The sale extended through several days, and was finally completed October 11, in the forenoon. The proceeds of the sale overpaid the three <em>fi. fas. </em>about $90, which surplus money was in the sheriff’s hands. The <em>fi. fas. </em>already mentioned, as well as those hereinafter mentioned, were returnable to the first Monday in November, 1856. On the afternoon of the 11th October, <em>fi. fa. </em>in favour of William Boyd was put in the sheriff’s hands, upon which he levied upon the surplus moneys in his hands, and upon a small amount of personal property not before levied on. On the 13th October, the <em>fi. fa. </em>of R. G. Herron, the appellant, was put in the sheriff’s hands, upon which he made the same levy as upon Boyd’s writ. On the 14th October Duggan &amp; Berry placed in the sheriff’s hands <em>fi. fa. </em>in their favour, upon which levy was made upon the small amount of personal property before referred to, but not upon the surplus money.</p>

In such a contest the policy of the law is to appropriate the debtor’s assets to the payment of his debts, unless he brings himself within one of the exceptions provided by statute. The exemption laws preserve from execution a certain amount of property supposed to be necessary for the comfortable existence of the debtor and his family; but the surplus money levied on in this case is not within the letter or spirit of these laws. The Act of 16th June, 1836, expressly authorizes the seizure of coin, or bank notes in payment of debts, <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>except where such money is raised by execution <em>at the suit of the </em>debtor, or is in his <em>personal possession.</em>

    <p id="b242-7" data-blocks='[["BL_242.7",242,[276,624,1154,771]]]'>But it seems that Richard G. Herron obtained a judgment before a justice, issued an execution thereon, which was returned u no goods,” and filed a transcript in the Common Pleas, by virtue of which he issued a <em>fi.fa., </em>and levied on the money in question. After the transcript was filed in the Common Pleas, but within the twenty days allowed for an appeal, R. O’Brien &amp; Co., the debtors, entered bail for an appeal from the judgment of the justice of the peace; but they never filed the appeal in the Common Pleas. By the terms of the Act of Assembly, the appeal is “ effectual” if the transcript be “filed in the prothonotary’s office on or before the first day of the next term of the Common Pleas, after entering such bail as aforesaid.” As between debtor and creditor, the failure to enter the transcript within the period prescribed by law rendered the appeal entirely ineffectual. It is not necessary to express an opinion on the effect of entering bail for an appeal in giving one creditor a preference over another. It is sufficient to say that the debtor himself can gain no advantage, either by his own fraud or his own negligence.</p>

The decree of the Court of Common Pleas of the county of Erie is reversed, and it is further decreed that the money in court be distributed according to the report of the auditor. It is further decreed that the costs be paid by Richard O’Brien and P. Grace, doing business under the name of R. O’Brien &amp; Co.</p>
