The plaintiff resides in the city of Baltimore, and while the tobacco was in transit to the plaintiff, Bagaley, Woodward &amp; Co., on the 4th of September, 1852, issued a foreign attachment against Hiett, by virtue of which the defendant below seized 32 hogsheads of this same tobacco. Oh the 28th of April <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>judgment was entered by default against Hiett, it being the third term. On the 7th of May, 1853, this suit was brought for the seizure. On the iOth of January, 1854, the counsel for the parties agreed, as the property was deteriorating, that a <em>fieri facias </em>should issue, upon the judgment against • Hiett, and that the tobacco should be sold, and the proceeds be paid into court to abide the issue of the controversy. And such agreement was not in any measure to affect the rights or vary the position of any of the parties. The sale was accordingly made, and Schumacher, the plaintiff, became the purchaser through his agent, for $1061.01. The net proceeds after deducting freight, charges, &amp;c., $570.45.</p>

      <em>“ </em>The question on the former trial was in relation to the title or property, and this question being carried to the Supreme Court, has been there determined in favour of Frederick Schumacher, the plaintiff.

Now the measure of damages is the injury sustained by the plaintiff in consequence of this seizure. Had the tobacco not been attached, it would have been carried without delay to Baltimore. What then would have been its value in the Baltimore market in September, 1852 ? for that value the plaintiff might have realized, had he received it as it was consigned to him, and as he was entitled to receive it. The evidence given to the jury on the former trial has been admitted by agreement on this, and it will enable you to judge of the value of such tobacco in Baltimore at that time; and thus may you ascertain the loss occasioned by the attachment of this property and its detention from the plaintiff. The position contended for on behalf of the defendant, that the amount of money in court produced by the sale of the tobacco under the agreement of counsel should be the measure of damages, is not tenable. The plaintiff’s rights were in no wise compromitted by that sale, <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>which was made with a reservation saving the rights of the parties and was for the general benefit, as the tobacco was constantly deteriorating by being kept in package. It was especially beneficial to the defendants, since the longer it was kept, the less its value, and the greater their loss in the contingency which has occurred of the same being decided to belong to Frederick Schumacher.</p>

The misconduct of Mr. Wharton, his own book-keeper, in destroying his cash accounts and in cutting out Schumacher’s account after the settlement, may, perhaps, be sufficient to induce Hiett to “believe” and to entertain the “ opinion” that there was “something not right in Mr. Schumacher’s accountbut it is not competent evidence to impeach the settlement. The discovery by the witness of “papers” which “satisfy”' him “that the accounts shown by Schumacher and Wharton were false,” may be sufficient to justify him in instituting proceedings in Ohio for the recovery of what he alleges to be due to him from Schumacher. But as he does not condescend to produce the “papers” referred to, orto give us a statement of their contents, they furnish no foundation for the decision of the court and jury in this cause. The opinion of the witness, founded on papers not described or produced, was not competent evidence.</p>

As it was on its transit to Baltimore, and the trespass of the defendant below prevented Schumacher from receiving the value at that market, the just measure of damages is the value in Baltimore, less the charges of the carriers for delivering it there. These were the rights of Schumacher when the agreement for the sale of the property was <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>made. But as it was provided in that agreement that it was <em>“ </em>not in any measure to affect the rights or vary the position of any of the parties,” Schumacher’s rights remain as before. The effect of the sale was nothing more than a conversion of the property into money. This was for the benefit of the creditors of Hiett, who had seized it. Schumacher had as good a right to purchase at the sheriff’s sale as any other person. He paid his money and took the risk of loss, like a stranger to the transaction. He is therefore justly entitled to all the advantages of his bargain. He was under no obligation to advance his money to prevent a sacrifice of the property, or to take the tobacco to Baltimore to make a profitable sale of it for the benefit of a trespasser who had deprived him of it.</p>

This is not assigned for error. But justice requires us to notice it. If the plaintiff below consents to remit the amount (which appears to be $350.85), the judgment is to be affirmed. If not, it must be reversed and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.</p>
