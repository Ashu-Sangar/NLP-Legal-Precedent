Blood, to recover possession of 900 acres of land, surveyed upon warrant No. 2370, and situate in Heath township, Jefferson county. The title appeared to have been regularly vested in Wilhelm Willink &amp; Co. In 1830 it was assessed with taxes in the name of Willink &amp; Co., and, as is alleged, sold for their non-payment by William A. Sloan, treasurer of Jefferson county, to one George W. Pelton. No deed is shown from Sloan to Pelton, but to prove its existence, plaintiff offered the minutes kept by the prothonotary, of acknowledgment in 1833, of William A. Sloan to said Pelton for No. 2370; they also offered the testimony of Pelton to prove its loss. By deed bearing date 25th January, 1837, Pelton seems to have conveyed his interest in the land to Edward Jackson, who, on the 19th of March, 1838, conveyed the one undivided half part of the tract to William Hoyt; William Hoyt and wife, by deed dated 14th September, 1841, conveyed their interest (reserving 115 acres) to Robert and William Halsey. It was alleged that William Halsey and wife, on the 1st of May, 1852, conveyed their interest to Robert Halsey. It was also alleged that the half of the tract which remained in Jackson was conveyed by him to Robert Halsey, by deed dated 20th October, 1854; this deed does not appear to have been acknowledged until about the 23d of October, 1855. The land was assessed with taxes in the name of Wilhelm Willink, in Barnett township, for 1848, and in 1849, 1850,1851^ in Heath township. It was sold for the non-payment of these taxes by E. R. Brady, treasurer of Jefferson county, to Cyrus Blood. The deed to Blood was dated 'the 1st, and acknowledged the 17th of September, 1852. Cyrus Blood sold his interest to C. P. Cummins and K. L. Blood, by deed dated 17th February, 1854, and C. P. Cummins and wife by deed dated the 8th December, 1854, conveyed their interest to Kennedy L. Blood, the present defendant. <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>It is alleged that the effect of Brady’s sale was destroyed by the redemption of the land by plaintiff, on the 25th January, 1854. This is denied by defendant, who avers that the so called redemption was no more than a deposit of money with the treasurer for the purpose of purchasing the title of K. L. Blood. That at the time of alleged redemption, plaintiff, by J. J. Y. Thompson, who he now says was his agent, left an assignment with the treasurer, with directions to pay the money to Blood only on the event of his executing the assignment.</p>

The defendant relied upon a sale for taxes. The plaintiff answered that by the production of the treasurer’s receipt for the redemption-money within two years from the sale. The defendant below then offered to prove by parol evidence that when the money was left with the treasurer, several days before the receipt was given, the plaintiff’s agent left it on condition that the money should not be paid to the defendant, unless he would execute an assignment of his title; that this condition was made known to the defendant, when he <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>went to the treasurer for his money, and that he has always refused to accept the money on the conditions stated. It would be a sufficient answer to say that the money was left with the treasurer subject to the conditions named on the 21st January, 1854, and the treasurer gave and the plaintiff’s agent accepted an <em>unconditional </em>receipt for it four days afterwards, to wit, on the 25th January, 1854. But waiving this answer, it is certainly sufficient to say that the law imposes on the treasurer the duty of receiving and receipting for the redemption-money for the use of the purchasers at the treasurer’s sales. He has no right to accept it upon conditions of any sort. The moment he receives it he is bound to pay it over to the purchaser on demand, regardless of conditions attempted to be imposed by the party redeeming. The receipt given for the money by the treasurer to the original owners, is the written evidence of redemption prescribed by law. It is an official document which cannot be destroyed by such parol evidence as was offered in this case.</p>

Such a defence must be founded on a perfectly legal title, and must be made out with sufficient certainty to enable the court and jury to enforce it. A wrongdoer, without title, who endeavours to protect his trespass by the outstanding title of a stranger, has no equity, and is not entitled to any particular favour. In this case the defendant has nothing to do with the 115 acres. He neither describes them, nor locates them, nor shows that he is in possession of that particular part of the tract. It is therefore impossible to set it out to him in the verdict. It was his business to make out his defence with certainty. In this he has entirely failed.</p>
