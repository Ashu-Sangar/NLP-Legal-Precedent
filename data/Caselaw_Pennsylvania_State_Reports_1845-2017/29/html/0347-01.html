Breading against John Blocher, to recover the value of a crop of grain belonging to the plaintiff. Blocher, the defendant in this action, brought an ejectment to December Term, 1848, against the tenants of Breading, and on the 21st of April, 1854, a verdict was rendered in his favour in that action for the premises therein described, and being the same on which the grain in dispute was raised. On the 18th July, 1854, a writ of <em>hdbere facias possessionem </em>was issued, and the plaintiff Blocher put into possession. A writ of error to the judgment was taken, and on the 21st October, 1854, the record was returned with a certificate that the judgment had been reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded. On the 13th January, 1855, the court below entered a rule to show cause why a writ of restitution should not be awarded, and on the 5th March following this rule was made absolute, and the writ was issued, and under it the premises restored to Breading. On the 5th June, 1855, this action of ejectment was again tried, and a verdict and judgment therein rendered in favour of the defendant, and which, on writ of error, was affirmed by the Supreme Court.</p>

      <em>“ </em>But could this action be maintained until it was determined in the ejectment, who was entitled ultimately to the possession? We think not: the right of action depended upon the right to the possession, at least it would involve circuity of action, and might produce contradictory verdicts and judgments. Suppose this action had been tried first, and decided for plaintiff, and after the ejectment had resulted against the present plaintiff, in action for the mesne profits, the judgment obtained for plaintiff in this action must be recovered back again in order to make the plaintiff in the action for mesne profits whole. Such contradictions and mcongruities could only be avoided by waiting until the rights of the parties were ascertained; that being settled, the only question would be one of amount.

It establishes beyond further question the right of the plaintiff in error to be restored to all things which he has lost by reason of the erroneous judgment. Its justice cannot be rejudged in any collateral proceeding. Its execution cannot be delayed to abide the final result of the suit in which it is rendered. Its object is to restore the parties immediately to the condition they were in when the suit was commenced. If a plaintiff in ejectment, by means of an erroneous judgment, turns the defendant out of possession, he is bound to restore the possession the moment the erroneous judgment is reversed. An entry under judgment is attended by very different consequences from an entry by act of the party without judgment.</p>
    <p id="b349-8" data-blocks='[["BL_349.10",349,[234,1232,1166,988]]]'>In the latter case it is a disseisin, which, if peaceable, gives the party a possession which cannot be taken from him, except upon a trial at law. In the former case, as the law never works injury to any one, the moment the erroneous judgment is reversed the possession acquired under it falls with the judgment, and the party entitled to restitution is not necessarily driven to his action to regain his possession. He may enter without action, because, the law regards the possession as his, and the occupancy of the other party as a mere intrusion. But an entry may not restore him to the crops which the other party took and carried away while his possession was sustained by the erroneous judgment. For these he is entitled to some remedy, either by action on the case or by judgment of restitution. No objection was made in the court below on the ground that the latter course was not taken, and it is not necessary to give any opinion on that point. The only objection stated by the judge is that the plaintiff could not recover while the other party remained in possession, and while the ejectment remained undetermined; and this, as we have seen, is no bar to the action. It is true that the ejectment has since been decided in favour of the present plaintiff. But this is not material. He had a clear right when his suit was brought to recover for his crop of corn which the defendant carried off, and nothing has been shown which defeats that right.</p>
