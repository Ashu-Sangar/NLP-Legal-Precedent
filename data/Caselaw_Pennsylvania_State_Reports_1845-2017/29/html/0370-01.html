Nor does it appear that any tax whatever has ever been assessed upon or demanded of the company. Nor that any dispute has ever arisen between the parties in regard to the same.

As a corporation it does not stand before our law, and for all purposes as the identical company that existed under the same name by the law of Ohio. So far as it has existence as a railroad company in our state, it is a company incorporated by our law, and subject to the same taxes as other like companies, and on plain principles of justice it ought to be so regarded.
