    <p class="summary" id="b18-9" data-blocks='[["BL_18.9",18,[306,1074,1163,898]]]'>At January sessions, 1853, a petition was presented for <em>the </em>appointment of viewers to vacate and supply a' certain part of a road in Lower Windsor township. The viewers were appointed, and afterwards made a report in accordance with the prayer of the petition. Exceptions were filed to this report, and on the 31st day of January, 1864, it was set aside, other viewers appointed, and an <em>alias </em>view directed. These viewers made report, vacating the portion of the road mentioned in the petition, and supplying it by a new route, which report was filed and confirmed <em>nisi, </em>and the width directed, <em>on the </em>27th April, 1854. At the August sessions a petition was presented for a review, and reviewers appointed, who made a report vacating only a part of the old road, and supplied the portion thus vacated by a new and different route from that reported by the <em>alias </em>viewers. This report was confirmed <em>nisi, </em>and width directed on the 4th January, 1855. At the following April sessions re-reviewers were appointed, who afterwards made a report vacating the same portion of the old road vacated by the viewers, and supplying the same by a new route different from both those of the viewers and reviewers. This report was filed on the 25th August, 1855, confirmed <em>nisi,' </em>and the width fixed by the court.</p>

On the day the viewers met, Daniel Keller, the plaintiff in error in this proceeding, appeared and objected to Bahn being sworn, alleging his incompetency, on the ground of his relationship with Emig. Emig was present, and advised that the objection should be disregarded, and the view proceed. Bahn was sworn with the other re-reviewers, and a report was made in accordance with the views of Emig, and those acting with him for the road. Daniel Keller filed exceptions to the report, the only one of which that was pressed in the <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>court below, or in this court, related to the competency of Bahn on account of his relationship to Emig to serve as a viewer.</p>

And the depositions taken while the exceptions were pending in the court below showed that Emig lived at a distance from the road, in a different township, but owned a farm lying a short distance from where this road was located, and that it furnished a better road to and from his farm to the railroad and turnpike than the old road did. That he attended before the viewers, and urged the change to be made, and that he and David Bahn, the viewer, were married to half-sisters.</p>

We see plainly enough that Emig took a good deal of interest in the road; but he was not one of the petitioners in any part of the proceeding, and we do not see that he had any such legal interest as would have rendered him incompetent to be himself a viewer in this sort of a public transaction, in which all citizens are more or less interested, for public roads are for the use of all; and in which so large a control is given to the court. It is impossible to be as nice about these questions of challenge for cause, in ro,ad cases, as we are in regular jury trials; for we have not the facilities for doing so, and it would often cause vexatious and unprofitable delays to attempt it. Yery much must be left, in such cases, to the discretion of the sessions. We are not able to say. that, in this instance, they have exercised this discretion erroneously.</p>
