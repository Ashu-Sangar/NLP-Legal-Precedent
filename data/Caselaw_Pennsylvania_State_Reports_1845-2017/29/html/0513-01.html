John Bradford left no issue.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b514-6" data-blocks='[["BL_514.6",514,[313,595,1167,1845]],["BL_515.1",515,[204,428,1162,2021]],["BL_516.1",516,[286,414,1161,722]]]'>At the time of his death, John Bradford owned a farm of 187 acres of land in Franklin township, worth about $1631.61, as per appraisement list. Out of the personal property the widow retained $300 under the exemption law. The administratrix in her account filed charges herself with all the personal property contained in the appraisement list, except the amount retained by her, as already stated. The appraisers appraised all the personal property showed them by the widow, except the property mentioned in exception second, which she claimed as her own separate property, to wit: a bay mare, worth $95 or $100; a bay colt, $40; three cows, $30; and three head of young cattle, $15. The exceptant alleges that this was not the separate property of the wife, but belonged to her husband, and that she ought to be charged with it. There is no evidence that Mrs. Bradford had any money or property at the time she was married, except some bedding, and some few articles of household furniture. Her father lived in the neighbourhood, and was in good circumstances. But there is no evidence that she ever received anything from him or any other source after her marriage in her own right. Mrs. Bradford appears to have had a good deal of energy, and to have taken considerable interest in, as well as control over, the business of her husband; sold marketing, loaned money, made bargains. She bought the mare and two of the cows in dispute, and paid the money for them. John Bradford told different persons that his wife had money, and on one occasion, when a neighbour wanted to borrow money from him, he said he had none, but that his wife had money, and to go to her, and he thought he might get it from her. Mrs. Bradford bought the mare when a colt; the bay colt was out of this mare; she bought one of the cows from John Green, and another from H. O., but it does not appear how she came by the third; the young cattle were the calves of these cows, and were raised on the farm. John Bradford, when speaking of these horses and cattle, always said they were his wife’s, except on one occasion mentioned by Valentine Bowser, when Mrs. Bradford wanted the mare to ride to town, Mr. Bradford wanted the mare to plough, and refused to let his wife have her; and said “ he would let her know the mare belonged to him; that she claimed the mare; but when it came to the pinch, he owned her.” It does not appear that John Bradford ever made a formal gift of any of his property to his wife, or ever said he had done so; or that it was ever set apart by him for the sole use and benefit of his wife. It was kept on the farm with his other stock. The colts and young cattle were raised there, and remained there till <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>his death. If she had any right to it, it must be by purchase, and not by gift. Mrs. Bradford has not shown where she got the money to make the purchase; she has not shown that she received the means to make the purchase from any source independent of her husband. If she made' the money by her personal industry, or by selling marketing taken from her husband’s farm, it would not be hers, but his; and if with money raised in this way she purchased the horses and cattle in dispute, they would also be his. “ He is entitled to the person and labour of the wife, and the benefit of her industry and economy. Savings out of the family purse, furnished and replenished by the husband, are not property that accrues to the wife within the meaning of the act:" Raybold <em>v. </em>Raybold, 8 <em>Harris </em>311. Bradford might have permitted his wife to retain her personal savings, and apply them to her own use as her separate property, but there is no evidence that he ever did so, or that he ever released any of his marital rights to them. “ To bring the property of a married woman under the protection of the Act of 11th April, 1848, it is made necessary by the letter as well as the spirit of the statute to prove that she owns it; she must identify it as property which was hers before marriage, or show how she came by it afterwards. Evidence that she purchased it amounts to nothing, unless it be accompanied by clear and full proof that she paid for it with her own separate funds. In the absence of such proof, the presumption is a violent one that the husband furnished the means of payment: Keeney <em>v. </em>Good, 9 <em>Harris </em>355. When personal property is thus claimed by a married woman, she must prove her title by evidence which does not admit of a reasonable doubt; unless rigid proof of her title is always required, no one can calculate the amount of injustice which the Act of 1848 will produce: Gamber <em>v. </em>Gamber, 6 <em>Harris </em>366. In this ease the accountant has failed to give evidence that she owned any portion of the property before marriage, or any satisfactory evidence that it was purchased afterwards with her own private funds; and if thé estate was insolvent, this would be a decisive answer to her claim. But the accountant contends that as the estate is solvent, the rule laid down in the cases cited does not apply; and that the declarations of her husband as proved, that this was her property, is sufficient evidence of her ownership as against his heirs, and every other person; as that is sufficient, without this property, to discharge all liabilities against the estate. This might be true if he had stated how she acquired-it, or that he had given it to her, to have and hold of her own right, or that she had purchased it with her own separate money, and not with the money from the sale of his property, or in any way independent of him. But this he never said. All he said might be true, and yet not inconsistent with his ultimate claim of ownership. There is nothing more common than for a husband to say that such and <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>such things belong to his wife, as her horse and saddle, her cow, or that his wife has money, without dreaming that he is thereby investing her with a separate ownership of the property, and he would not be so understood by others, unless he further explained how she acquired it. When the estate is solvent, the declaration of the husband as to the ownership claimed by the wife, might be competent evidence on the part of the wife to prove her right to it, but they must be full, clear, and unequivocal, and show satisfactorily how she came by it, or that he admitted it to be her own separate property. But your auditor is of the opinion that the evidence does not go that far. She has not been able to show that the property was given to her, nor how nor where she got the money with which she purchased a portion of it. The presumption of law therefore arises that it came from the family purse, or was realized from the sale of her husband’s property. She should therefore be charged with the amount of it in her account as administratrix of said deceased.</p>
