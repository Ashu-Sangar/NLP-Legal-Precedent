White, as surety on the official bond of Cyrus Elliott, a constable. Two executions were issued on the 19th day of September, 1851, by William Lock, Esquire, in favor of Gr. Kirkpatrick, against Reuben Sharp, and placed in the hands of the constable, and which he failed to return within the time limited by the Act of Assembly. The plaintiff in the executions died, and his executor was substituted, who took a transcript of the proceeding before Esquire Lock, and proceeded against Elliott, the constable. On the 28th July, 1853, the justice rendered judgment against the constable for the sum of $75.48 ; execution issued on the 10th October, 1853, which on the following day was returned <em>nulla bona.</em>

If the insolvency appears, it is for the surety to gather what he can from the wreck, after paying the creditor according to contract.</p>
    <p id="b178-7" data-blocks='[["BL_178.7",178,[291,972,1160,335]]]'>Due diligence does not require of the creditor to be wiser than the officers of the law appointed to enforce his right; or to know that his claim may avail to seize property that is exempt from seizure for debts generally. It does not require him to accompany the collecting officer and show him personal property, unless he has some special knowledge relating to it; nor to indemnify the officer on making a doubtful levy, nor to suspect him of a false return.</p>
    <p id="b178-8" data-blocks='[["BL_178.8",178,[291,1316,1157,173]]]'>The duty of reasonable diligence is discharged by the due issue of the proper process to the proper officer, and then trusting him to do his duty faithfully.

If the plaintiff used the ordinary legal measures of collection and failed, he is not chargeable with the officer’s ignorance of the true interpretation of the exemption laws,, and therefore not for fruitless return, when there might have been an effectual one.</p>

The duty of the plaintiff was to show that collection from the principal was impracticable. This might have been done by showing that the appropriate legal remedies had been duly applied and failed; and this mode of proof could not be answered by evidence of solvency. Evidence of diligence is answered only by evidence of negligence or by contradiction.</p>

He decided, moreover, that a constable is not entitled to the benefit of the exemption laws, on an execution against him for neglect of his official duty; and in this he was right, and for it has assigned very adequate reasons.</p>
    <p id="b179-6" data-blocks='[["BL_179.6",179,[232,684,1160,507]]]'>If this principle was applied to rebut the plaintiff’s oral evidence of insolvency, by showing that the constable had property subject to his claim, it was rightly-applied. If it was applied in answer to the plaintiff’s evidence of diligence in the use of legal remedies, it was error, being a departure from the evidence to be answered; but we think such was not the judge’s intention, for he says that the plaintiff is not to be affected by the false return of the writ against the constable. And so the plaintiff must have understood it, for he has no exception to the application of the principle, but only to the principle itself. The principle excepted to having been rightly decided, and there being no exception to evidence, we cannot reverse.</p>
