Mock had been in the livery business in the city of Reading, but in December, 1854, he sold out his stock for the sum of $2300, and applied the same to the payment of a part of his creditors. Mock still owed a considerable sum, was without property, and had a wife and eight children. George Good<a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>man, the father of Catharine Mock, was also the owner of a small livery establishment in Reading, and on the 25th January, 1855, he sold it to Mrs. Mock for the sum of $1600. She gave her notes for this sum, $50 payable on the 1st April, 1855, and $200 annually thereafter, except the last payment in 1868, which was for $150. After making the purchase she rented a stable, and had the livery business carried on in her own name. Adam Mock and the children attended to the stable, taking care of the horses and vehicles, but the management and control of the business appeared to be under the direction of the wife.</p>

Notice was given of Mrs. Mock’s claim, but the sheriff being indemnified by the plaintiff in the execution, sold the property for $571. This action of trespass was then brought.</p>

But it ought to be very clearly and satisfactorily proved to the jury that she did so conduct the business. It would not be tolerated for a moment, that a woman should formally buy property in her own name, and put her husband in to conduct business in her name, as her agent, she immediately to pay for the property out of the profits of the business. It would be considered as the husband’s property, and would be liable for his debts. And it would be the same whether she undertook to pay for the property out of the profits or not, if, as in this case, she had no property of her own. Mrs. Mock, it does not appear, had any property of her own, other than what she bought of her father, and could therefore only have looked to the profits of the business carried on with that property for the means of payment. Now, if her husband made the profit, what was paid was his money; for the law could not allow such an arrangement between husband and wife to defeat the creditors of the husband. The wife would have had nothing in the property, as she paid nothing for it; and as what was paid subsequently would have been paid by the husband, the property would have been his.</p>

It was quite competent for her father to sell on long credit, or to give her his stock of horses and carriages, whereby she might carry on the business to which her <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>husband and children were accustomed; and by such means to provide a support for them. It was for such purposes that the Act of 1848 qualified married women to hold separate property; and the act does not require her use and possession of the property to be exclusive of her husband: Hoar <em>v. </em>Axe, 10 <em>Harris </em>384. Such a construction would, in many instances, defeat the beneficent objects of the enactment, or else rupture the nuptial relation. The ruling in Gamber <em>v. </em>Gamber, 6 <em>Harris </em>365, is relied- on by counsel for reversing this judgment; but it would be misapplying the doctrine of that case to give it any such effect. The husband there was the purchaser of the property in question, and it was his mere declaration of his wife’s interest which was set up to defeat his creditors; but here we have full and express proof, verified by the verdict, that the wife was the separate and exclusive purchaser. The ground on which this case rests is distinctly recognised and approved in Gamber <em>v. </em>Gamber; and regard being had to the difference in the facts of the two cases, that is an authority in favour of, rather than against, the instruo • tions of the learned judge in this case.</p>
