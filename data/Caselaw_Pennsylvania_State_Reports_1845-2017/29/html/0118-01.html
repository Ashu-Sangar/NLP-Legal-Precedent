    <p class="summary" id="b118-12" data-blocks='[["BL_118.11",118,[262,1583,1168,818]]]'>This was an action of ejectment brought by William A. Petriken and Margaret his wife, and Hugh Montgomery, against Robert Montgomery, Peter Sheddy, and Moses Covert, to recover 696 acres of land in Clinton township. The land in dispute formerly belonged to John Montgomery, who died in 1836, having devised the land in dispute one-third to his son Robert in fee, one-third to his son James likewise in fee, and the remaining one-third to his son William, and “ at the death of said William his share to be equally divided between Robert and James, with this provision, in case the said William should ever recover from the present malady under which he now labours, then he is to hold all the property devised to him for his own benefit and disposal.” William at the death of his father was insane, and died in 1839, having never recovered from that malady. During his lifetime, on the 23d of May, 1837, Robert and James made an amicable partition of the land between themselves, and each took possession of their respective purparts. Robert erected valuable improvements on his part of the premises, with the knowledge of the plaintiffs, and had the quiet possession of it up to the time of the trial.</p>

Jordan, P. J., after stating the facts, delivered the following opinion:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b119-9" data-blocks='[["BL_119.9",119,[240,1016,1164,551]]]'>“ The intention of the testator is to govern in all cases, where that intention can be gathered from the will. There can be but little doubt as to the testator’s intention in this case. He wished his son William to have the estate devised to him during his natural life, and his two sons Robert and James to enjoy it after William’s death. But, in the testator’s mind, there was a possibility that the malady under which William was then labouring might be removed, and in that event it was the testator’s desire that this afflicted son should have the same estate in the portion devised to him, as Robert and James were to have in the portions devised to them. An event, however, occurred, not anticipated by the testator — the death of his son James in the lifetime of William.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b119-10" data-blocks='[["BL_119.10",119,[240,1575,1163,474]]]'>“What was the estate James and Robert had in the land devised to William ? The defendants contend they had a vested remainder, which might be transferred by them,'aliened, and enlarged, much in the same manner as an estate in possession. If this is a vested remainder in James and Robert, this position would be correct <em>(Cruise’s Dig. </em>2 vol. page 263, § 8); and having the power to alien, there does not appear to be any good reason why they might not make an amicable partition. A person entitled to a vested remainder, has an immediate fixed right of future enjoyment, an estate <em>in presentí, </em>that is only to take effect in possession and permanency of profits at a future period: same book, § 9.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b119-11" data-blocks='[["BL_119.11",119,[242,2042,1160,347]],["BL_120.1",120,[262,412,1168,729]]]'>“ A vested remainder, or a remainder executed, is one by which a present interest passes to the remainder-man, to be enjoyed in future, and by which the estate is invariably fixed to remain to a determinate person, after the particular estate is spent. Thus, as if A. be tenant for years, remainder to B. in fee; B.’s remainder is vested, which nothing can defeat or set aside. Apply this definition, which we find in all the elementary treatises on the subject, to the case in hand. The restoration of William to health, or <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>recovery from the malady under which he was labouring, would have at once defeated the remainder to James and Robert. The particular estate, by which the remainder is supported, is a conditional life estate, which upon the happening of the condition would be enlarged into a fee simple estate. In Waddel <em>v. </em>Rattew, 5 <em>JR. </em>281, the devise was in these words, ‘ I give, devise, and bequeath to my son Aaron the messuage, plantation, and tract of land where my son John now lives in Middleton township, containing about 119 acres, more or less with the appurtenances, to hold to him my said son Aaron during the term of his natural life, and if he shall hereafter have issue of his body begotten, then to hold to him, his heirs and assigns for ever; but in case he shall die without leaving such issue, then I give and devise the same to all the rest of my children, their heirs and assigns, as tenants in common for ever.’ A. suffered a common recovery, and had issue who died during his life. It was held by the Supreme Court that the ulterior limitation was a contingent remainder.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b120-6" data-blocks='[["BL_120.6",120,[256,1142,1165,555]]]'>“ The event upon which Robert and James were to enjoy the land in fee was a dubious and uncertain event — the non-recovery of William from his affliction. The particular estate, by which the remainder over was supported, might chance to be determined, and thus the remainder over never take effect. The Court being of opinion that the estate devised to James and Robert, in the land devised to William, was not a vested remainder or a remainder executed, the partition agreement and possession taken in the lifetime of William was of no validity, and could not confer on the parties to it a title that can prevail over the title of plaintiffs. Direct judgment to be entered on the special verdict in favour of the plaintiffs for the undivided 22-75th parts 'of the land in dispute.”</p>

Their fee is vested subject to be defeated if ever the event contemplated should happen. The estate to arise in case William should become sane, was by way of a conditional limitation on the fee previously granted, as may be fully seen in <em>Smith on Ex. Inte</em>
