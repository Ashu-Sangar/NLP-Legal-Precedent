The rights and liabilities of the parties would of course be controlled by any express agreement between them, but where there is none — where it is a simple payment and receipt of a check, supposed by both parties to be good, the debt is not satisfied until the check is paid. The holder assumes the duty of presenting the check and demanding payment within a reasonable time, and if he neglects to do so, and the banker fails after the time it ought to have been presented, the loss is to be borne by the holder, not by reason of the receipt of the check, but of his negligence which has occasioned the loss. He may not charge against his debtor the consequences of his own neglect, and this on the same principle of natural justice which forbids the debtor to take advantage of <em>his </em>wrong in issuing a worthless check to a <em>bona fide </em>creditor. These principles are of every day’s application among business men; 'but the case before us questions them, and compels us to look into the authorities to see if they have not the obligatory force of law.</p>

Checks resemble bills of exchange rather than bank notes: <em>Chitty on Bills </em>17; 7 <em>T. R. </em>430; 3 <em>Johnson’s C. </em>5; and fall within that class of securities which Chief Justice Gibson in this very case of Bayard and Shunk so broadly distinguished from the common currency of the country. Like bills of exchange, they are open letters of request for the payment of money to a particular person or his order or to bearer. They are drawn against a supposed deposit. They are not payment, but an order on the depositary to make payment for the drawer. When payable to bearer they pass by mere delivery, like bank notes, but so do promissory notes and bills of exchange. The grand distinction between all these securities and bank notes is that by the conventional rules of business they do not enter at all into the currency of -the country, a very large part of which is made up of bank notes. These are lent by the banks as cash, they are paid away as cash, and the language of Lord Manseield, in Miller <em>v. </em>Race, 1 <em>Burr. </em>452, was not too strong when he said, <em>“ </em>they are not goods, nor securities, nor documents for debts; but are treated as money, as cash, in <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>the ordinary course and transaction of business by the general consent of mankind, which gives them the credit and currency of money to all intents and purposes; they are as much money as guineas themselves are, or any other coin that is used in common payments as money or cash.” It was on the ground of this distinction that Bayard <em>v. </em>Shunk was ruled. The parties dealt in the common currency of the country, each of whom had the same opportunity to know its character, and both of whom were ignorant of its worthlessness, and therefore they were held to what they had done. But that case, so far from being pressed into the service of the defendants, is an authority against them. “ If the securities,” says the Chief Justice, in speaking of bills and notes— among which, I submit, it is giving checks all the dignity that is their due to rank them — “ <em>if the securities are transferred for a debt contracted at the time, the presumption is they are received in satisfaction of it; but if for a precedent debt, it is that they are received as collateral security for it, </em>and in either case it may be rebutted by direct or circumstantial evidence.” This was not, strictly speaking, an <em>obiter dictum, </em>for it was necessary to the bringing out, in bold relief, the distinction on which the case was ruled, but it is entitled, for a better reason, to be considered an authority; because it expresses the very mind of the law, as I now proce'ed to show.</p>

C. C.

As the wheat was delivered the two purchasing firms divided it between them; but instead of paying in bank notes, each firm gave the creditor bills on Baltimore for their respective shares of the wheat. The bills of Tyson &amp; Co. were paid, but those of Byrne &amp; Co. were protested, and this was an action against Tyson &amp; Co. on the original contract to recover for the wheat had by Byrne &amp; Co. The plaintiffs recovered, and in affirming the judgment Chief Justice Gibson said: — “In relation to the partnership, each of the partner firms may be treated as a stranger capable of dealing with it in the character of debtor or creditor; and as by the contract of sale, the wheat was to be paid for in the notes of particular banks, the subsequent acceptance of bills drawn by the partner firms, <em>was payment in the bills of a stranger of a precedent debt. </em>On no other hypothesis could there be the shadow of a defence; for as one simple contract will not merge in another, it has invariably been held that the debtor’s own bill or note for the price of goods sold will not extinguish the original liability: <em>Ld. Raymond </em>1430 ; 2 <em>Strange </em>1218 ; <em>Willes </em>406. It merely operates as an extension of credit, a,nd prevents a recurrence to the original contract of sale before the bill or note has come to maturity: 1 <em>Esp. </em>3.

    <p id="b455-6" data-blocks='[["BL_455.6",455,[215,799,1165,1205]]]'>Such is the voice of authority in regard to the character of checks as an instrument of payment. Distinctions are not taken between payments in the debtor’s checks or those of a third person, because no ground exists in reason for such a distinction. When this plaintiff applied to the defendants for $200 of what they owed him, and they gave him their own check for $132.94, and that of E. Fronefield &amp; Brother for $67.06, had they paid him one of these sums any more than the other ? If their own check had not been paid, it is admitted he would have recourse to them — their check was not then, <em>per se, </em>payment. But they were well known to him, and he had confidence in them, as is shown, by leaving his money in their hands. It does not appear that he knew Fronefield &amp; Brother, or had any reason to confide in them. Did he, indeed, take their check as higher security than that of his chosen debtors ? Are we to hold that the check of the defendants was not payment, but that of Fronefield &amp; Brother was ? On what principle ? No words were spoken, or agreement made to create a difference. Both were mere cheeks — of exactly the same grade and quality in law. If we are to make implications from the circumstances of the parties, the reasonable presumption would be, that the plaintiff received the check of the defendants with more faith and confidence — with stronger assurance that it would be paid, than the check of a party unknown to him. It is more reasonable to infer that he meant to be their insurer, rather than the insurer of the other drawers. If a distinction were to be made at all between these instruments of payment, it ought to be in favour of the one which is admitted not to have been payment, and against the one that is claimed to have been payment.</p>
    <p id="b455-7" data-blocks='[["BL_455.7",455,[216,2004,1166,427]],["BL_456.1",456,[274,417,1158,86]]]'>But there is no ground for such a distinction. None surely in reason, as applied to this transaction — none in authority, as I have abundantly shown. The plaintiff received both checks on the same footing — as payment, if or when paid. With proper diligence, without the slightest imputed negligence, one of them proved uncollectable. And now, on a question of payment between debtor and creditor, that check can no more be considered payment than if it had been drawn on the same bankers by the defendants themselves. They are not liable, as drawers or endorsers, for they kept their name off of it, but they are liable on the <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>original debt; for to the extent of this worthless paper, issued by them, it remains unpaid.</p>
    <p id="b456-6" data-blocks='[["BL_456.6",456,[273,503,1162,601]]]'>There is no principle in our jurisprudence better settled or more benign than that, as between the original parties to a contract, equity will relieve against a failure of consideration. If the defendants had not had full value from the plaintiff, they would have claimed relief. The most solemn contracts, even bonds and mortgages, do not exclude inquiry into the consideration. How is this acceptance of two checks to be elevated so high -as to be above inquiry and relief ? Is it indeed so, that the law will relieve against failure of consideration in all contracts, except only when a creditor receives from his debtor a check of a third party ? A rule so absurd and so unprincipled could have no other effect than to impair that confidence which is the very life of commercial transactions, and to compel debtors to make their payments in the constitutional currency.</p>
    <p id="b456-7" data-blocks='[["BL_456.7",456,[272,1103,1163,559]]]'>But it is said the case stated makes the checks payment, and that we must take the fact as if found in a special verdict. In the narrative of the transaction, the case stated speaks of the checks being paid to the plaintiff, but there is not a word in it which implies that he acknowledged them as satisfaction of his debt, or even gave a receipt for them, or qualified the mere tradition of them by any express or peculiar terms. Had there been anything of this sort — a receipt in full, if you please — the authorities cited show it would have been only conditional payment; and other numerous authorities, which it were a shame to array in an opinion, prove that all manner of receipts, even those upon deeds of conveyance, are open to explanation, and may be proved not to have been actual and <em>Iona fide </em>payments.</p>
    <p id="b456-8" data-blocks='[["BL_456.8",456,[271,1662,1161,299]]]'>But of receipt, acknowledgment, or agreement there was none —the mere acceptance of the checks was the only payment the special verdict finds. Payment — hut payment in checks. This is what the case stated makes it. And this not by way of barter, but payment in checks of a pre-existent debt, and this was conditional payment — payment when the checks were paid, or else the law means not what it says.</p>
