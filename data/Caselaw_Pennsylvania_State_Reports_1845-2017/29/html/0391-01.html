This was not in conformity with the Acts of Assembly. Petitioners are entitled to damages for the ground occupied by or appropriated to the street, viz: <em>For </em>the amount of their land taken in opening a street;, but not for . damages to which they may be subjected in having to cut away and grade the land to be occupied by a street.</p>

The plan of specification to be deposited in the regulator’s office, is not required to exhibit the grade of the street, but only its location, limits, and width. If the reference to the general road law were to be considered as embracing anything more than the proceedings for damages, that would not imply a necessity for prefixing the grade, for although <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>the 3d section of the Act of 13th June, 1836, <em>Purdon </em>718, enjoins that whenever practicable viewers shall lay out roads at an elevation not exceeding five degrees, they are not required to make any return or record on the subject.</p>

It is perfectly apparent that the two subjects of opening and grading streets, kept studiously separate in the legislation I have referred to, are blended and jumbled together in these proceedings. On the face of the petition, the deep cuttings of said street is made a prominent subject for the claim of damages. The length of the time taken by the viewers, the large compensation charged for their services, and the enormous damages awarded, all indicate clearly that it was not merely the opening of Ridge street which they took into consideration, but the deep cuttings which they assumed were contemplated, and the effect these would have on the properties of the owners complaining. This, indeed, was not only the <em>gravamen </em>of the complaint, but of the assessment of damages, and yet for such a proceeding in respect to such a subject-matter, there is not a syllable of legal authority shown or alleged.</p>

Nor did they acquire jurisdiction over the latter subject by linking it to the former. In no form or manner is the grading of streets committed to the courts.</p>

What was said by Judge Sergeant, in the Newville Road Case, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20177" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Watts 177">8 <em>Watts </em>177</a>, about the right of an owner to have damages not only for occupying his land with a public road, but for lessening the value of the remainder, had reference to a complaint of the <em>shape </em>in which the residue of the- petitioner’s land was left, and not to digging and grading, or any other matter that was governed by municipal regulations. In O’Conner <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh, 6 <em>Harris </em>189, it was held that the cutting down of a street consequent on the reduction of the grade, and ruining an owner’s building, was not the subject of legal compensation in any form. This, it must be admitted, is very harsh law, and operates with great injustice in the cities óf Pittsburgh and Allegheny, where the topography is such as to make frequent cuttings necessary to obtain streets of tolerable grades, but it is the result of legislation sought for and obtained by the people themselves. It is impossible for us to relieve individual cases of hardship, for we are set to administer the law as we find it, rather than to mould it as it should be.</p>
