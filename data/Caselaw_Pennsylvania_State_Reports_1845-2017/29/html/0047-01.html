The real estate left by the intestate, under a writ of partition and valuation in the Orphans’ Court, was appraised in seven purparts, in 1838. Three of these purparts, valued at $12,740.60, were taken by Jacob H. Forney, and he entered into recognisances to secure to the widow the interest of one-third "the valuation during life, and to the other heirs their .equal portions of the valuation, with interest. Two of the purparts, not accepted by any of the heirs, were sold by Jacob H. Forney and Lydia Forney, the widow of the intestate, as administrators, under an order of the court. Their final account was confirmed at August Term, 1840, and in which there was a balance of $6175.48J- due the estate in their hands, including two-thirds of .the purchase-money of the land sold.

As their wards <em>became </em>of age, the guardians paid their shares of the real and personal estate in full, and took their releases. On the 22d March, 1842, they paid to John R. Forney, one of their wards, then arrived at age, $1847.27. 18th October, 1848, to Sarah H. Forney, $2549.52. 21st October, 1848, to Magdalena, $2549.52. 9th July, 1851, to Lydia H. Forney, $3029.16.

Forney, under which the real estate, bound by the recognisance, was levied on and sold by the sheriff. The proceeds were brought into court for distribution, and Jacob Forney, Sr., and George Fox, the guardians, claimed to be subrogated upon the recognisances, and take out of the proceeds the shares of John R., Sarah, Magdalena, and Lydia, who had been paid by them. This was resisted by the judgment-creditors of Jacob IP. Forney, and the court referred the matter to an auditor, who reported the facts, and that in his opinion the guardians were not entitled to subrogation. Satisfaction had been entered on the recognisance for two shares. The commissioner awarded to Rebecca and Leah each their shares of the recognisance, with interest, a balance of interest due to the widow, and the residue to the judgment-creditors of Jacob H. Forney. Forney and Fox, the guardians, filed exceptions to this report, and the court sustained their exceptions, and ordered them to be subrogated upon the recognisances. From this decree Isaac Ely, Lydia Forney, and Joseph E. Peter, judgment-creditors of Jacob H. Forney, and also Jacob H. Forney, severally appealed.</p>
