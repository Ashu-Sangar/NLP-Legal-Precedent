    <p class="summary" id="b232-8" data-blocks='[["BL_232.8",232,[268,830,1167,129]]]'>This was a feigned issue to try the validity of the will of John Rinehart, deceased, dated September 1st, 1854, in which issue the plaintiffs in error were defendants below.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b232-9" data-blocks='[["BL_232.9",232,[267,959,1166,513]]]'>The will was written by Mr. Lucas by the testator’s direction. He examined it carefully, and it being satisfactory Mr. Lucas wrote his (testator’s) name to it, and testator attempted to make his mark to it, but being badly affected with the palsy was unable to do so without assistance, and Mr. Lucas steadied his hand while he made his mark. Mr. Lucas in his testimony says “ the testator could not have held the pen to write his name.” It did not appear affirmatively that testator expressly requested Mr. Lucas to steady his hand, but after it was executed he requested Mr. Lucas “ to take it and keep it locked up,” which he did. The will was witnessed by Lewis Jennings and John D. Whitaker. Defendants below, on the trial, presented the following points :—</p>

    <p id="AIB" data-blocks='[["BL_233.9",233,[245,632,1169,903]]]'>The Act of 8th April, 1833, says: “ Every will shall be in writing, and, unless the person making the same shall be prevented by the extremity of his last sickness, shall be signed by him at the end thereof, or by some person in his presence, or by his express direction; and in all cases shall be proved by the oaths or affirmations of two or more competent witnesses, otherwise such will shall be of no effect.” There can, we think, be no mistaking the provisions of this law. Drawn with singular clearness and precision, it would certainly seem to cover every conceivable case. If prevented by the extremity of last sickness from signing or requesting some one else to do so, the will is valid, all other things being regular. But where there is ability, the testator must sign himself, or expressly request some one else to do so. In either event the act must be his own. If another signs for him it must be at his own order. The law neither contemplates nor allows a joint execution, or a signing by proxy without express authority. It must be the testator’s own voluntary, unaided act — otherwise the signing cannot be by him. Aside from the fraud which would inevitably result from such a departure from the plain requirement of the Act of Assembly, as is now proposed, where would be the certainty of the rule ?</p>
    <p id="b233-8" data-blocks='[["BL_233.10",233,[241,1536,1168,556]]]'>There being no pretence that the testator expressly requested Mr. Lucas to assist him in making his mark, this will can only be sustained then on the ground that he made the cross or mark himself — a position utterly preposterous, for the testator was virtually as incapable of such an act as a dead man, as is fully shown by all the testimony. The Act of Assembly therefore providing expressly for such a case, there can be no room for an execution by implication or presumption. But we think there is abundant authority for a rigid adherence to the letter as well as the spirit of the Act of Assembly: Stevens and Wife <em>v. </em>Vancleve, 4 <em>W. C. C.
