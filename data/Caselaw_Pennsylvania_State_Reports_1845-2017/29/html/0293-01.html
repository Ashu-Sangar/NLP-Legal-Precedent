C. Walker, and on that day paid Galbraith &amp; Graham $144.93, and gave a new note, payable to the plaintiffs, for $418.11, being the balance due on the original claim. Walker paid Galbraith &amp; Graham, September 12, 1843, $317 on the note, and paid John Galbraith, Esq., on the 27th day of March, 1848, $138.14, the balance of the note. The defendants, by letter, dated June 14, 1843, informed the plaintiffs that they had adjusted the claim against Mr. Walker, by <em>talcing other </em>securities, <em>nothing said about any money having been paid by Mr. Walker to them. </em>On the 27th February, 1847, Galbraith wrote the plaintiffs, “For the claim against Walker a number of small notes, &amp;c., were transferred as collateral, to <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>what amount, or how much has been collected on them, I have not been able as yet to ascertain with precision, but have the way all clear now, so that I can ascertain, and will do so as soon as possible, and inform you, and have that closed up, Mr. Walker is now here, came yesterday, and, in a day or two, with his assistance, can ascertain how the matter stands, and shall go at it.” On the 9th of July, 1847, Galbraith again wrote to the plaintiffs that he had not seen Walker, that Graham was absent, consequently was unable to give the desired information in relation to the Walker claim. July 25, 1847, Galbraith issued a writ of foreign attachment, McCoon &amp; Sherman <em>v. </em>S. C. Walker, upon a note dated 26th May, 1843, for $418.11, and attached property of Walker, which suit was not prosecuted to judgment.</p>

Within six years before (27th February, 1847), Galbraith had written to the plaintiffs, expressing his ignorance of the state of the case, informing them that collaterals had been placed in the defendant’s hands, but not saying that any payment had been made to them, and promising to ascertain and inform <em>them </em>farther. In July he wrote again that he was still without information, and promising to obtain and communicate it. Long before that his partner had collected the most of the claim, and Galbraith is in law chargeable with a knowledge of this, and therefore he must be treated as not revealing it when called upon, but promising to do so, and not until then, at least, could the statute of limitations begin to run. We are not very sure that Graham is a party appearing to this suit; but however this may be, the letters of Galbraith are evidence against his late firm, if he had power to act for both in settling up the business, and the statute had not already run when they were written. He seems to have thought that he had such power. Besides this, the balance of the claim collected and paid over by Galbraith, in 1848, shows that the matter in which he and his partner were employed, was not terminated until then; for the dissolution of their partnership did not dissolve their relation to their client. The plaintiffs could look to them both for the duty confided to them both. For partial collections made and communicated to their clients, perhaps the statute would run from the time of the notice. But without this, the statute would not run until the case was terminated by complete success or failure, or until the termination of the relation of attorney and client in the given case: <a href="/watts/4/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Watts 334" data-case-ids="1842747" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0334-01">4 <em>Watts </em>334</a>.</p>
