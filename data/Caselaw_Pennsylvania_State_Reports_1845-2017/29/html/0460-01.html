Crocker, accompanied by Ralph Kellogg, a son of the defendant, went to the plaintiffs’ store in Erie. Ralph Kellogg had previously purchased a stock of goods of plaintiffs, of which he had sold some part. On their way to Erie Ralph Kellogg and Crocker made an agreement, by which Kellogg sold out the remainder of his stock to Crocker, amounting to $203.90, Crocker agreeing to become responsible to Stockton &amp; Fuller for that amount. When they arrived at the store of the plaintiffs, Crocker presented the letter from the defendant, and stated the agreement between himself and Ralph Kellogg. Plaintiffs assented to the arrangement, and charged the trunk and goods to Crocker, and sold Kellogg a new stock. Crocker also purchased goods on the same day, as charged to him on the books of plaintiffs, amounting to $26.22, and the same date he is credited . with .one plated watch, $13.25, returned. No farther purchases were made at that time. January 4, 1853, Crocker is charged with sundry items amounting to $44.78. No part of the goods taken at any time, were charged to Erastus Kellogg. The goods were all charged to Crocker.

On the 29th October, 1858, plaintiffs sued Crocker for the same goods, and recovered a judgment for $255.73.</p>

It seems the witness, R. C. Kellogg, had before that time obtained a small stock from the plaintiffs, and had a portion of them still on hand. If he returned them to the plaintiffs, with the understanding that they should be delivered to Crocker as the ‘ suitable stock’ to be delivered to Crocker on the credit of the order of Erastus Kellogg, and it was so understood by the parties at the time, it was the same thing as the delivery of any other stock to Crocker. If, however, the plaintiffs allowed R. C. Kellogg to get the new stock on his responsibility, and delivered the goods to him, they cannot charge the defendant with them on this writing. The law of the case may be stated in answer to the defendant’s points.</p>

We think it is more in the character of an order sent by Crocker to deliver to him the goods on his account, particularly if taken in connexion with the testimony of Conkling, if believed by the jury, as to the arrangement between the defendant and plaintiff prior to the date of the order. The second point is therefore decided in the negative.</p>

If the purchase on the 21st was the' entire purchase intended at that time under the order, the defendant would not be liable under it for any subsequent purchases; and if that were so, the defendant would be entitled to have the payments applied to the first purchase, as stated in the fifth point; but if the delivery was of part only contemplated under the order on the first day, and of the balance but a few days afterwards, and so constituting in reality all one purchase, it would determine both these points in the negative.</p>

In all cases where a plaintiff seeks to make one man liable for the debt of another, the case must be plainly made out. Every apabiguity in the evidence weighs in favour of the defendant: Unangst <em>v. </em>Hibler, 2 <em>Casey </em>153. It is essential in such a case, that the plaintiff should accept and give credit on the faith of the proposition ; and it is equally necessary that the guarantor should be notified that his proffer has been accepted, otherwise there is no contract. A mere offer, not accepted, is not a contract; and a mere mental acceptance of a proposition, not communicated to the party to be charged, is not an acceptance at all in the eye of the law. It is important to the interests of the business community that every one should know the extent of his liabilities, in order that he may take the proper measures to meet them, and to secure <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>himself, in cases where he has bound himself for others: Kay <em>v. </em>Allen, 9 <em>Barr </em>320; Unangst <em>v. </em>Hibler, 2 <em>Casey </em>153. In this case there was no evidence that Erastus Kellogg had been notified of the acceptance of his guaranty. The plaintiff below was therefore not entitled to recover, and the court ought to have instructed the jury accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b464-6" data-blocks='[["BL_464.6",464,[270,668,1160,512]]]'>It has been said that notice of acceptance is not necessary where the agreement to accept the guaranty is extemporaneous with it: Wildes <em>v. </em>Savage, 1 <em>Story’s R. </em>26. This has been thought to be an exception to the rule, and it is supposed that the present case is within the exception. Rut my impression is that it was not intended to recognise any exception to the rule. It merely affirms that when the guarantor is present, and the agreement to accept is made the moment he offers it, this is notice, and surely neither law nor common sense requires more: 9 <em>Barr 820. </em>In the case under consideration, Kellogg was not present when his offer was accepted, and he had no notice of it whatever. There was, therefore, no contract with him.</p>
    <p id="b464-7" data-blocks='[["BL_464.7",464,[271,1182,1158,683]]]'>This disposes of the case; and it was not necessary for the court below to give any opinion on the other points made. Rut as the cause goes back, and the evidence may assume a new aspect, it may be proper to say that the charge against Erastus Kellogg for the goods which Ralph C. Kellogg had sold to Crocker, cannot be sustained by the evidence stated on the paper-book. The remains of stock in the hands of young Kellogg were not the “suitable stock” within the meaning of the guarantor. The sale by young Kellogg shows that the son of the defendant and Crocker had made an entirely new arrangement by which Mr. Cracker was to travel alone, whereas the contemplation of the guarantor was that Crocker was to travel with the guarantor’s son. The goods thus sold to Crocker were not sold to him by Stockton &amp; Fuller at all. They had sold them to Ralph C. Kellogg; and if Erastus Kellogg is to be made liable for them it must be by means of other evidence than the letter of credit given to Crocker.</p>
