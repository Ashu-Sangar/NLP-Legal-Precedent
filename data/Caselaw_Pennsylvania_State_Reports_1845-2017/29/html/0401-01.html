Stockton were partners, doing business in the city of Pittsburgh, under the style of Johnston &amp; Stockton. They purchased, January 12, 1835, from the Bank of the United States, “to hold as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants,” certain real estate on Second and Third streets, in the First Ward of the city of Pittsburgh. They subsequently became embarrassed, and a large number of judgments were obtained against them jointly, and against R. C. Stockton alone. The property above named was levied upon, at the suit of William Addison, for use, and April 25, 1854, sold to George S. Selden, Esq., for $12,500. Of this money, $4991.64 were paid into court for distribution among the lien-creditors; and May 13, 1854, Reade Washington, Esq., was appointed auditor to make such distribution. This he was not able to do on account of ill health; and March 15, 1856, Augustus Washington, Esq., was appointed auditor “ to complete the distribution of the money in court.”</p>

He divided the fund for distribution into two equal parts, and appropriated R. C. Stockton’s half thereof to those judgments against him “ which, as liens, are prior to any of those against Stockton and S. R. Johnston jointly.” After exhausting Stockton’s portion of the money, the judgments against Johnston &amp; Stockton jointly were paid in their order out of the portion of the fund belonging to S. R. Johnston.</p>

This-. <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>judgment was the first in priority of lien to be paid out of S. R. Johnston’s half of the fund. The principal and interest thereof amounted to $1452.04. The manner in which the auditor distributed this portion of the fund in court, was the main subject of exception to his report, and the decision of the District Court thereupon is the cause of the appeal to this court.</p>

C. Stockton, through Schoonmaker &amp; Co., to C. O. Loomis, was applicable to the judgment in dispute, it does not follow that Stockton, either for himself or as trustee for Mrs. Stockton, the wife of one of the defendants in the judgment, acquired any title to the judgment, except as a purchaser from the plaintiffs’ attorney. William C. Stockton was a mere volun<a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>teer, and the money paid by him was only intended to transfer the ownership of the judgment, and not to work its satisfaction. It was a purchase and not a payment. An attorney at law as such has no power to sell his client’s judgment, and his attempted sale will only bind the client when the act is ratified, or adopted by the receipt of the money or otherwise. The judgment of Thomas, Cowperthwait &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Johnston &amp; Stockton, was entered on the 14th January, 1852, for §1277.77. The payment made by C. O. Loomis, their attorney, on the 2d June, 1852, including commissions, amounted to §998.20. To this extent the sale by Loomis was good, but it is very clear that the remainder of the money applicable to this judgment belongs to Thomas, Cowperthwait &amp; Co., and to no one else. But how stands the case between the two purchasers, Wm. C. Stockton and Edward Campbell, Jr.? Stockton’s purchase was first made, but of this Campbell had neither actual nor constructive notice. No assignment was ever made to Stockton, and we are unable to discover any evidence of facts brought home to Campbell sufficient to put him upon inquiry. Before purchasing he inquired of the surviving partner whether the judgment had been paid by the defendants, and was answered in- the negative. In buying from the attorney he took the risk of payment by the attorney to the client; but as to other persons whose interest did not appear of record, and of which he had no notice, he stands in the same position as though he had purchased directly from the plaintiffs in the judgment; and that a subsequent purchase of a judgment accompanied or followed by a transfer upon record will pass title against a prior purchase not docketed, and of which the second purchaser was ignorant, is conclusively settled in this state: 1 <em>Harris </em>620; 10 <em>Harris </em>300 ; 1 <em>Casey </em>80. Our opinion then is, that Campbell’s assignment is good against every one except the plaintiffs in the judgment and as they do not deny his right, it follows that he is entitled to be paid the amount appropriated to him by the auditor.</p>

C. Stockton the money applicable to the judgment of Thomas, Cowperthwait &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Johnston and Stockton, No. 338, January Term, 1852, is reversed, and the auditor’s report is now confirmed, and distribution decreed according to said report.</p>
