There is nothing in its terms expressly limiting and restricting its application to roads thereafter to be laid out. The duty which it imposes is founded on the clearest principles of equity and justice, and there is the same reason for requiring its performance in the one case as in the other.

Such seems to have been the opinion of the commissioners who reported the Act of 1836, for, in their remarks upon the various provisions, they do not intimate that they have made any change in the law in this respect. Whether the Act of 1802 is susceptible of such a construction or not is a question not necessary to be determined in this case, as [the Act of 1836 makes it the duty of all persons, their heirs and assigns, for whose use a private road is laid out and opened, to fence the same. The defendant, then, as the owner and occupant of ‘the Keen Farm,’ is bound to fence the road through the plaintiff’s land, so long as he continues to use the same in connection with his occupancy of the said farm.] The duty of fencing the said road arises out of his use of the said road in connection with his ownership and occupancy of ‘the Keen Farm,’ and not from the use of the said road, in connection with his ownership and occupancy of a portion of the Harger tract.</p>

Another ground of defence set up to this action, is that the defendant is not now, nor was he at the institution of the action, the sole owner of ‘ the Keen Farm,’ but that parts of it are owned <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>by Jacob Bradwell, Thomas Steele, and John Silk. The evidence shows that the defendant, some years after his purchase, sold thirty-two acres to Jacob Bradwell, one acre to John Silk, and the eighth of an acre to William Silk, now owned by Thomas Steele, in connection with other land. We may set aside, as irrelevant to the question, the acre and an eighth sold to the Silks, as the evidence shows that these pieces have no connection with the road. The evidence shows that Bradwell occasionally uses the road. Is the fact that Bradwell so uses the road in connection with his occupancy of his portion of ‘ the Keen Farm,’ sufficient to defeat this action, and prevent the plaintiff from recovering from the defendant ? It may be true, as contended by defendant’s counsel, that Bradwell is bound to contribute to the expense of fencing the road, and keeping the fence in repair. But the court decline to charge that there can be no recovery against the defendant in this action, because Bradwell may be ■also bound to bear a portion of the expense of fencing the said road. The law imposes upon the defendant, as ow7ner and occupant of ‘the Keen Farm’ (excepting the part sold), the duty of fencing, or contributing to the expense of fencing the road through plaintiff’s land, so long as he continues to use and travel the same; and this court has jurisdiction to enforce the performance of this duty, and to compel the payment of such damages as the plaintiff may have sustained, in consequence of the defendant’s neglect and refusal to perform his duty in this behalf. Under the Act of 1836, the defendant is bound to contribute his proportion to the expense of fencing the road over plaintiff’s land, and for his failure in this respect, the plaintiff may maintain this action, and recover such damages as he may have sustained thereby. If the jury find that the defendant agreed to keep up the fence along the road if it was on plaintiff’s land, as he now admits it to be, then he is liable for such damages as the plaintiff may have sustained by his failure to fulfil his promise.</p>

As owner of the land over which the road is laid out, he has a right to use it in any way that will not prejudice or obstruct the defendant’s right of way.

If it could be demonstrated that the provision of the Road Law of 13th June 1836, which requires him who enjoys a private road through a neighbour’s land, to fence it, was not intended to apply to a private road, laid out like this one under the Act of 6th April 1802, and further, that the reasonable construction of the Act of 1802 would devolve no duty of fencing on the holder of the private road, we would not hesitate to declare it to be his duty, according to the common law of Pennsylvania. Indeed, we apprehend the Act of 1836 was only declaratory of what has generally been the cústom among farmers, that he who causes a private road to be laid through his neighbour’s land, shall do all necessary fencing. Strictly speaking, it becomes a private road only by fencing, for only so is it separated from adjacent fields. If the cost of fencing has been assessed as damages, either under the Act of 1802 or that of 1836, let it be shown, and it would be a defence to an action like this; but it was not shown in this ease, and we cannot presume it, for the legal presumption would be, that fencing was to be done by him for whom the private road exists, and therefore not accounted for as damages.</p>
