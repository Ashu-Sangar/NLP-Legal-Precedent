      <em>“ </em>The defendant endorsed and transferred the note either before or after the payment of the McKenzie note. If before, then he was guilty of no fraud, although he may be ultimately responsible to the maker in case the latter is compelled to pay the note. If after his endorsement and transfer of the note, it may have been fraudulent. But against whom was the fraud committed ? Certainly not against the .plaintiff, for he has got all he bargained for, viz., the right to demand and receive payment of the note from the maker. He did not receive the note from the defendant, nor pay him any consideration therefor — his rights as against the maker were not prejudiced by anything done or omitted by the defendant. Even the qualified endorsement, the only act done by the defendant affecting the rights of the plaintiff, was not sufficient to put him on inquiry as to the consideration of the note, and to open the door for a defence by the maker. If, then, the defendant defrauded any one by the endorsement and transfer of the note, it was the maker. Admitting, what the evidence by no means shows, that the defendant was 'guilty of a fraud on the maker by the endorsement and transfer of the note, he would doubtless be liable to the maker for the injury done him thereby. But what right has the plaintiff to complain of a fraud which can possibly do him no harm ? The maker himself could not maintain an action against the defendant without first paying the note, and if he could, the plaintiff is not his representative, nor is he clothed with or entitled to be subrogated to his rights. If, then, the plaintiff has not been defrauded by the defendant; if his rights have not been impaired; if he has all he bargained for when he purchased the note, what possible ground has he upon wffiich to stand in order to maintain an action ? If the note had been forged, the case would be different, but as it is, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.</p>
