    <p class="summary" id="b63-12" data-blocks='[["BL_63.12",63,[195,1888,1164,215]]]'>“ You perceive that this action is brought by one claiming under a treasurer’s sale against a party in whom is vested the title of the former owner.

It is well settled that where unseated lands are sold for taxes for a sum exceeding the amounts of taxes and costs due, a surplus bond for the residue is indispensable to <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>the validity of the title, and unless such bond be given the sale is void, and the deed confers no title in the treasurer’s vendee. In this case it seems there was an excess to be provided for, and no surplus bond is produced, and no direct evidence that such bond was ever given. This is alleged by the defendant to be a fatal and incurable defect in plaintiff’s tax title. In reply to this allegation the plaintiff contends, first, that he is protected from such objection by the limitation contained in the Act of 1804, which is in these words : ‘ No action for the recovery of said land shall lie unless the same be brought within five years from the sale thereof for taxes as aforesaid.’ And, secondly, that the law will presume a surplus bond to have been given, and the burden of proof is therefore cast upon the defendant to show that such bond was not given. The argument of the plaintiff’s counsel is, that after twenty-one years the law presumes that the treasurer’s sale, and all proceedings incident thereto, were regular, and in accordance with the requirements of the law, and that upon this presumption he may securely rest until it is attacked by proof tending to show the contrary.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b64-6" data-blocks='[["BL_64.6",64,[276,1187,1166,1203]],["BL_65.1",65,[166,385,1167,1200]]]'>“ As to the first branch of this reply. It is held by the Supreme Court that the limitation contained in the Act of 1804, already referred to, is in full force and unrepealed, and if it applies to the case in hand, then, according to the ruling in Iddings <em>v. </em>Cairns, <em><a href="/grant/2/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Grant 88" data-case-ids="227555" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0088-01">2 </a></em><a href="/grant/2/0088-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Grant 88" data-case-ids="227555" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0088-01">Grant 88</a>, the limitation will perfect the title of the purchaser even in cases where no surplus bond has been given. This leads us to consider whether the plaintiff’s case falls within the true meaning and intention of the limitation. It will be observed that this ejectment <em>is </em>brought <em>by the </em>owner of the tax title <em>against </em>one who claims under the former owner, and that there is no evidence that the purchaser or those claiming under him ever went into possession of the land, but on the contrary it is proven that the father of one of the defendants used the premises in dispute as woodland in connection with his farm for several years previous to his death; and moreover, this action admits the defendants in actual possession when the writ issued. These facts I regard as important. In Parish <em>v. </em>Stevens, 3 S. &amp; R. 296, the Supreme Court held that the five years began to run from the date of the sale, notwithstanding no possession was taken by the purchaser; but in Wain <em>v. </em>Shear-man, 8 S. &amp; R. 357, that doctrine was reconsidered, and it was held that the five years are to be computed from the time the purchaser enters into possession. This last case was decided in 1822. On the 29th of March 1824, an act was passed providing a mode whereby an action of ejectment could be brought against a purchaser at tax sale, although no person be in possession under the tax title. This act has beep held to restore the law as it was held m Parish <em>v. </em>Stevens, and accordingly in all sales <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>since the passage of the Act of 1824, the limitation commences to run at the time of sale. In this instance the sale occurred in 1818, and the five years had already expired when the act was passed. But it is suggested that the owner, by the 3d section, had two years wherein to bring his suit after the passage ,of the act. It is not quite clear to my mind that in this case the owner would be required to bring suit within two years, but whether he would or not, I regard it an important inquiry here, because, as this court construes the law, the limitation applies only to suits brought <em>against </em>the <em>purchaser </em>at tax sale, and not to suits brought <em>by him, or those claiming under him, </em>against a person in possession of the land. This is in accordance with the view taken by Judge Huston, in Bigler <em>v. </em>Cams, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20139" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 139">3 W. &amp; S. 139</a>, and he adds, by way of suggestion, that it is worth' considering whether the Act of 24th March 1824 is not, in the most favourable construction, intended as a shield to the purchaser against the former owner, and not as a sword to wound him 'or. any other claimant. Although it is held that the title of the former owner cannot, after the limitation has closed, be set up as an outstanding title by a party in possession to defeat an action.brought by the purchaser at tax sale, yet no case, that I can find, goes so far as to determine that the limitation is conclusive in an action brought by the purchaser.against the former owner in possession; and if I understand the ruling in Bigler <em>v. </em>Cams, it is there held that the act does not apply to such a case. I am therefore, led to the conclusion that the defendant is not precluded by the limitation from alleging any defect in the sale which will'invalidate the title of the purchaser.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b65-6" data-blocks='[["BL_65.6",65,[160,1586,1173,731]]]'>“ This brings us to consider whether the sale is void for want of proof that a surplus bond was given. The plaintiff contends that he is not bound to show affirmatively that a bond was given, but that on the contrary it lies upon the defendant to make out by proof this allegation. [We cannot assent to the broad proposition that the purchaser is not required to show the existence of a surplus bond. He is bound to prove .it either by direct proof of .its having been given, or by such evidence as will raise a legal presumption of the fact. In this case more than thirty years were suffered to elapse between the sale and the bringing-of the suit, and during that period the purchaser-' and those-claiming under him continued to pay the taxes assessed on the' land!

Surely this tends to show that it was not this land that was sold, or that there was some fatal defect in the plaintiff’s title, and the failure to give the surplus bond would he such a defect. Both parties paid the taxes ever since, neither, we suppose, knowing of the double taxation. But this is some evidence that the defendants did not know of an outstanding title, and is of some value in a case where the county records fail to show any sale for taxes.
