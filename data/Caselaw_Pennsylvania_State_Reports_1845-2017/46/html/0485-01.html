      <em>Anderson v. </em>Dawson, 15 Ves. Jr. 532, wras the case of a settlement by a <em>feme sole, </em>in contemplation of marriage, of part of her fortune, in trust to pay the dividends to herself for her separate use for life, and after her death, for her intended husband, and after the death of the survivor, to transfer the capital to her appointment by will, and in case she should die without appointment, and he should be then dead, in trust for her next-of kin, their executors and administrators, according to the Statute of Distributions. She became a widow, and filed a bill .praying that the trustees may be decreed to transfer the stock to her on the ground that she was absolutely entitled» to it, discharged of the trusts of the settlement. Sir William Grant dismissed the bill, holding that the widow had only a life estate, with a power of disposition by will. He said (p. 536), “ This bill can be supported only upon the assumption that the. plaintiff has the absolute property in the fund, and is not merely entitled for life with a power of disposition by will. In order to make that out, it must be shown that the ultimate limitation to her next of kin is either wholly inoperative or is in effect a limitation to herself ; but there is a great difference between a limitation to the executors and administrators and a limitation to the next of kin. The former is as to personal property, the same , as a limitation to the right heirs as to real estate, but a limitation to the next of kin is like a limitation to heirs of a particular description, which would not give the ancestor, having a particular estate, the whole property in the land. The meaning of ‘ next of kin’ of the plaintiff must be those who answer that description at her death, who may be very different persons from her administrators.” In the last edition of his celebrated treatise on Powers, pp. 638, 639, Lord St. Leonards states this to be the law, using the very words of the Master of the Rolls. In Edwards <em>v. </em>Saloway, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Phillips%20625" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Phillips 625">2 Phillips 625</a>, it was held by Lord Cottenham, that a gift to trustees by will of a fund in trust for the wife’s separate use for life, and after her death, as to part for such persons as she should appoint by deed or will, and in default of such appoint<a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>xnent, a gift thereof unto and amongst her next of kin, as in the case of distribution of intestates’ effects, prevents a lapse by-death in her husband’s lifetime, and her next of kin take. This case is stated to be the law by Lord St. Leonards, and also in 2 Jarman on Wills (3d ed.), p. 721; Tudor’s Lead. Oases on Real Property (2d ed.), p. 815. The same doctrine is laid down in Hansen <em>v. </em>Miller, 14 Simons 22, Vice-Chancellor Shadwell saying (p. 26), “ The other argument in favour of the lady’s claim was founded on the trusts of the settlement; I mean the trust which gives her power to dispose of the fund by her will, and the ultimate trust in favour of her next of kin. But m.y opinion is, that as the law now stands, neither of those trusts can be held to enlarge the interest which she takes under the first trust,” which was to pay her the income during her life; and the declaration made by the vice-chancellor was, that she was absolutely entitled to the dividends of the consols <em>during her life.</em>

Rep. 388</a>: “ Where an estate is given to a person generally or indefinitely with a power of disposition, it carries a fee, and the only exception to the rule is, when the testator gives to the first taker an estate for life only, by certain and express words, and annexes <em>to it </em>a power of disposah In that particular and special case, the devisee for life will not take an estate in fee, notwithstanding the distinct and naked gift of a power of disposition of the reversion:” 4 Kent’s Com. 633, 634, 9th ed. In Mintham’s Appeal, 11 S. &amp; R. 19, Judge Gibson applies the rule to personal estate. “ In general,” says he, “ the bequest of a legacy to be at the disposal of the legatee, is a bequest of the absolute interests; but a power of disposition at death, engrafted on an express limitation for the life of the legatee, will not enlarge his interest by implication against the express intention of the testator.” The same rule is stated by the same learned judge, when chief justice, in Morris <em>v. </em>Phalen, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20390" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Watts 390">1 Watts 390</a>, and in Hess <em>v. </em>Hess, 5 Id. 191, where the chief justice says: “ The implication of absolute ownership from a general power of disposal, may be rebutted by the express gift of a lesser interest, which is inconsistent with it. Such is the principle of Morris <em>v. </em>Phalen, and the cases from which it was extracted.” Smith <em>v. </em>Starr, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%2062" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Whart. 62">3 Whart. 62</a>, was decided upon the principle above stated by Chancellor Kent, in Jackson <em>v. </em>Robins.</p>

That, however, was the case of real estate, and there was an additional provisión tending to show that the testator intended to protect the estate devised in trust against the creditors of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>the son. Yaux <em>v. </em>Parke determined that the <em>cestui que trust </em>had not such an estate in the land as was bound by the judgment, which it was essential he should have, in order that it might be taken in execution and sold. In the present case the income for life could have been secured to the son by provisions against alienation and liability for debts, but this has not been done,’and we are reluctantly obliged to defeat the intention of the mother to provide a maintenance for her son, by giving the income during the life of the son to the attaching creditor, who can receive from the trustees only what the son would be entitled to.</p>
