    <p id="b473-9" data-blocks='[["BL_473.9",473,[182,964,1175,1200]]]'>It is very evident from the record that in all these points the plaintiffs failed. It will be alleged that the court did open the judgment on the application of Haslett, on condition that he would pay the balance of the purchase-money in thirty days; and that by Haslett failing he loses his equity by his own neglect. Our reply is, that the court had no power to fix the time within which Haslett should pay or lose his rights or equities in the land. The court had no legal power to direct such a judgment to be entered in the case against him, either before or after thirty days, or with conditions or without them. The equities of' a vendee are not to be destroyed but by strictly pursuing the course laid down by law : Ferguson &amp; Betts <em>v. </em>Staver, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20213" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Wright 213">4 Wright 213</a>.

Even if the court had the power, the conditions imposed operated most unjustly and inequitably towards the plaintiff in error. He had paid $2166.33, or one-third of the purchase-money, and the court in effect gave plaintiffs below the land, unless Haslett would pay them the balance of the purchase-money in thirty days. But this same court had, about fifteen months before, delivered to the plaintiffs below the land which Haslett has thus purchased. And yet, without regard to the possession of the land by the plaintiffs below during that time, and without their accounting for the profits derived by them from land, amounting, as plaintiff in error alleges, to many thousand dollars, and perhaps more than the balance of the purchase-money, Haslett was required by the court to pay them, in addition to said profits, the whole balance of the purchase-money in thirty days, or lose the land.</p>

It is argued that the proviso to the Act of 1852 requires notice in fact, and that no such notice appears. The terms of the proviso itself have express reference to the suits named in the Act of 1858, and no others. The Act of 1851 embraces but a single class of cases, viz., ejectments brought to enforce specific performance of contracts. These are proceedings <em>in rein. </em>They are based upon the legal ownership of the land, and usually upon the legal title ; from their nature they presuppose the defendant in default, and in them the law requires the vendee to be active, prompt, and eager. The Act of 1858 extends the provisions of the Act of 1851, relative to the service of writs, to all cases where “claimants bring ejectments” “whenever the adverse claimant” resides out of the county, &amp;c. Vendor and vendee are the terms used in the Act of 1851 — claimants and adverse claimants are the words used in the Act of 1858. These terms are essentially different in their legal signification. When we say vendor and vendee, we understand that one claims title under and through the other. When we use the terms claimant and adverse claimant, we understand that one claims against, and not through or under the other. In the class of cases covered by the Act of 1858, the ownership of the legal title may be the very point in controversy; in them the question of right is to be tried, and the adverse claimant is given his day in court, whilst in the proceedings for specific performance, the course is analogous to the return of two <em>nihils </em>upon a <em>sei. fa. sur mortgage. </em>The one under the Act of 1851 is essentially a proceeding <em>in rem; </em>the other, under the Act of 1858, affects the title and the person.</p>

He had notice of this proceeding prior to January Term 1861; he appeared in court at that time. Why not tender his money then? At March Term 1861, the plaintiffs offered to give him his deed — to yield him the possession — if he would pay the purchase-money. The order of 19th March 1861 ■was made, and even then no money was tendered. The 19th April 1861, was fixed by the order of court for confirmation of the contract.
