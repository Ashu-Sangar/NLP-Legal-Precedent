The will, in its second item, gave what the testator called, and what the evidence shows, was a very liberal share of the decedent’s estate.

The testator having given for his widow’s support a. large share of his estate, much larger than by law she was entitled to, provides immediately after for the children who he contemplated might be born to him. While his widow occupying a house might, in the testator’s view and wishes, receive a payment for its rent, which if he had children would be the house they would also live in, it would be unreasonable to suppose the testator meant his widow to receive $1000 a year in addition to the very large share of his estate already given her, she should have the power to divert this additional sum from the purpose for which, and for which alone, he designed it. That he died without children can make no difference. We are bound to consider the scheme of his will as he planned it, and to lay hold of its <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>four corners to reach a proper construction where a claim is set up under it in opposition to its words.

The giving of the furniture implied the occupancy of a house. It is true, that where a testator gives a sum in gross, and names a purpose to which it may be applied, the legatee is entitled to receive the money directly, because the law requires nothing to be done in vain: 15 Simons 82; 16 Id. 266. But here the case is quite different. The annuity is not given for maintenance. That has already been provided for. It is not given for a purpose which, the moment it is executed, may be changed by the legatee. But it is given for a specified object, and directed to be allowed and paid for that object only, the object being one that may or may not arise, which may continue, be interrupted at intervals, and again arise; and for which, when it does arise, an allowance or provision has been made by the testator in such manner as clearly to show his sense of the recurring necessity incidental to such object.</p>

That words in a will, expressive of desire, recommendation, and confidence, are not words of technical but common parlance, and are not <em>primd facie </em>sufficient to convert a devise or bequest into a trust; and the old Roman and English rule on this subject is not part of the common law of Pennsylvania. 2d. Such words may amount to a declaration of trust, when it appears, from other parts of the will, that the testator intended not to commit the estate to the devisee or legatee, or the ultimate disposal of it to his kindness, justice, or discretion. 3d. By such will the absolute ownership of the personal property is given to the widow, with an expression of mere expectation that she will use and dispose of it discreetly as a mother, and that no trust is created thereby,” and this I believe is the present English doctrine. The former decisions in that case had given the widow only the income for life merely, -and made her a trustee for the children of the principal.</p>

Beck made his last will and testament on the 23d May 1857, and a codicil thereto, dated the 6th May 1858, and a testamentary memorandum, dated 15th June 1857, all of which were ■ duly proved on the 15th March 1859; and letters testamentary were granted to the executrix and executors, Sarah R. G. Beck, Thomas Balch, Aubrey II. Smith, and Henry Paul Beck.</p>
    <p id="b533-7" data-blocks='[["BL_533.7",533,[136,1556,1170,773]]]'>The testator died at Rome, in February 1859, leaving a widow but no issue. The second clause in his will rvas in these words: “Second. I direct that my wife, Sarah Rose Grier Beck, shall receive out of the income of my estate an annuity of $4000, payable quarterly in advance; the same to be and to be taken for and instead of dower or claim to dower in my estate, or any part thereof, the said annuity being a very liberal share of the income of my estate, and being' also the most certain and least troublesome mode of securing her a competent support..” There is no dispute about the meaning of this clause. The third clause is in these words: “Third. I desire and direct my executors to allow my wife, Sarah Rose Grier Beck, during her widowhood, $1000 per annum, to be paid in the same manner, and at the same time, as they pay her yearly annuity of $4000, as herein-before provided for. The above-mentioned sum of $1000 is in addition to said annuity of $4000, and is to be paid to her for house-rent, but only so long as she shall remain my widow, and is to cease upon her marrying again.”</p>

This is contrary not only to all the authorities, but also to the very words themselves. It is a bequest of an additional annuity during widowhood, which is the only condition annexed to it, and it is payable in advance, and is given absolutely, the subsequent words not limiting or controlling the payment, but only assigning a reason for the increase. These words create neither a condition nor trust, and do not give the executors the slightest power over the legacy. But there is a clause in the codicil which shows this was the real intention of the testator.</p>
    <p id="b534-5" data-blocks='[["BL_534.5",534,[305,860,1169,345]]]'>By his testamentary memorandum he had given his wife his household furniture, properly so called, with some few exceptions, and in the fourth clause of his codicil he says: “ I direct that my wife be allowed the use and occupation of my house, my present residence, for one year after my decease, free of rent and taxes, if she wish so to keep and occupy the same; and in all other respects, I do confirm my said will.” The effect was to give her the house-rent free, and the $5000 also.</p>
    <p id="b534-6" data-blocks='[["BL_534.6",534,[306,1204,1169,345]]]'>It is clear, therefore, that the payments of the $1000 annuity, made by the executors, were properly allowed, and that they should have been regularly continued to be paid by them, but as the several quarterly sums have remained in the hands of the Pennsylvania Company for Insurance of Lives, &amp;c., we will reduce the interest on these sums to the interest allowed by the company; and with this alteration, the decree of the Orphans’ Court is affirmed, at the costs of the appellant.</p>
    <p id="b534-7" data-blocks='[["BL_534.7",534,[352,1592,1120,44]]]'>Woodward, C. J., was at Nisi Prius when this case was argued.</p>
