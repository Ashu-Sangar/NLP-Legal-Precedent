That though the question of the deed being void, if not recorded in time, is a conceded point under the whole line of decisions, it can only be avoided by those who take advantage of it, but that as to others the trust remains, and that equity will support it by the appointment of an assignee, where the party to whom the assignment was made, refuses to accept the trust. That the main and important-question as to when the deed should be recorded, which is dependent upon the question of what constitutes the execution of a deed, is the one upon which this case must stand or fall; and that therefore the question arises, what constitutes a deed ? A deed is a writing sealed and delivered by the parties. In this case McDowell, to whom the assignment was made, refused to accept the trust,- and the deed, therefore, remained in the hands of the assignor until after the appointment, by the Court of Common Pleas, of William F. Johnson as assignee ; which appointment took place on the 28th day of February 1862, when the deed was delivered to Johnson, and by him recorded the following day. That the deed was not executed until delivered, and the recording having taken place the day after delivery to Johnson, it was recorded within the time prescribed by the statute: citing Leland’s Appeal, 1 Harris 85; Chess <em>v. </em>Chess, 1 Penna. Rep. 32; Donnel <em>v. </em>Bellas, 10 Barr 346; McKinney <em>v. </em>Rhoads, <a href="/watts/5/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts 343" data-case-ids="1843982" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0343-01">5 Watts 343</a>; Critchfield <em>v. </em>Critchfield, 12 Harris 102 ; Shoenberger’s Ex’rs. <em>v. </em>Zook, 10 Casey 28; Boardman <em>v. </em>Dean, 10 Id. 254; Barncord <em>v. </em>Kuhn, 12 Id. 389. That the Act of Assembly seems to contemplate a distinction between the making and executing a deed of assignment, inasmuch as it says, “ that all assignments made and executed shall be recorded within thirty days after execution, showing that the making of the deed was not intended to embrace the execution thereof. That the present cases do not stand in the situation of one intervening between the making of the deed and the delivery thereof, because the original suits upon which judgments were and <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>not commenced against the Saving Eund until nine months after the appointment of William E.

But in the argument of the plaintiff in error before this court, a new point of defence is set up, viz., that the deed of assignment from the Saving Eund to McDowell was not delivered to the said. McDowell, and was never delivered until to Johnson on the 28th day of February 1862, the day Johnson was substituted assignee in the place of McDowell, declining; and that the execution was not complete until that day. This question is raised too late. A party cannot avail himself of a defence in a court of error, which he did not make at the trial: Snevily <em>v. </em>Egle, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 480" data-case-ids="1852503" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0480-01">1 W. &amp; S. 480</a> ; Drexell <em>v. </em>Mann, 6 Id. 343; Whilmarth <em>v. </em>Mountford, 8 S. &amp; E. 124.</p>
    <p id="b418-8" data-blocks='[["BL_418.10",418,[298,1458,1161,600]]]'>The question of the delivery of the deed was a question of fact which the defendant should have raised at the trial. The plaintiff’s counsel in the court below, gave in evidence the deed of assignment from the Saving Eund to McDowell; it was then incumbent on the defence, if they wished to raise the point of non-execution or non-delivery, to prove that it was executed and delivered on some day other than the day that the same bears date and acknowledgment; “the presumption being that said deed was delivered on the day of its date ; the burden of proof being on the party alleging a delivery on another day:” Greenl. on Ev. vol. 2, § 297, p. 346.

The Act of Assembly of March 24th 1818, P. L. 285, after regulating by its earlier sections voluntary assignments made or executed for the benefit of creditors, enacted “that all assignments so as aforesaid to be made and executed, which shall not be recorded in the office for recording of deeds in the county in which such assignor resides, within thirty days after the execution thereof, shall be considered null and void, as against any of the creditors of the assignor.” In these cases the assignment was dated on the 29th day of January 1862. The presumption arising from the instrument itself, is that it was made and delivered on that day. True, this presumption might have been rebutted by proof that no delivery was made until a later time, but there was nothing in the evidence given on the trials .to rebut it. The assignee named declined to accept the trust, but that may well have been a fact, and yet the delivery of the deed have been perfect. . It may have been made to another person, or left with the scrivener for the use of the creditors, and if so, refusal of the assignee named to act, would not have defeated the deed of the assignors.</p>
    <p id="b419-9" data-blocks='[["BL_419.11",419,[152,2078,1167,306]],["BL_420.1",420,[328,393,1150,76]]]'>A trust does not fail for want of a trustee. A delivery of an assignment is good when the instrument has passed out of the control of the assignors, with their assent to its taking effect. Certainly there ivas nothing in the answers of the garnishee in these cases, nor the plaintiff in error, to show that the assignment was first delivered on the 28th day of February 1862, when he was appointed trustee in place of the assignee, who had declined. <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>It cannot then he doubted that when he was appointed, the instrument took effect from its date.</p>
    <p id="b420-6" data-blocks='[["BL_420.6",420,[324,479,1155,899]]]'>The real question in these cases, however, is, what did the legislature mean when they declared that assignments not recorded within thirty days after they are made and executed, shall be considered null and void as against creditors? Was it meant that the thirty days allowed for recording shall begin to run from the time when a new trustee shall be appointed, in case the one named in the instrument declines to act, or from the time when the assignors have completed the deed, ordinarily its date ? We think the latter is the intention of the act. Delivery, though necessary to give effect to any deed, is an act done after, in common language, the deed has been made or executed. The evidence of it may rest entirely in parol. It is not usually attended with any publicity, and if, in cases of voluntary assignments, it is necessary to look beyond the deeds themselves to know when they became operative, a wide door is opened for establishing secret trusts, which it was the manifest purpose of the legislature to restrain. Nor is there any hardship in adopting such a construction. The assignment may be placed upon record by the assignors, or by any one having a legal or beneficial interest. Our opinion therefore is, that the points proposed by the plaintiff in error were correctly answered in the District Court.</p>
