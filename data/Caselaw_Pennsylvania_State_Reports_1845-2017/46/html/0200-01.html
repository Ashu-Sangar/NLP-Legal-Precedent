She claimed, therefore, to recover the undivided fifth part of the land as heir at law of her father. The defendants claimed under a deed dated June 26th 1853, by which Andrew Lantz had conveyed these lands “to the heirs of his son; Andrew Lantz,” said Andrew being then in full life, and on the trial offered to prove by a witness that he drew the deed from the grantor to the grantees, at the request of the grantor, and that the grantor knew, when he executed the deed, that his son Andrew was living, and that the grantor named over his grandchildren by his son Andrew, viz., Ellen, Ruth, Eliza, Mary Jane, and Catherine Margaret, and said to the witness, when he was writing the deed, h.e was going to convey the land to them, and directed the witness to make the deed to the “heirs of his son Andrew,” so as to include any children that might be born thereafter to his son Andrew, as well as those then living, and that the grantor said it was his intention to make the deeds to his grandchildren — the children of his son Andrew — and that he said the words “ heirs of his son Andrew” would include all the children of his son Andrew, born and to be born, for the purpose of showing that the grantor, by the use of the words “heirs of his son Andrew Lantz,” meant the children of his son Andrew, who were then in full life, and that he intended to convey the land mentioned in the deed to bis grandchildren, the then living children of his son Andrew.</p>

He may have been mistaken with respect to the fitness and capacity of the terms employed to effect the purpose intended, but this will not justify us in admitting parol evidence to substitute other words for them, or to show that they were designed to have a meaning and force different from that which the law assigns to them.</p>

But we think the term ‘heirs,’ as used here, must have its legal signification. There are some cases where this word has been construed to mean children in devises, because it was absolutely necessary to effect the intention of the testator; <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>but we know of no case where it has been so construed in a deed. On the contrary, it has been repeatedly said that, in a deed or written contract, words of art must have their technical meaning: <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%2090" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Watts 90">4 Watts 90</a>; 9 Harris 344.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b202-7" data-blocks='[["BL_202.7",202,[299,693,1163,462]]]'>“To do this would be to limit the grant to a part of the class of persons who are described or attempted to be described as the grantees. And if the defendants inform us truly, it would, at least in part, defeat the intention of the grantor, for they have offered to prove that he used the term ‘ heirs’ for the very purpose of embracing any after-born children of Andrew Lantz, Jr., as well as his heirs apparent. But we do not determine the question with a view to any supposed intention of the grantor. We look, to the deed itself, and we think it defective in that it does not distinguish with any reasonable certainty who are to take under it.</p>

      <em>“ </em>We know that grants should receive the most benign construction, and in cases of doubt be most strongly construed against the grantor. But there must be somebody <em>in esse to </em>whom the descriptive words designating the grantees will apply. And enough must appear to ascertain the grantees, and to distinguish them from all others. Herein this deed is fatally defective. We are not aware of any judicial decision upon this question in Pennsylvania; but the very point was decided by the Superior Court of Massachusetts: <a href="/mass/18/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Pick. 27" data-case-ids="2070961" data-case-paths="/mass/18/0028-01">1 Pick. 27</a>.

In the <em>habendum, </em>in the covenant of warranty, and wherever else they are referred to, they are mentioned in the merely formal language of parties of the second part. If there were in any part of the conveyance words sufficiently descriptive to distinguish the grantees, we would of course lay hold of them to support the grant. But there is the same uncertainty throughout the deed. And as we cannot find anything in it to help out the inadequate description of the grantees, that the grant may be upheld, so we are unable to discover anything which will permit us to treat the conveyance as a covenant to stand seised to the use of the heirs of Andrew Lantz, Jr.</p>

This decision is fully sustained by authority by the opinion of the court in the case of Hall <em>v. </em>Leonard, <a href="/mass/18/0028-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Pick. 27" data-case-ids="2070961" data-case-paths="/mass/18/0028-01">1 Pick. 27</a>, and by the citations there made, and by others furnished by the counsel here.</p>

That general and indefinite form of transmission is necessarily allowed in wills, because they are always intended to go into effect at a future time, and to provide for future and uncertain events, and must therefore be allowed to have that degree of indefiniteness relative to the donees that is involved in the very nature of the act; it must be allowed to provide, not only for individuals named, but for described classes of donees, to be ascertained by evidence at the death of the testator or afterwards, just as it dispenses with delivery of the written assurance, with livery of seisin, one or other of which is necessary in present conveyances.</p>

As there must be definite parties, grantor and grantee, in such acts, a grant to uncertain persons is no grant at all, except grants and dedications to public and charitable uses. If the grantor knows his grantees well enough to deliver the deed to them, he knows them well enough to name them. It would be mere folly to make a conveyance to my next door neighbour or- to the person now sitting at the table with me, by this description, instead of by name, and the law could hardly be expected to enforce such a conveyance in the face of the statute that requires conveyances to be in writing and to be self-sustaining, with the exception only <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>of such necessary uncertainty as is involved in their application to named persons and described things.</p>

No doubt we ought not to permit our <em>professional </em>forms and technicalities to interfere with the administration of the people’s business ; but neither ought we to disregard the <em>popular </em>forms and technicalities by which ordinary business is done, and by which we are to judge what is intended. Substance and principle are invaluable, but we can apprehend them only by the forms under which they are manifested, and which are inseparable from them, though changeable in their nature. It is society, and not professional forms and technicalities, that has made a writing, naming the parties and describing the subject-matter, an essential form of the conveyance of land. Even laws themselves are only the forms by which principles are defined and made certain and practical, and we should run- into the most disastrous uncertainty if we should banish these forms in order to rely only on their principles.</p>

Society cannot afford to give up its laws, which secure the regularity and order and comprehensibility of business transactions, for the sake of accommodating men of peculiar habits and sustaining their odd and strange devices.</p>

Shall we say the children living at the date of the deed ? His use of the word <em>heirs </em>indicates that he meant more than this. Shall we confine it to them in order that the deed shall not fail of effect altogether? Then we force the intention in order to give the deed effect, instead of executing it according to intention.
