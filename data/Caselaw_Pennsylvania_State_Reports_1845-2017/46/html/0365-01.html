That after said purchase, and after said buildings were erected, the grade of said Washington street was fixed and determined by the councils of said city, to wit: in the year 1861, and when the same came to be actually graded, in the fall of 1861, the same was graded about three feet lower, through the property of said Mary Roe, than was fixed by the grade adopted by councils in 1851.

That they appraised her damages at the sum of $3330, and assessed that sum upon properties situated on Washington, Webster, Wylie, Logan, and several other streets.
