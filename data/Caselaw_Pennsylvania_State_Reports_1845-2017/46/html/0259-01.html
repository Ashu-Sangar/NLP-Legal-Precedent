That there was no patent or manifest alteration of the note sued upon. The defendant admits the genuineness of his signature, and of the endorsement, but alleges that the words “Payable at N. Holmes &amp; Son” were added after the making and delivery of the note. The handwriting is uniform, and seems to have been executed with the same pen and ink, and by the same hand. We do not think there is anything suspicious about the appearance of the note, and if there was, it would certainly be a question for the jury. The plaintiff, in the present case, desired to submit the note to the inspection of the jury, and he had the right to do so. There was nothing about the note that indicated that it had been altered or tampered with after its execution; and it devolved upon the defendant to establish his defence, to wit, that the words “Payable at N. Holmes &amp; Son” had been added to the note after its execution and delivery. We cannot find a case wherein the question of fact as to the alteration or non-alteration of a written instrument was withheld from the jury, and decided by the court. If the question is doubtful, upon an inspection of the writing, a jury should decide it; but in the present case, there was no presumption against the genuineness of the note, and it should have been allowed to go to the jury, like other evidence in a cause.</p>

The Southwark Bank <em>v. </em>Gross <em>et al., </em>11 Casey 80, was exactly like the present case. The defendants pleaded and gave evidence tending to prove that certain words <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>were added after the execution of'the note, making it payable at a particular place.

Holmes &amp; Son” were interlined after the note was signed by the maker. This was a material alteration, patent on its face, and vitiated the note, unless the holder could account for it. The note was therefore rightly rejected: Simpson <em>v. </em>Stackhouse, 9 State Rep. 186; Kennedy <em>v. </em>Lancaster County Bank, 18 Id. 347; Paine <em>u. </em>Edsell, 19 Id. 180. In the case cited by plaintiff’s counsel, 11 Casey 80, this question, as to the onus of proof, was not raised nor decided. It is no explanation to say that these words are in the handwriting of S. H. McGuier, one of the payees, the same as the body of the note; for if so, it should have been shown by what authority he added them after the note was signed. It was then an evident alteration by the payee.</p>

They were admitted to be in the handwriting of one of the payees who wrote the body of the note, and they certainly look as if added after the signature. Had they been written in a straight line from where they started, they would have interfered with the signature, but they slant upward so as to avoid it, and thus give the paper a very suspicious aspect.</p>

According to the doctrine of that case, the endorsee, who sues this note, took it with its imperfections on its head, and was bound to come into court prepared to explain them. The words added were a material alteration, and were as suspicious as similar words in Simpson <em>v. </em>Stack-house.</p>
