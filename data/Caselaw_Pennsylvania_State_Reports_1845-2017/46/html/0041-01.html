J.-), after stating the case, charged the jury, that the “judgment against the plaintiff was entered to cover a certain claim attached for goods sold, and when such goods were sold the judgment was to be satisfied. The plaintiffs say this money has been paid, and that the money was paid into court in Allegheny county, Maryland, in 1854, to satisfy said judgment. From my recollection of the testimony, the sum paid into court was $150. The plaintiff has produced the depositions of S. M. Semmes and James Reynolds, which, it is alleged, proves the payment of said judgment. There is a discrepancy in the dates. The money was paid into court in 1854, and the judgment confessed on the 22d of May 1856. In the process of attachment, if such process in Maryland is conducted as such cases are in Pennsylvania, there is generally more delay than in common actions. We submit the testimony to you to find whether said judgment was paid, or provision made for its payment at the time-the insurance was given, on the 12th September 1856. If the judgment was no encumbrance, and did not mislead or deceive the insurance company when the policy was issued, your verdict should be for the plaintiff for the amount insured.</p>

The deceit practised by the issued as to the risk should be considered, in a reasonable manner, a small judgment for $20 or $30, or even $100, which was an encumbrance on the lot, we submit it to you to say whether it would be such a deception as would affect the character of the risk. If you believe that it would not affect the risk, that is, if such an answer would not endanger the payment of the assessment on the premium note, or the payment of the premium note itself, then the verdict should be for the plaintiff.</p>

The policy was dated 12th of September 1856-1-thé property insured was situated in Maryland, and a record' of the Circuit Court of Allegheny county, in that state, was given in evidence to show that on the 22d May 1856, McAnally had confessed a judgment for $95 in a. suit' of attachment by one Henry B. Martin against him. Was this judgment a lien upon the property insured ?</p>
    <p id="b43-12" data-blocks='[["BL_43.15",43,[200,1656,1166,519]]]'>It appears, by the record, that Henry B. Martin had obtained a judgment against John Martin, whose goods and chattels had been sold by McAnally, as constable, on .some other process. To get at the moneys in McAnally’s hands, arising from the sale, Henry B. Martin attached McAnally, who confessed a judgment for the above amount, the plaintiff’s counsel stipulating in writing at the time that he had “ agreed with defendant’s counsel not to extend the judgment beyond the proceeds of sale realized by, and due on promissory notes to James McAnally, for the goods and chattels of John Martin, sold by him as constable under various executions, issued in certain attachment cases, which .were appealed from; and afterwards reversed.”</p>

Martin had been paid him. But however this fact was, it is certain that the judgment against McAnally extended to nothing beyond these funds. Under the laws of Maryland a general judgment in an attach<a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>ment suit would have been a lien on McAnally’s real estate, and he would be bound to disclose it to the insurance company in obtaining a policy on that property, but the lien of this judgment was limited, and did not extend to the property insured. There was no fraud, therefore, in failing to- disclose it. There was not even an inaccuracy of statement. He said there was no lien on what he wanted to insure, and the record produced by the company failed to show that there was any. It is not worth while to consider the verbal criticisms of the charge, for, however just they may be, the only ground of defence set up by the company failed them so entirely that it was very -right to render judgment against them.</p>
