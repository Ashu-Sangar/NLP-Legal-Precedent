    <p class="summary" id="b58-8" data-blocks='[["BL_58.8",58,[299,816,1161,1202]]]'>The case was this: — ’Bertolet &amp; Co. owned and carried on a rolling-mill in the city of Reading, Berks county, at which they manufactured plate and bar-iron, and employed a large number of workmen. These workmen consisted, first, of those who worked for a certain sum per day; and secondly, those who worked, as it is termed, “ by the piece,” or for a fixed price per ton of iron. In this as in many, perhaps all, rolling-mills, it was considered advantageous both for .the proprietors and workmen, to have certain kinds of work done, not at so much per day for the labour bestowed, but at a fixed price per ton of iron manipulated. One of the men employed was necessarily an experienced and skilful mechanic; the others were his assistants, or “helpers,” as they are termed. Thus a ton of iron passed through the process of puddling, two or three men working together upon it. So in regard to heating, squeezing, and rolling iron; in each process there was engaged one principal and skilful workman, and one or more helpers. These principal workmen were paid by the proprietors of the mill a certain amount for each ton of iron manipulated, and out of the amount so received, the former paid a certain proportion, as agreed upon, to their helpers. The proprietors, as a rule, did not pay any money to the helpers, though in the case of one of them an account was kept of coal furnished for family use, the price of which was deducted, upon settlement, from the amounts paid to his principal. Until within a few months of the failure of Bertolet &amp; Co., the workmen of all kinds were paid at the expiration of each month. The iron, fuel, machinery, motive power, and tools were all furnished by Bertolet &amp; Co., and the work was all done in their mill.</p>

This sum covered all the wages due and unpajd on the 31st day of December 1860. Upon this judgment execution was issued, and the money made by a sale of the personal property of Bertolet &amp; Co., consisting of manufactured and raw iron, coal, &amp;c,, and the <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>amount of the judgment properly distributed among the workmen. On the same day, but at a subsequent hour, Kauffman &amp; Kissinger also issued an execution against Bertolet &amp; Co., upon a judgment for $950, confessed in order to secure the amount of a store bill.</p>

The amounts claimed by each were set out in the list which accompanied the notice; the whole sum of which amounted to $753.91; and it was admitted that these amounts were correctly stated.</p>

On the 12th August 1861, the commissioner filed a “ second and corrected report.” In this last report he distributed to the labourers who worked by the day, the sum of $401.12, and awarded the balance, $877.83, to Kauffman &amp; Kissinger, on account of their execution, throwing out of the distribution and rejecting the claims of the men who worked by the ton, or “ by contract,” as the commissioner stated, and their assistants or helpers, amounting to $352.79. In this report there was what was called by him “ a second distribution.” To the first distribution of the commissioner, Daniel Seiders, and the others who worked by the ton and their helpers, excepted; but the Court of Common Pleas dismissed the exceptions, and confirmed the report of the commissioner ; which was the Orror assigned.</p>

The evidence shows that there were a number of persons employed by Bertolet <em>k </em>Co. who did their work by contract; that is to say, the heaters and puddlers did their work by the ton, and employed others to help them. The persons so employed to help, Bertolet &amp; Co. were in no way liable to pay. The helpers’ names never appeared on the books of the firm, and were never in any case paid by them. They were not mechanics and labourers employed by them, and are therefore not entitled to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of their property. The names of these helpers are not found in the judgment given to secure the workmen, and it was upon this judgment that the property was sold. Bertolet &amp; Co. did not recognise them as their employees. They could never have brought suit against the firm for their claim: by what right, then, can they come on the proceeds of sale for payment ?</p>
    <p id="b60-6" data-blocks='[["BL_60.8",60,[284,1136,1161,975]]]'>2. Can contractors come in on the proceeds of sale as against Kauffman &amp; Kissinger, execution-creditors ? The evidence of Leaf shows that one of the rollers employed some six men and boys, and that another employed as many as eight and ten hands. The law was never intended to protect such labour; for, if so, the limitation of $50 would not be sufficient. Take the case of the one who employed some ten hands to perform his contract. If he could get $50, that would make a division of $50 between the ten hands and himself, or less than $5 for each. The 1st section of the act says, “ mechanics and labourers employed by such person or persons.” The 8d section says, “ such officers shall pay to such miners, mechanics, or labourers, out of the proceeds of sale, the amount each is just and legally entitled to receive.” The act is intended only to protect and secure the labourer who earns the money with his hands. It was not designed to protect the contractors, who,' by their contracts, speculated upon or made profit out of the labour of others. These contractors have attempted to get around the act limiting the amount to $50, for when their claim is more than that sum, they then put in the names of their employees. In the case of The Pennsylvania Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Costello, 9 Casey 241, the claimant did the work himself, and his assistant only removed the dirt and rubbish.</p>
    <p id="b60-7" data-blocks='[["BL_60.9",60,[283,2122,1161,128]]]'>3. The claim of Henry Richards, one of the appellants, is even more objectionable. His claim on the proceeds of sale was not for his own labour, but for horses, carts, and drivers.</p>

By laborers we mean those who perform with their own hands the contract they make with the employer; and where the nature of the work contracted for is of a nature to require helpers of the chief workman, and he employs his helpers, he is to be considered as authorized to do so by the proprietor, and the wages earned by such helpers are as much within the protection of the statute as the wages of the chief workman himself. The statute does indeed limit itself to persons employed by the proprietor, but proprietors may employ hands through an agent, and when the owner of a rolling-mill lets a job to a roller, puddler, heater, or other master workman at' so much the ton, he impliedly authorizes him to employ all necessary helpers. Permitting such subordinates to labour in his rolling-mill for his benefit is a strong implication of his assent to their employment. We do not mean that the presumption would be such as would support an action at law against the proprietor, but only such as admits the helpers to the benefit of the"special statute.</p>
