Orr, on the 19th day of December 1859, amounted to nearly $16,000. The judgments entered of record in the same county, before the 17th day of May 1860, the day on which execution could have been issued on the plaintiff’s judgment, amounted to from $6000 to $10,000 more. All the real estate of J. M. Orr was sold at judicial sale at or before April 1861, and the proceeds applied to the liens which were prior to the judgment of Henry Baker, for the use of Hugh Campbell. The real estate of J. M. Orr, in Butler county, was sold, and the proceeds were not sufficient to satisfy the liens in that county. It was averred by defendant that Campbell had extended the time of payment to Orr for six months, during which time Orr was solvent; and reference was made to the “testimony of Orr in the judge’s notes but none of the testimony was printed in the paper-books of either plaintiff or defendant.</p>
