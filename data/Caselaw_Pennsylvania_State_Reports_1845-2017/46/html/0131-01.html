The executor named in the will refused to act, and on the 3d August 1852, John E. Shaffer was, at the instance of the widow, appointed administrator, <em>cum testamento annexo. </em>On the 15th of July 1853, he filed with the register his account, showing a balance in his hands of $29.29, which was confirmed October 3d 1853, and to which no exceptions were filed. This account did not state on the face of it that it was a final account, but it had all the appearance of being a full and final settlement, and was so intended by the administrator. For several years after this settlement, Shaffer acted as the agent of the widow, Polly Doughty, in renting her property, collecting the rents, &amp;c. On the 16th of December 1857, they had a settlement, when Mrs. Doughty gave him the following receipt:—</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b132-7" data-blocks='[["BL_132.7",132,[284,693,1162,1061]]]'>On the 29th of May 1858, Polly Doughty presented her petition to the Orphans’ Court, setting forth that Mr. Shaffer had neglected, in his inventory and settlement, to charge himself with a claim of the estate against William B. Walker of about $400, and praying for a citation to compel him to make a full settlement. On the 1st of July 1858, Shaffer filed an answer, in which he stated that his settlement of 1853 was a full and complete, settlement of said estate as far as the same was under his control, and was so regarded and treated both by himself and the said Polly Doughty; that since the filing of said account he had received no money or assets of said estate; that after said settlement, and with full knowledge of the same, and regarding it as a final settlement of the estate, the said Polly Doughty had employed him as her agent in attending to her affairs, and that on the 16th of December 1857, he had settled in full with her; that the claim against William B. Walker had never been collected by him, because the widow had taken it into her own hands, as she had a right to do, being entitled to it by the will; had prevented him from collecting it; had given time to Walker, and collected part of it herself. He further set forth that, as his settlement in 1853 was a final settlement, he could not be called upon to file another account; but that if Polly Doughty had any cause of complaint, her remedy was by bill of review, or by suit on his administration bond. He therefore prayed the court to dismiss the citation at her costs.</p>

To this account exceptions were filed by the widow, and it was referred to an auditor. The only matter in controversy was the Walker claim.</p>

If there was any error or omission in that account, her remedy was by bill of review, and not by citation upon the administrator to settle another account.

If the administrator had wholly neglected for four years to take any steps to collect this claim, and it was then lost through the failure of William B. Walker, doubtless he would be liable. But the evidence proves that the administrator was eager and pressing for the claim, and would have collected it but for the interference of the widow, who was entitled to it under the will. But the auditor thought that because no specified time was given for the indulgence, the administrator was chargeable, inasmuch as he did not sue for the claim within six months after the indulgence had been given. But it was that very interference which stopped the administrator in his efforts to collect the claim that lost it. He delayed to proceed, at her request, and to favour her. He acted in perfect good faith, and, according to the doctrine in Keller’s Appeal, should not be charged with the loss.</p>

      <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>We are therefore of opinion that the Orphans’ Court proceeded according to law in citing the appellant to file his account of the debt due the estate of Jesse Doughty, deceased, by Walker, for which he recovered judgment nearly four years after the settlement of his first account in the Orphans’ Court. His affidavit of claim preparatory to bringing suit was made about a year before suit brought. There was no pretence of denial of the official character in which these proceedings were had, or that the accountant had ever been discharged as administrator. It was right, therefore, to call on him to settle an account for these assets.</p>
    <p id="b135-6" data-blocks='[["BL_135.6",135,[215,842,1163,860]]]'>We have also carefully examined the auditor’s report, upon the exception to the claim of the accountant, for a credit of the amount of the claim against Walker, on the ground that he was insolvent and the debt desperate. The auditor was of opinion that the debt was lost by the negligence of the accountant, and charged him with it. We discover no error in this. It would seem from the testimony that Walker was solvent from the death of decedent until within five or six months of the time judgment was obtained. It might therefore have been collected years before suit was finally brought. The accountant was not justifiable in postponing the collection by anything Mrs. Doughty said or did in the premises. But supposing she might have made such an agreement to give Walker time as would estop her from calling on the administrator to account for it, it being lost by insolvency in the mean time, it is enough that she did not give him any fixed period of time. So that the administrator might have proceeded to enforce payment of the debt the next hour after what occurred between Mrs. Doughty and the agent of Walker. For these reasons the decree is affirmed at the costs of the appellant.</p>
