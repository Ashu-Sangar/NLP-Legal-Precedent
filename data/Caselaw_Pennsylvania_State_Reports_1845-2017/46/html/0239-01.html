Pending the suit the plaintiff died, and J. P. Wylie, his executor, was substituted. The parties to the action were brothers. On the 9th day of April 1836 they entered into articles of agreement, in which Walker stipulated to pay John the sum of' $325, being the price of land purchased by Walker from John. The lands of the parties, although separated by lines, being contiguous, were worked in common, the parties with their mother and sister living together, in Walker’s house, and on the place. November 29th 1853, John and Walker entered into a written agreement of settlement for John’s share of the produce, which had been applied to the building of some houses on Walker’s.land, the balance being struck. Some $&gt;40Q on account were paid by Walker and receipted for to John. The evidence showed that Walker generally transacted the business, bought, sold, superintended work and worked on the farm, paid taxes, &amp;e., and also that Walker paid debts for John since the date of the agreement on which suit was brought.</p>

Is the evidence, upon which they have thus found, sufficient to repel .the presumption of payment, and to justify their finding ? It is clear that if the debt had been barred by the Statute of Limitations, the evidence would not be sufficient to take it out of the statute. The admission that the debt had not been paid, so far from being consistent with a promise to pay, was accompanied with the positive declaration of the defendant that he did not intend to pay it. If, as defendant’s counsel contends, it requires the same evidence to repel the presumption of payment as to remove the bar of the statute, then the evidence is clearly insufficient to repel the presumption. But does it require the same evidence in the one case as in the other ? The statute operates as a flat bar, and therefore the debt is not revived, unless there <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>is a new promise, express or implied, to pay it. But the presumption of payment does not operate as a positive legal bar, and may be removed by proof that the debt has not, in point of fact, been paid. It is not necessary that the debt should be revived by a new promise, it is sufficient if the presumption of payment is removed. The legal presumption is repelled if the evidence establishes the existence and non-payment of the debt: Stout <em>v. </em>Levan, 3 Barr 235; Eby <em>v. </em>Eby’s Assignee, 5 Id. 435; Morrison <em>v. </em>Funk, 11 Harris 421; MeQuesney <em>v. </em>Heister, 9 Casey 435; King’s Executor <em>v. </em>Coulter’s Executor, <a href="/grant/2/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Grant 77" data-case-ids="227455" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0077-01">2 Grant 77</a>; but the bar of the statute is not removed unless there be super-added the proof of a new promise, express or implied, to pay the debt: Fries <em>v. </em>Boisselet, 9 S. &amp; R. 128 ; Kyle <em>v. </em>Wells, 5 Harris 286 ; Huff <em>v. </em>Richardson, 7 <a href="/grant/2/0077-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Grant 77" data-case-ids="227455" data-case-paths="/grant/2/0077-01">Id.</a> 388 ; Sutler <em>v. </em>Sheeler, 10 Id. 808; Spitler <em>v. </em>Bremer, 11 Id. 413; Webster’s Executors <em>v. </em>Newbold, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20492" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Wright 492">5 Wright 492</a>.</p>

If the defendant in 1841, and again in 1851, admitted that the debt had not been paid, were not these admissions, against his interest, sufficient to produce moral conviction of the fact in the minds of reasonable men ? And does it detract from their force and weight that the defendant, at the same time, declared it to be his intention not to pay the debt ? Does it not rather add a greater efficacy to their force and power to produce conviction, than they would otherwise have had ? There can be no doubt that the evidence in this case, if believed by the jury, was sufficient to repel the presumption of payment. Upon evidence given by the defendant in MeQuesney <em>v. </em>Heister, similar in some respects to that given by the plaintiff in this case, where twenty-eight years of ground-rent were sought to be recovered, the court ruled as matter of law, without submitting the question to the jury, that the great lapse of time was accounted for, and that no legal presumption of payment arose. Here the jury have found, notwithstanding the lapse of more than twenty years from the matui’ity of the debt, that it has not been paid, and, as the authorities clearly show, upon evidence sufficient to repel the presumption of payment. Let judgment be entered on the reserved question in favour of the plaintiff for the amount found by the jury, on payment of the verdict fee.”</p>

The latter is a prohibition of the action, the former, <em>'primá facie, </em>obliterates the debt. The bar is removed by nothing less than a new promise to pay, or an acknowledgment consistent with such a promise. The presumption is rebutted, or, to speak more accurately, does not arise where there is affirmative proof beyond that furnished by the specialty itself, that the debt has not been paid, or where there are circumstances that sufficiently account for the delay of the creditor. The statutory bar is not removed without a new promise, or its equivalent, because suit on the old contract is prohibited, and the debtor can only be liable, therefore, on the contract expressly made by the new promise, or implied from an acknowledgment of continued indebtedness, the old debt being the consideration for the new engagement. This is the logic of the matter, though it is true the pleadings have not been moulded accordingly. We still declare on the old debt, and give the new promise in evidence; but notwithstanding this / incongruity, the liability which the law enforces arises out of the new contract. This view of the subject is clearly drawn by Chief Justice Gibson, in the case of .Fritz <em>v. </em>Thomas, <a href="/whart/1/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Whart. 66" data-case-ids="1829021" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0066-01">1 Whart. 66</a>. Nobody doubts that the creditor might count on the new promise, setting forth the old debt as its consideration, as is done to recover a debt discharged by a decree in bankruptcy, but which the debtor has subsequently promised to pay. Logically he should do sov But in ease of a bond or other specialty, suit-can be brought only upon the instrument of original indebtedness. The liability of the debtor does not grow out of a new promise or acknowledgment, and of course a new promise is not needed. The Statute of Limitations is a bar, whether the debt is paid or not. Not so where suit is brought on a sealed instrument. The fact of indebtedness is then in controversy, and the legal presumption of payment from lapse of time is nothing more than a transfer of the onus of proof from the debtor to the creditor. Within twenty years the law presumes the debt has remained unpaid, and throws the burden of proving payment upon the debtor. After twenty years the creditor is bound to show, by something more than his bond, that the debt has not been paid, and this he may do, because the presumption raises <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>only a <em>primd facie </em>case against him. It must be borne in mind that the presumption from lapse of time is not that there is no contract existing between the parties. If it were, proof of a new contract might be necessary. It is only an inference that the debtor has done something to discharge the debt, to wit, that he has made payment. Hence it is rebutted by simple proof that payment has not been made. And the facts being established, whether they are sufficient to rebut it, is a question for the court, and not the jury. The presumption is one drawn by the law itself from a given state of facts, and whether it exists or not, is necessarily for the court. If authority is needed for so plain a proposition, it may be found in Delany <em>v. </em>Robinson, <a href="/whart/2/0503-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Whart. 503" data-case-ids="1830485" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0503-01">2 Whart. 503</a>, where it was squarely so decided.</p>
    <p id="b243-6" data-blocks='[["BL_243.6",243,[217,939,1170,734]]]'>The case in hand was ruled in accordance with these principles, and no error was committed. The defendant in 1841 and 1851 (both within twenty years) admitted distinctly that the debt had not .been paid. It would be absurd for the law to presume in the face of such admissions that it had been. All presumptions are in accordance with what is usual, not against it. True, the defendant added to his admissions the expression of a purpose not to pay, giving as a reason not that he had paid, but that the plaintiff had obtained more than he had under the will of their common father. This might be important, if it was necessary to show that a new obligation had been assumed, but it only strengthens, if possible, the evidence that the debt remained unpaid. In Stout <em>v. </em>Levan, 3 Barr 235, where the defendants sought shelter under this presumption, it was proved he had admitted the bond was not paid, but at the same time said he had a defence to it. This wTas held sufficient to remove the' presumption. That case is directly against the plaintiff in error.</p>
