For example, when an estate for years and a remainder for life are limited to the same person by the same deed, the term will be swallowed up in the freehold, and the whole estate of the grantee cease immediately upon his death, contrary to the plain object of the grant, which was that his interest should survive to his executors, if he died before the expiration of the term. In like manner, where a rent issuing out of land, and the land out of which it issues meet in -the same hand, the rent will cease whether the purpose is that it should be extinguished or kept alive: Bacon’s Abr., vol. 3, p. 102, title <em>Extinguishment. </em>The rule on these points is ordinarily the same in equity as at law, because equity will, equally with the law, presume that men intend to produce the results which flow directly and legally from their actions, and refuse to permit the terms of the deeds or other assurances by which estates are conveyed, to be varied by parol and extrinsic evidence, that something else was meant than those terms import.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b442-7" data-blocks='[["BL_442.7",442,[305,1626,1165,773]],["BL_443.1",443,[176,380,1168,207]]]'>“ On applying these principles to the facts in evidence, it becomes plain that as the estate in the land and that in the rent were only kept apart by the outstanding legal title of the mortgagee, but rendered different in kind, no merger could take place at law, and equally so that there is nothing in the case to render estates separate at law, one in equity. Equitable merger is always founded on intention, either actual or presumed from what would have been most beneficial to the party himself,' or some one whose rights he was bound to respect and preserve; and here inference and proof both concur to show that the intention was and might properly be, to keep the land and rent as separate as if both had belonged to different persons. That Tucker neither meant to produce a merger, in the first instance, nor supposed subsequently that one had occurred, is shown by the deed from him to Curren of June 9th 1855, in which the rent was conveyed as a subsisting estate, not in anywise extinguished or drowned in the land; and it is equally plain, that while he could not have been benefited, he might easily have been prejudiced by a result <a id="p443" href="#p443" data-label="443" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*443</a>which would have enlarged the fee for the benefit of mortgagee, and enabled him to sweep away the whole of that which had previously been only within his reach in part, by proceeding to judgment and execution on the mortgage, and selling the land free from the burden of the rent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b443-6" data-blocks='[["BL_443.6",443,[179,595,1166,476]]]'>“ This argument applies with still more force to the subsequent possession of Curren, who evinced his wish that the rent and the land should remain distinct, by having them conveyed to him severally by separate deeds, and could only have lost by the extinguishment of the unencumbered title to the rent, in the encumbered title to the land. If the mortgage had originally been made or subsequently assumed by Tucker, the case might have been different, because every man is, in the contemplation of the law, interested in paying his debts, or augmenting the security for their payment ; but this cannot be said of a charge imposed on land by a third person, and which the owner is under no obligation to pay.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b443-7" data-blocks='[["BL_443.7",443,[182,1072,1166,1068]]]'>“We are therefore clearly of opinion, that the estates in question remained distinct not only while both were held by Tucker, but after they had been conveyed by him to Curren, and down to the period at which they were separated by the sale of the land and its purchase by the defendant; and this is necessarily decisive of the whole question, because the case is not one in which the state of things could be varied by the intervention of a purchaser, or his rights rise higher than those of the party whose estate he bought. All the circumstances tending to prevent a merger, and keep the land and rent apart; the legal title to the land was outstanding in the hands of the mortgagee; that the mortgage had been executed by a third person, and that it was consequently the interest of the party in whom both the rent and the land are alleged to have been united, to keep them separate, were upon or deducible from the record, and as open to every one who thought fit to make them the subject of investigation, as they are to the court. If, therefore, notice had been necessary to complete the plaintiff’s title, and bind the conscience of the defendant, there would probably have been enough to constitute notice here. But the case does not require the aid of this consideration, because the right in virtue of which the plaintiff sues, instead of being gone at law, and subsisting only in equity, is, as we have seen, equally good in both jurisdictions, and consequently binding on third persons, whether they were or were not. aware of its existence.</p>

Remainder-men need not be joined in a suit brought for the recovery of rent by the tenant for life, because the cause of action is vested exclusively in him, and does not in anywise touch or affect their interest.</p>

In like manner a purchaser of one or more of the lots or fields of a farm or tract which has been leased for life or years, can hardly, as it would seem, be entitled to a separate action for the rent against the lessee, because there would, under these circumstances, be no means of apportioning the rent, and determining how much was due to the plaintiff, and how much to the party from whom he purchased. But the objection does not arise when the plaintiff has, as in the present instance, an <em>aliquot </em>or other definite divided or undivided interest, and where there is consequently no difficulty in ascertaining his proportion of the rent for which he sues. The joinder of parties who may be dead, absent, or discordant, is often attended with inconvenience, and should not be made obligatory unless some greater inconvenience will arise if they are not joined. We are therefore of opinion, that the failure to unite the other owners of the ground-rent is not a bar to the maintenance of this suit, and give judgment for the plaintiff on both the points reserved.”</p>

Indeed, in equity, merger is never allowed unless to promote the intention, either averred or presumed, of the party. In this case the cir<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>cumstances necessary to work a merger <em>at law </em>did not exist when the title to the ground-rent and the title to the land, out of which the rent issued, became vested in John Tucker. Nor did they exist, when both the land and the rent were subsequently conveyed to Martin Ourren. There was an intervening mortgage upon the land. Technically, neither Tucker nor Ourren held anything more than the ground-rent and the equity of redemption of the land, severed by an outstanding legal mortgage. At law, then, the estate in the ground-rent and the estate in the land were always separate, and the case supplies no evidence of any intention that the one should be drowned in the other. When Tucker conveyed the rent to Curren, he conveyed it as an existing estate, not lost in the OAvnership of the land. The grant as well as the purchase, indicated an intention to preserve the tAvo interests distinct. Else Avhy a deed for the land and another for the rent ? The latter was superfluous if it AAras supposed that the rent had merged, or if it Avas intended that it should merge. And it Avas manifestly against the interest both of Tucker and Curren, that any merger should take place. The debt due the mortgagee was not the debt of either of them. It was not secured upon the rent. Yet if the rent was lost in the fee of the land, the unencumbered estate was subjected, equally Avith the estate in the land, to the mortgage. This was so manifestly against the interest both of Tucker and Curren, that equity will not enforce it, and especially when demanded by the holder of the intervening mortgage, or one claiming under the holder. The mortgagee took as security nothing more than the land, subject to the ground-rent. We are of opinion, therefore, that the District Court ruled correctly that the ground-rent had not merged.</p>

Under the statute 32 Henry 8, ch. 34, an assignee of part of the reversion may sue separately on all covenants running with the land AA'hich were made with the reversioner: 1 Chit. Plead. 116, 117. Where the rent assigned is an <em>aliquot </em>part, as in this ca.se, there is no injustice to the tenant in permitting the holder of the part to maintain his action on the covenant to pay it, and there may be great injustice in denying him this right.
