Towboats take two or three with perfect ease. The barge system is taking the place of the hand system to Cincinnati and Louisville.”'</p>
    <p id="b127-7" data-blocks='[["BL_127.7",127,[180,1111,1164,335]]]'>It is clear, therefore, from the evidence, that the risk is only at a particular stage of the water, and the instances of loss are very few, within the periods which have been accurately noted, and probably arising from the negligence or inefficiency of the pilot and crew in most cases. Tow-boats or tug-boats pass and repass without difficulty, and if used in towing coal-boats at the difficult stages of the water, would preclude all danger of loss whatever.</p>
    <p id="b127-8" data-blocks='[["BL_127.8",127,[180,1456,1163,678]]]'>In this state of the case, it is clear that neither the bridge nor any of its piers can be considered or treated as a public nuisance, and that no recovery, for any injury by an individual, can be grounded upon the allegation, that what is in the eye of the law a public nuisance, has inflicted upon him a special injury. It is equally clear, that at the time of its erection, all the piers were placed in the most proper positions, having regard to the natural course of the river, and its known mode of navigation. That the piers and abutments were placed and repaired with the full knowledge and approbation of the executive and legislative authorities of the state, the Commonwealth being a large stockholder, and that when the superstructure was destroyed by the great fire of 1845, the piers were raised in height, and the present improved road-way was built at great expense, without a single word of remonstrance from those interested in the navigation of the river.</p>

    <p id="b128-6" data-blocks='[["BL_128.6",128,[286,471,1164,512]]]'>But not pursuing further this train of investigation, it is perfectly clear that neither the bridge nor the pier upon which the plaintiff’s coal-barge struck, was a nuisance, unless such a character belongs to them in consequence of the proviso in the defendants’ charter. Without that proviso, the bridge was authorized by law, and its builders and owners were not therefore punishable in damages for its erection. The liability of the defendants is supposed to arise from the fact that their act of incorporation declares that nothing therein contained shall authorize the company to erect the bridge “ in such manner as to injure, stop, or interrupt the navigation of the said river by boats, rafts, or other vessels.”</p>
    <p id="b128-7" data-blocks='[["BL_128.7",128,[284,985,1161,687]]]'>In this proviso there is no stipulation for compensation to any one who may be injured by the exercise of the franchise, nor does it purport to be such. The defendants had not the privilege of injuring, stopping, or interrupting the navigation, on condition that they should pay all private damages. It was only a limitation of the franchise, and not a designation of the price to be paid for it. They were empowered to build such a bridge as should not injure, stop, or interrupt the navigation, and none other. If the bridge does, in the sense of the proviso, injure the navigation, then it is without authority of law, and is of course liable to abatement. We must therefore reject the idea that the proviso may be treated as a rule of liability to injured navigators, and regard it, as it was evidently intended, only as a limitation of the general terms of the grant. Undoubtedly the franchise conferred, could only be exercised in accordance with the restriction accompanying it.</p>
    <p id="b128-8" data-blocks='[["BL_128.8",128,[279,1667,1165,733]],["BL_129.1",129,[184,421,1165,290]]]'>What, then, is the meaning of this restriction ? How was it understood by the contracting parties ? When the charter was framed, a bridge at this point without piers was impossible, and the very language of the several Acts of Assembly relating to it, proves that the legislature contemplated the erection of piers as a necessary and indispensable part of the bridge. Yet piers in the bed of a navigable stream inevitably endanger navigation, and render it more difficult. This is eminently true of such a stream as the Monongahela, which, at times, is navigable over its entire bed. The proviso then was not understood, nor intended to prevent the erection of piers in the bed of the river. They do not necessarily “injure, stop, or interrupt the navigation,” in the sense in which these words were used by the legislature. A strict, literal meaning was not intended, and in the very nature of things, it never could have been. To hold otherwise, would be to make the proviso repugnant to the grant. It would be to make it prohibit the construction of a pier, which <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>the body of the act of incorporation clearly and distinctly authorized. Such an interpretation of the legislative language is not to be admitted. If such an effect be given to the proviso, we are unable to perceive how any bridge could have been erected, and why that which has been built must not be abated, even though the Commonwealth aided in its erection, and sanctioned its being rebuilt.</p>
    <p id="b129-6" data-blocks='[["BL_129.6",129,[185,720,1166,301]]]'>• But that the legislature intended a bridge should be built and maintained, with piers supporting the road-way, and that they therefore do authorize some interference with the navigation, admits of no question. To carry out their design, and to construe the charter as it was understood by the parties, demands, therefore, that no such meaning be attributed to the proviso as will defeat the grant.</p>
    <p id="b129-7" data-blocks='[["BL_129.7",129,[188,1021,1164,719]]]'>The general rule undoubtedly is, that charters of incorporation of private companies are to be construed strictly in favour of the Commonwealth — so are grants to natural persons — but they are to be construed reasonably. It is very clear that, when the purpose of the franchise is the performance of a public act, the grant is to be interpreted so as' to enable the act to be done. The act for which provision was made in this charter was a public one. It was the extension of one highway over another; nor was the erection of the bridge less the performance of a public function, because the agent was empowered to exact tolls from passengers. The legislature is not to be supposed to have authorized and prohibited such a public act, at the same time and by the same charter, a grant of power to erect a public bridge, is not to be construed so as to make its erection impossible, and such a construction justified by the rule that private charters are to be strictly interpreted. That would be highly unreasonable.</p>
    <p id="b129-8" data-blocks='[["BL_129.8",129,[187,1750,1166,599]]]'>The case of Bacon <em>v. </em>Arthur, <a href="/watts/4/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Watts 437" data-case-ids="1842735" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0437-01">4 Watts 437</a>, is supposed by the defendant in error to have some bearing on this case, but it has none whatever. There, the meaning of the Mill-dam Act of 1803 was brought in question. That was an act granting private privileges in public highways. It expressly provides, that any person who may be obstructed, or suffer damage, or may be delayed, may recover damages from the owner of the dam. It left also to the builder of the dam to determine where he would erect it. The grant under that act is a mere license — the concession of a private privilege — not of the right to perform a public act, and the action was brought to recover compensation for an injury caused not by the dam itself, but by a bar occasioned by the dam, and which might have been removed without any interference with the structure of the dam.</p>
    <p id="b129-9" data-blocks='[["BL_129.9",129,[181,2349,1170,86]],["BL_130.1",130,[295,406,1162,607]]]'>In all these respects, the case of Bacon <em>v. </em>Arthur is unlike the present. Here the charter — the Act of Assembly to be con<a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>strued — is a grant of power to exercise a <em>public </em>right beneficial to the whole community. The legislature located the bridge, and in fact determined that it should be built with piers. The charter made no express provision that compensation should be made for consequential injuries to individuals, and here the gravamen of the complaint is, that the pier was wrongly allowed to remain in the channel of the river. The action therefore strikes at the bridge itself. Such a charter is not to be construed as the grant of a private privilege. This is not the interference of a private right with a public right. Even in Bacon <em>v. </em>Arthur, some liberality of construction was adopted, much more should it be in a case where provision is made that one highway may interfere with another, as must always be the case where one highway crosses another.</p>
    <p id="b130-6" data-blocks='[["BL_130.6",130,[296,1008,1172,1116]]]'>It must be held, then, that the pier complained of is not unlawful on account of the proviso, even though it may, to some extent, interfere with the navigation of the river, and if not unlawful, it is not a nuisance. And it would seem that damages cannot be recovered for losses resulting from its location, for it is an established principle, that a corporation invested with a franchise to do a public act, “ is liable for consequential damages no further than it is declared to be in the act of its incorporation.” It is the <em>locum tenens </em>of the state, and is clothed with the state’s immunities. This was held in Coon <em>v. </em>The Monongahela Navigation Company, 6 Barr 382, and so it has often been ruled since. Now that the state might have obstructed, abridged, or interfered with the navigation of the river; that it might have constructed a highway over it with supporting piers, without any liability to navigators, was satisfactorily shown by Woodward, J., in The Board of Wardens of the Port of Philadelphia <em>v. </em>The City of Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20209" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Wright 209">6 Wright 209</a>, and surely it cannot be maintained that the proviso in the company’s charter is a declaration that they shall pay damages to any one injured. It is clear, therefore, that the defendants are not liable in this action, unless the bridge be an unauthorized erection, and consequently a nuisance. That it is not, has been sufficiently shown. If the piers were authorized, but injudiciously located, the Commonwealth may complain, but the plaintiff cannot avail himself of it in this action, as was held in Clarke <em>v. </em>The Birmingham and Pittsburgh Bridge Company, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20147" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Wright 147">5 Wright 147</a>.</p>

It is therefore unnecessary <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>to examine in detail, the errors assigned, for we are of opinion that, whether the plaintiff’s boats were carefully and skilfully navigated or not, he is not entitled to recover.</p>
