On the same day Myers &amp; Shour assigned their stock to George Hoffman and others as collateral security for certain liabilities to the bank. Notice of this assignment rvas given to the bank on the 25th of- May. The bank having-sued Klopp &amp; Stump as drawers of the note to Myers &amp; Shour, Klopp &amp; Stump paid the judgment on the 1st of July 1860, before and after the payment claiming a transfer of the stock as sureties in the note for Myers <em>&amp; </em>Shour. On the 26th of July, they also gave a written notice to the bank of their right to the stock as accommodation drawers for Myers &amp; Shour.</p>
    <p id="b93-7" data-blocks='[["BL_93.9",93,[189,1035,1168,303]]]'>The learned judge of the Common Pleas, in deciding against the right of the complainants to subrogation to the lien of the bank upon the stock, put aside the question whether the note was due and unpaid on the 24th of May to the bank, so as to entitle it to a lien upon the stock under the Act of Assembly; and considered the question as resting solely between Klopp <em>&amp; </em>Stump and Hoffman and others, the assignees of the stock.</p>
    <p id="b93-8" data-blocks='[["BL_93.10",93,[186,1337,1169,687]]]'>In this we think there was error. If the case depended entirely upon a comparison of right, either in privity or equity, between the sureties of an unpaid note, who had not yet become creditors by paying it, and a claimant of the stock by actual assignment, the case would be at an end, the sureties having no title to the stock either in law or equity. It is only by the title of the bank that the stock can be held at all against the assignment. If that fail, the right to subrogation fails with it. The question is therefore directly between the title of the bank under its lien, and that of the assignees under the assignment. If the bank have title by lien, then the assignment gives way because of a better legal title, and it-is this legal title the sureties claim. The claim to have this title lies in equity, but the title itself rests in law, so that if entitled to possess the lien, their right to the stock itself is by a legal and better title than that of the assignees.</p>

The 24th was the third and last day of grace. It entitled the bank to demand payment and receive the money, and also to protest for non-payment. It is immaterial whether suit can be maintained upon the third day after demand and protest or not. There may be reasons in favour of the drawer to allow him still further grace in order to avoid litigation, but certainly none to justify such an injurious interpretation of the Act of Assembly securing the lien as would <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>enable the drawer or endorser, after demand and protest for nonpayment, to assign his stock and defeat the lien on the ground that the paper was not ripe for suit until the following day.</p>
    <p id="ApN" data-blocks='[["BL_94.6",94,[271,526,1168,728]]]'>The note is <em>actually due </em>so far as the right to payment is involved, else there could be no right to demand and receive payment on that day. As to the right to receive the money, clearly the right to demand it is the test. And the note is <em>actually unpaid </em>if on demand the drawer refuses to pay, or, what is equivalent, provides no funds at the place of payment. If it were otherwise, where is the right to protest for non-payment on that day ? and the law is that the protest must be made or at least noted on the last day of grace. The protest in its very terms is a declaration against the drawer, reciting the demand, that the time limited for payment has fully expired, and solemnly protesting against the drawer for all exchanges, costs, and damages suifered by reason of the non-payment. A notarial protest is not absolutely necessary, the holder having himself the right to demand payment and notify the endorsers of the failure; but its nature and terms prove most clearly that the paper is actually unpaid.</p>
    <p id="b94-7" data-blocks='[["BL_94.7",94,[261,1254,1176,721]]]'>The bank therefore having the right to demand and receive the money from the drawer and to protest for non-payment, certainly the failure had happened which it was the intention of the law to provide for, and consequently the lien had 'commenced. The lien therefore attached on the 24th of May. This being so, when the assignees came on the 25th to demand a transfer they were met by the prior lien as a legal and better claim to the stock. This is by the express terms of the law which operates upon the transfer as well as the assignment. The following is the provision: “ The stock of the bank shall be <em>assignable </em>and <em>transferable </em>on the <em>books </em>of the corporation <em>only, </em>and in the presence of the president or cashier, in such manner as the by-laws shall ordain; but no stockholder indebted to a bank for a debt actually due and unpaid shall be authorized to make a <em>transfer </em>or receive a dividend, until such debt is discharged or security to the satisfaction of the directors given for the same.”</p>

The lien of the bank having attached before notice of assignment and claim of transfer, it is clear that when the claim was made on the 25th of May, it had a right to refuse to make the transfer, and to hold the stock upon the debt. It is equally clear 'that the rights of the sureties in the note had also taken precedence of the assignment, for the moment the lien began, the duty of the bank also began, to hold the security of the stock for the benefit of <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>the sureties. It is this security as the bank held it, and not less than it held it, to which equity subrogated the sureties on their payment of the debt. The debt is the object of the lien and for which it is the security, and it is this security that equity lays hold of, for the benefit of the sureties. But the title to it was in the bank until payment.</p>
    <p id="b95-5" data-blocks='[["BL_95.6",95,[202,656,1168,518]]]'>It is for this reason that the want of .notice to the bank does not take away the sureties’ right to subrogation. It is not the notice which creates the equity, but the fact of suretyship coupled with the payment. Until payment, the bank held for itself, and payment only consummated the title of the surety to demand subrogation. The benevolence which dictates the subrogation inheres in the relation of the parties, not the knowledge. It is true as between the bank and the sureties, want of notice might prevent subrogation, if the bank had permitted a transfer. But this would be on the ground of laches ór a want of diligence which prevents the administration of the equity, not because the equity had not arisen.</p>
    <p id="b95-6" data-blocks='[["BL_95.7",95,[203,1174,1168,203]]]'>In this case, no new relation having sprung up, and the bank having suffered no prejudice, and the sureties having claimed the transfer at the time of payment, there is nothing to prevent the administration of equity.
