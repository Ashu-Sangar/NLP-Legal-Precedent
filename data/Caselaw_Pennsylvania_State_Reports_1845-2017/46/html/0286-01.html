The government collector requires payment of this duty or tax, or a bond in lieu of payment, before a permit is granted for the removal of the oil. The Act of Congress, entitled “ An act to provide internal revenue to support the government,” &amp;e., §'47, provides that “ oil may be removed for the purpose of being exported (after inspection) according to the provisions of this act, upon and with the written permission of the collector or deputy collector of the district, without payment of the duties thereon previous to such removal, the owner thereof having first given bond to the United States, with sufficient sureties, in the manner and form and under regulations prescribed by the commissioner of internal revenue, and in at least double the amount of said duties, to export the said spirits or oil, or pay the duties thereon within such time,” &amp;c.</p>

The contract of the parties must be construed as being made with reference to the law; and neither party should be visited with damages for observing the requirements of the law. The plaintiff below purchased the oil in bond and for export; therefore he was bound not only to pay the agreed price for the oil, but also to make oath before the collector of the district and obtain a permit for the removal of the oil for exportation, and give a satisfactory bond to the United States, conditioned that he -would export it within a given time, or pay the duty or tax of ten cents per gallon. The plaintiff having failed to prove any of these matters, the court should have charged the jury as requested in the defendants’ third point. If Tyson was the purchaser or owner of the oil, he purchased it subject to the provisions of the Interna] Revenue Law, and he was not entitled to have it removed or shipped until after compliance with the terms of that law.</p>

The most that could be educed from the evidence, as constituting the plaintiff’s case, was this: that he purchased one hundred barrels of oil at 35 cents per gallon, in bond for exportation, deliverable within a few days, or when the defendants would “have time” to deliver it, after the 7th of November 1862; and that oil continued to rise in price or value from that date until it had reached about 50 or 55 cents on the 17th of November. Suit was brought on the 28th of the same month. Upon this evidence the plaintiff claimed damages corresponding to the increased price of oil, and, under the ruling of the court, obtained a verdict for $600.

If Tyson told Robison, Hill &amp; Co. that he intended the oil for exportation, and they sold to him under that belief, <em>i. e., </em>they had a right to consider themselves the exporters of the oil, so far as the question of oath was and could make it. <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>It is at best a mere formal declaration of purpose to export, intended probably to protect the collectors in oil districts from being harassed with giving permits to and taking bond from men who, seeking merely to take advantage of some other home market, would avail themselves, if they had not to make oath of a probable intention to export, of that method of getting their oil to the desired market. The bond is the real security which government looks to, and the manner in which it is drawn, <em>i. e., </em>providing for the payment of <em>the </em>duties on the oil, in case <em>it is </em>not exported (after the person giving the bond has sworn that he intended exporting), shows that the oath is not regarded as in itself essential. Were it so, the bond which immediately follows it would hardly provide for the contingency of non-exportation, the happening of which, the oath (if the plaintiffs’ in error view of its binding force and strictness be taken), absolutely and positively forbids.</p>

By the terms of this contract the oil was to be delivered on board the Pennsylvania Railroad cars at Pittsburgh. Up to the time of said delivery Robison, Hill &amp; Co. were the absolute owners of the oil; at and after the delivery on board the cars Tyson was the owner. But the delivery (which would divest the title of Robison, Hill &amp; Co.) involved the removal of the oil from the premises where distilled, whether from the distillery of Robison, Hill &amp; Co., or that of any other distiller, and before that could be done a bond must be given, or the tax be paid. We agree with the plaintiffs in error “ that the contract must be construed as having been made with reference to the law,” and therefore the parties not having, as the evidence shows, specially provided as between themselves for the giving of the bond, and it being a condition precedent, and one which must be performed by some person before the terms of the contract could be complied with by Robison, Hill &amp; Co., and the excise law allowing them, if owners, to give bonds, and they actually being the owners of the oil, it became a part of their contract either to bond the oil or pay the tax — in a word, to do everything that would enable them to deliver the oil as per terms of contract. Tyson’s duty was a simple one, viz., to accept a delivery of the oil on the cars, and pay for it when delivered or tendered. Robison, Hill &amp; Co.’s duty was to deliver the oil, and that duty carried along with it a performance of all the essentials that pertain to a valid, legal delivery. Their present duty <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>on this point (it being decided that they had power under the Excise Law to furnish the bond), differs in no respect from that of a vendor who has covenanted to deliver a deed for land sold, and who has made no special arrangements with his vendee in reference to his, the vendee’s, paying for the stamp on the deed. In that case, furnishing the stamp, which perfects the deed and adds to a valid 'delivery, becom.es a part of the vendor’s contract, just as in this instance furnishing a bond which would promote a delivery of the oil, becomes a part of the contract of Robison, Hill &amp; Co.</p>

Had Robison, Hill &amp; Co. sent this oil, it would have been an easy matter to have proven the fact. By the terms of this contract the oil was deliverable on board the cars free of charge at 35 cents per gallon, and $1.50 per barrel. Therefore a delivery, or offer of delivery, must take place before a tender of the price could be claimed, or insisted upon. There was no injustice done defendants below, on the amount of damages allowed, which were given as of the prices ruling from November 15th to 17th. It was proven that Robison said, on November 8th, they would deliver the oil in two or three days, when the funeral of his clerk’s brother was over, and a reasonable time over and above that (three or four days) was properly given Tyson, in which, after learning by the non-delivery of the oil and otherwise of the breach of the contract, to come out from Philadelphia and make his purchase over again.</p>

It is obvious that an affirmance of .the points could not be justified by anything .less than the fact that the declaration set out no cause of action, or that proof was totally wanting to sustain some one or more of its material averments. It alleged a contract of the defendants to deliver to the plaintiff, on board the Pennsylvania Railroad Company’s cars, within a reasonable time, one hundred barrels of oil, of a given description, for which the plaintiff agreed to pay a stipulated price. It further averred a neglect and refusal of the defendants to deliver the oil within a reasonable time, and that the plaintiff had always been ready and willing to receive it, and pay for it as provided in the contract. The uncontradicted evidence proves that on the 6th da.y of November 1862, such a contract was made between the parties ; that on the next day following, they met to arrange for the delivery and reception' of the oil, and that it was then agreed the delivery should be made within two or three days, or as soon as the funeral of a person then deceased was over, and the defendants had time. It was, however, never delivered, and this suit was brought on the 28th of November 1862. That the declaration set out a sufficient cause of action is plain, unless it was defective in not averring a demand had been made for delivery. There was proof, however, of what dispensed with the necessity of a demand, namely, that the parties fixed a time for the delivery. It may be, this should have been averred in the declaration, but the absence of such an averment is no sufficient reason for reversing the judgment. An amendment would have been of course, had it been asked. But -it is objected there was no averment or proof of tender of the price. It was not necessary. There was an allegation of readiness to receive the oil and pay for it, and no more is required in the pleadings in such a case. Thus it is ruled in Waterhouse <em>v. </em>Skinner, 2 Bos. &amp; Pul. 447, that in an action for the non-delivery of goods, the plaintiff need only aver that he was ready and willing to receive and pay for them, and a refusal to deliver, without averring an actual tender. To the same effect is Rawson <em>v. </em>Johnson, 1 East 203, and the doctrine is repeated in Bronson <em>v. </em>Wyman, 4 Seld. 182. Indeed, where, by the terms of the contract, the delivery and payment of the price are to be made, not at the vendor’s place of business, but at some' other place, there can be no actual tender, if the vendor refuses to deliver the goods. And if a tender need not be averred, it need not be proved.</p>

The averment con<a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>tained in the declaration, that the plaintiff was ready and willing to receive the oil, and pay for it on its delivery and shipment in the cars, was a material one, and was necessary to he proved. In Rawson <em>v. </em>Johnson, 1 East, already cited, the plaintiffs averred a readiness to accept and pay for the malt the defendants had engaged to deliver. This was held sufficient without stating a tender, but Lord Kenyon said that under the averment as made, “ the plaintiffs must have proved they were prepared to tender and pay the money, if the defendant had been ready to receive it, and to deliver the goods.” In Porter <em>v. </em>Rose, <a href="/johns/12/0209-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 Johns. 209" data-case-ids="2139253" data-case-paths="/johns/12/0209-01">12 Johns. 209</a>, it is decided that the averment of a readiness to pay, like other material averments, must be proved on the trial. Topping <em>v. </em>Root, 5 Cowen 404, decides the same. So does Ooonley <em>v. </em>Anderson, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Hill%20522" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Hill 522">1 Hill 522</a>. And such is the'universally recognised doctrine. It is not said there must be direct proof that the vendee was present at the time and place appointed for the delivery, with the money in hand with which to make payment, but there must be evidence from which a jury may legitimately infer that he was then and there ready. The reasonableness of the rule is well illustrated in the present case.</p>

It does not appear that he was himself, or that he had any agent, at the cars at the time fixed for the delivery. But the instant the oil was in the cars at Pittsburgh, the defendants had a right to their money. They were not bound to wait till its arrival at Philadelphia, or whatever place might have been its point of destination. Until they received the price, they might retain possession. And the plaintiff’s readiness to receive the oil, and to pay if he was ready, was a positive fact within his knowledge, and capable of being proved by him. To prove it, however, he made no attempt, and so far as any evidence exists in the cause, it rather tends to prove that he was not ready.
