He received on the mortgage in cash $2784, at the date of the mortgage, and assigned to the association, at the time of the loan, sixteen shares of stock as collateral security. On this stock he paid instalments of $1680. He paid also $720 as interest on the mortgage; Subsequently he executed to the Spring Garden Loan Association a bond and warrant of attorney, to secure a loan on the same real estate, subject to the first mortgage. On the 22d day of March 1861, he executed an assignment for the benefit of his creditors, to William McCleary. The premises described in the mortgage had been sold at sheriff’s sale to the Spring Garden Loan Association, subject to the first mortgage, and the sheriff executed a deed to them, bearing date and acknowledged May 17th 1862. On the 20th day of October 1862, McCleary notified the association of Conrow’s assignment to him, and that he claimed the stock assigned to them as collateral security, requiring them to collect the whole amount of the mortgage, and not to allow any deduction for Conrow’s payments on the stock. The association thereupon brought this action of <em>scire facias </em>on their mortgage, and the Spring Garden Loan Association took defence as terretenants, as above stated.</p>

Payments to stock are not <em>ipso facto </em>payment to the mortgage-debt or loan. It is true, according to former decisions, the mortgagor may apply his payments on the stock to the mortgage-debt, a license to do so being implied in the nature of these building loan transactions. The building association may also apply them by virtue of the terms of the assignment of the stock, which is taken as a collateral security. But in order to effectuate application of payments on stock to the debt, it requires an act of appropriation by one or the other of the parties. Strangers to the transaction stand upon a different footing. They can require nothing which the parties do not. Hence in this case there being no appropriation by either party, but, on the contrary, a notice by the debtor to the creditor not to apply the stock payments to the loan debt, and an acceptance and acting upon this notice by the creditor, the purchasers at sheriff’s sale of the mortgaged premises cannot compel an application of the collateral security to reduce the mortgage.</p>
