It was understood, while he was delivering the wheat, that he was preparing to go to the West. Daniel Richards came to our store; I asked him whether he knew Samuel Richards was going to the West ? He said he did. I asked him if there was no way in which he could put Samuel in possession of the William Richards farm ? He said he did not feel able to do so now without selling the homestead. I suggested how he could raise the balance; he did not seem satisfied; I proposed to do it on his paper at Williamsport ; about one thousand; he did not seem satisfied with this idea; I referred him to an attorney, to see if it could be done, wdioever his attorney might be; he came the next day; he came to town, and as he passed said if my suggestion was right he would try it; after he came back he seemed quite pleased, and said he would undertake it. Samuel Richards then went to the West, and made the purchase of the two shares of William Richards’s property from Daniel Richards’s brothers. Daniel Richards told me Samuel had $1200 or $1500 when he went West. I received a letter from Samuel Richards; I went up to Daniel Richards, and he showed me'a letter he had got to the same effect; I took -with me a blank cheek and a piece of paper; I finished a letter at Daniel Richards’s, his reply to Samuel’s letter. The balance of the purchase-money was $3300; I filled up the check (about 1st January 1856) for $3300, I dated it forward to 25th May; Daniel Richards signed the check payable to Samuel Richards; I endorsed it Hugh Devling &amp; Co. on the back; I put it in a letter and sealed it up, and directed it to Samuel Richards; a short time after, perhaps ten days, Samuel <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>Richards and Daniel Richards, and ,a gentleman by name of Smead, son-in-law of one of the Richards in Ohio, came to our place together; it appeared they could not cash the check in the West; they wanted to get $1500 in money if it could be raised ; this check was then cancelled, and there was a note made for $1500, at ninety days, drawn by Daniel Richards, payable to Samuel Richards, at Lock Haven Bank; I took the note in company with Samuel Richards, and went to Williamsport, in the expectation of getting the money. When we got there Lloyd was not at home; came back to Jersey Shore, that we might get it if Samuel failed to get it there. Came to Lock Haven, and Samuel Richards took the note, and went to Woods &amp; McFarland. We went on up to Flemington from here; Daniel Richards and Smead were there, or came there soon after; the change was made, and this note was given.</p>

The last count is also special, but it is incomplete in itself, and somewhat confused. It seems to be intended by it to bring in the will of the defendant’s testator, not so as to claim a legacy, but as an additional circumstance in proof of the promise relied on in the previous special count. But no matter how the will was introduced, it was incompetent to complete the evidence of the contract relied on. The plaintiff below understands the will as bequeathing to him a sum sufficient to pay the balance of the purchase-money due by him on the William Richards farm. If so, then he must recover it as a legacy and not as a debt, unless he can also show that it is a debt. The will does not tend to show this.</p>

But this does not make a legal contract. Assurances of assistance accompanying kind advice are never intended as contracts. And conformance to advice is never intended to stand as a legal <em>consideration </em>for the kind assurances that accompany the advice, though it is a <em>motive </em>for their fulfilment. It would be exceedflngly hurtful to the freedom of social intercourse to create even a suspicion in the public mind, that those kind offers of advice assistance, which take place among friends and kindred, ijcould be converted into contracts which the law would enforce.</p>
