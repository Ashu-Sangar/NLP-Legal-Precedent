It is still more unfortunate, that, as regards their separate estates, <em>femes covert </em>have been regarded in equity as <em>femes sole. </em>It has been justly remarked that if the principle be pushed to its extent, a married woman who has trustees, will be infinitely worse protected than if she were left to her legal rights.” In the very same year, in Fisher <em>v. </em>Taylor, <a href="/rawle/2/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="2 Rawle 33" data-case-ids="1820621" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0033-01">2 Rawle 33</a>, the court (carrying out the expressed views of the chief justice), where land was purchased by and conveyed to executors under the provisions of the testator’s will, in trust for the testator’s son, who was to have the rents, issues, and profits thereof, but the same not to be liable to any debts contracted, or which may be contracted'by his said son, and at his death the said land to vest in the heirs of the body of the said son in fee, held, that the son has not such an interest in the land as could be taken in execution and sold for his debts.</p>

The mode in which he accomplishes such a purpose, is by creating a trust estate, explicitly designating the uses, and defining the power of the trustees.

He has no life estate in it, nor any interest in it which is subject to be sold for the payment of his debts. The benefit he derives under the will of his father is merely the right of receiving from the trustees the rents and profits of the premises which they hold under the deed from John Graham and wife; to the perception of those rents and profits, they are in the first place entitled for the purpose of fulfilling their trust.”</p>

The testatrix appoints her executor to be guardian of the minor until he shall attain the age of twenty-one years, if he shall so long live; directs the guardian to lease, occupy, and improve the estates, and from the rents and profits to maintain and educate the minor. The court said: “ A present estate in fee was devised, and it was the possession only which was postponed." “ And the words of the will are sufficient to create a trust estate in the tenant (the guardian), by which he may hold the estate for the purpose for which the trust was created, until, by the will, the devisee can take possession for himself.”</p>

In re Birtlc’s Estates, 32 L. Jour. Ch. 439, the lords justices, on the 25th of May last, decided in a case like the present, that the trust estate remained in the trustees during a life or lives in being, and on the expiration of the last life, it vested in persons in fee simple, who were not ascertained until that event happened. In this case, property was by will limited to trustees during the life of the longest liver of the testator’s wife and five children, and from the death of such longest liver, to the respective issue then living of his children, in undivided fifth shares as tenants in common in fee, with cross-remainder limitations. The longest liver of testator’s wife and five children died in 1861, when the property vested absolutely in fee in undivided shares in numerous individuals. The absolute vesting was thus postponed for six lives in being at the death of the testator, and might have been carried twenty-one years further: Pownall <em>v. </em>Graham, 9 Jurist, N. S. 318.</p>
