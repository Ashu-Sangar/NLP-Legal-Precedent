If they had done so it would have relieved them from further responsibility. Not doing so, in contemplation of the contract, the goods being deliverable in parcels, as long as the vendee made no demand, it cannot be inferred the contract was broken by the vendor; but so soon as a demand was made by the vendees, and a refusal to deliver by the vendor, the contract was broken, and it is as of time of breach of contract, the damages are fixed. Non-compliance with a demand to deliver, and no proposal to comply till after suit brought, it is too late then for defendant to retrieve his position. So soon as a demand was made, and it appeared the defendant had no intention of immediate compliance, the plaintiffs had a right to regard the contract as broken, and make their arrangements accordingly.</p>

      <em>“4. </em>Negatived. They might do so, and might have supposed it was an obligement on their part not to demand compliance with the contract until the vendor found it convenient to perform. As the vendor had it in his power to perform without asking the vendee’s leave, the vendee might well suppose it was for the vendor’s convenience the delay was incurred. No demand was necessary to enable vendor to deliver, and relieve himself of the risks of fire or leakage, or a rise in prices.</p>

This, I take it, refers to the expression in • the contract — ‘ said oil to be exported,’ which means this (if it means anything), viz.: That the vendors or manufacturers having paid the internal revenue tax, or ten cents per gallon, or secured it, claimed or reserved to themselves the drawback consequent on exportation; and that it was therefore the duty of the vendee under the contract, to export the oil so as to enable the vendor or manufacturers to make out their claim to the drawback; but as to the fifteen barrels delivered, we have no evidence that it has not been exported, to make it a set-off or equitable defence here to the damages claimed for non-delivery of the residue. The defendant should show that the plaintiff has not complied with his contract in that respect, if he predicates anything upon it. And as to the twenty-five barrels not delivered, the defendants can claim nothing from the fact that it was not exported by plaintiffs. The plaintiffs bought for exportation, and whatever they could have obtained for it for exportation at the time of demand made, is the criterion by which the damages are to be governed. ■</p>

It is evident not only from the words used, but also from the fact that the agreement was not signed at all by the plaintiffs, that payment for the oil was to be a cash payment, on and concurrent with delivery. It was therefore the duty of the plaintiffs, in accordance with all the cases, in order to maintain their action, to make an offer of payment of the money when they demanded performance on the other side, and to have averred and proved that they were ready and willing to pay on delivery of the oil. This is not strictly a tender, as was said by the late Chief Justice Lewis, of this court, in Henry <em>v. </em>Raiman and Williams <em>v. </em>Bentley, but it is what the party was bound to do, in order to maintain his action, as ruled by those cases. See Waggenblast <em>v. </em>McKean, not reported.
