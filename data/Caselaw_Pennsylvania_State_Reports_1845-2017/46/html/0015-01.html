No one can doubt, we think, that here there was an actual disseisin. In such a case a co-tenant may enter upon a part of the estate, in the name of the whole, and thus be remitted to his former title by relation back to the day of his disseisin. And so far has the doctrine of the right to enter been carried, that in Butcher <em>v. </em>Butcher, 7 B. &amp; C. 399,14 E. O. L. R. 61, it was held that a party having a right to the land, acquired by entry the lawful possession of it, and may maintain trespass against any person who, being in possession of the land at the time of entry, wrongfully continues so. It is true, that in Dawson <em>v. </em>McGill, <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Whart.%20241" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="14 Whart. 241">14 Whart. 241</a>, Chief Justice Gibson seems to doubt ‘whether an entry without process would give a retrospective possession,’ and adds, ‘ could, however, a party have trespass on an actual entry pending his ejectment, it would be oppressive - to burthen him with successive actions to cover intermediate proceedings, which he might be excluded from recovering by the statute; to say nothing of the repugnance there might be betwixt success on these and subsequent defeat in the struggle for the possession.” But the repugnance is not greater than often happens in actions to recover mesne profits; as a verdict in ejectment is conclusive of the right to recover during the time defendant was in possession, although the defendant has had his title established by two verdicts, one prior and the other subsequent to the term for which the action of trespass is brought: Drexell <em>v. </em>Mann, 2 Barr 271. In a later <a id="p18" href="#p18" data-label="18" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*18</a>case, however, it is admitted that one who is entitled to possession can make an entry and maintain trespass. Mr. Justice Kennedy asserts, ‘that it is a mistake to say that possession must necessarily be acquired by means of a recovery in ejectment ; for if the plaintiff can show that he has the freehold and is entitled to the possession, he may enter without legal process of any description whatever; and having thus acquired possession, may maintain the action in the same manner and to the same extent as he could have done had he been put into the possession by reason of a recovery in ejectment. Before entry and actual possession, one cannot maintain an action of trespass, though he had the freehold in law, and therefore an heir before entry cannot have this action against an abator, though a disseisee might have it against a disseisor for the injury done by the disseisor itself, at which time the plaintiff was seised of the land; but he cannot have it for any act done after the disseisin, until he hath gained possession by re-entry, and then he may well maintain it for the <em>intermediate damage </em>done; for after his reentry, the law, by a kind of <em>jus fostliminii, </em>supposes the freehold to have all along continued in him : 3 Bl. Com. 210; 11 Co. 54; Kent’s Com. 19; Co. Lit. 257 a, 275 b ; 1 Co. 98 ; 1 Lew. 302; Tobey <em>v. </em>Webster, <a href="/johns/3/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="3 Johns. 468" data-case-ids="2129768" data-case-paths="/johns/3/0468-01">3 Johns. 468</a>; 13 East 489; Willes 329; 2 Stran. 1086 ; note E. Thos. Coke 58, 72. If the authorities just cited are not sufficient to show that the plaintiff in this action, after making such entry, and upon showing his right to the freehold and possession, could maintain his action for the mesne profits, I apprehend that a recovery in ejectment would not enable him to do so :’ Reed <em>v. </em>Stanly, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20375" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 375">6 W. &amp; S. 375</a>, 376. If this doctrine is correct, we cannot see why trespass could not be brought immediately before the bringing of an ejectment, and thus include at least six years’ time previous to the commencement of that action, if so much had elapsed, and after its termination an action of trespass for the mesne profits during the pendency of the possessory action; and thus at least save twelve years of mesne profits, six before and six after the ejectment, should the case require it. If the party should not prefer ejectment, we cannot perceive any reason why successive entries should not be made, and successive actions brought, particularly as a recovery in one action of trespass on the title, or on a plea of <em>liberum tenementum, </em>can be given in evidence as conclusive of the title between the parties and their privies in each successive action: Hughes <em>v. </em>Stevens, 7 Casey 381.</p>

This practice was in use in Pennsylvania whilst it was a province, and before <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>the secession of Delaware. There it was long in common use. In Pennsylvania in 1775, in the case of Lessee of Dixon <em>v. </em>Hosaclr, 41Z. was given in damages for mesne profits, in the trial of an ejectment. Sharp <em>v. </em>Bell, tried in 1787, was another case of the kind. In Yates <em>v. </em>Stewart, tried at Nisi Prius, at Chambersburg in 1789, a verdict was rendered for 1301 mesne profits, and upon appeal to the Supreme Court, judgment was entered upon the verdict in banc. In Boyd <em>v. </em>Cowan, tried at Westchester in 1793, a verdict was given in ejectment for 411. 14s. <em>4d. </em>On a motion for a new trial, a very able opinion was prepared by Chief Justice McKean to sustain it, but as the case was settled by the parties it was not delivered, but is reported in 4 Dali. 139. Although this practice became almost obsolete in consequence of doubts of its correctness by the profession, there is no decision adverse to it, and it has lately been sustained by our Supreme Court in several cases : Dawson <em>v. </em>McGill, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Whart.%20231" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="4 Whart. 231">4 Whart. 231</a>; Cook <em>v. </em>Nicholas, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2028" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 28">2 W. &amp; S. 28</a>; Byard <em>v. </em>Enyglis, 5 Id. 469; Lynch <em>v. </em>Cox, 11 Harris 271; Storch <em>v. </em>Carr, 4 Casey 137. But the importance of this remedy, as regards its application to the present case, is whether the Statute of Limitations can be pleaded so as to bar the recovery of mesne profits, if sought to be recovered in the ejectment for more than six years after the commencement of that action ? The Statute of Limitations applicable to ejectment, is that given by the 2d section of the Act of 26th of March 1785, which is twenty-one years. Proceeding for mesne profits in this form, it would seem incongruous that one statute shall be applied to one part of the cause of action, and another statute to another part, when both causes arise from the same act of disseisin. In California, under their practice, the plaintiff recovers the possession as well as the mesne profits, <em>‘ </em>as one cause of action Sullivan <em>v. </em>Davis, <a href="/cal/4/0291-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="4 Cal. 291" data-case-ids="4214825" data-case-paths="/cal/4/0291-01">4 Cal. Rep. 291</a>. Besides, as will be seen hereafter, where a form of action is selected, all the consequences that accompany it are adopted, and we see no reason why this proceeding should be an exception. Limitations are the creatures of statute, and must bar the action either by <em>name </em>or description, and no statute, except the one already referred to, applies to ejectment. Again, the action of ejectment, of which the present mode is a modification, came into use in the place of the ‘ <em>assise,’ </em>in which possession as well as mesne profits w'ere recoverable, and I can find no instance in which a limitation of six years was ever applied to it. In Dawson <em>v. </em>McGill, already cited, Chief Justice Gibson, speaking of this remedy, says<em>: </em>No justice is shown by the Statute of Limitations which, as is generally asserted, .... bars a recovery in trespass for ¿11 but the last six years..... If then a plaintiff who has been long baffled, may not maintain an action for mesne profits before he has recovered the possession, and if he can then <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>have damages for no more than six years, it is evident that there is a defect in the process of the law, which calls for amendment.’ In our statutory ejectment, therefore, the plaintiff must be allowed to go for the possession and the profits together; and the remaining inquiry regards the time for which he shall be permitted to recover. In Starr <em>v. </em>Pease, <a href="/conn/8/0541-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="8 Conn. 541" data-case-ids="6753681" data-case-paths="/conn/8/0541-01">8 Conn. 541</a>, 2 U. S. Digest 826, p. 154, the Supreme Court of that state bound it by the exit of the writ. But as the accretion of subsequent profits might still require a supplemental action, and as a part of these might be barred pending the ejectment, the rules of that court might not answer all the purposes of justice, departing from the English practice in a singular particular, it would be idle to stop short of full relief; and we are bound to allow profits to be recovered for the whole time which has preceded the verdict. Nor is there any lack of analogy for it. By the Statute of Merton, a widow is entitled to damages for detention of dower, from the death till the judgment, yet damages are always given by an inquest, on a judgment of seisin by default, till the taking of the inquisition. Even interest on a penalty, or promissory note, is given as damages for the detention of the debt till the time of the verdict, and thus we see that though no part of the action must appear in the pleadings to have arisen after the inception of the suit, the principle does not prevent the recovery of an accessory which has accrued subsequently, consequently the damages here were well assessed: Dawson <em>v. </em>McGill, <em>4 </em>Whart.</p>

We think they have, if they prove that the plaintiffs had other remedies to which they might have resorted, and to which the statutory limitation is not applicable, but selected one to which it does apply.

In Jackson <em>v. </em>Varick, <a href="/wend/2/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="2 Wend. 294" data-case-ids="3516384" data-case-paths="/wend/2/0294-01">2 Wend. 294</a>, the Supreme Court of the same state refused, in an action for mesne profits, where the defendant had pleaded' the general issue alone, to allow on motion the plea of the statute to be added, <em>“ </em>because it is a strict defence, and if defendant lets it slip, the court will not relieve him,” and permitted a recovery from the date of the demise. So well understood in England was it that in an action for mesne profits at law the statute applies that in analogy to it the Court of Chancery adopted the limitation in many cases where bills were filed, praying for an account of rents, issues, and profits. We will refer to a single case in Prince <em>v. </em>Hiland. A term for years was held by two tenants in common, one dying, the survivor retained possession, and refused to account to the personal representative of the deceased. He filed his bill for an account, and Lord Chancellor Hardwicke held that in such a case had the statute been relied upon in the answer to the account, it would have been restrained to the last six years: 1 Atk. 493. The application of the statute to such cases is recognised in Reed <em>v. </em>Reed, 5 Ves. 743; Harwood <em>v. </em>Oglander, 6 Id. 213, 214, 515, and Stackhouse <em>v. </em>Boonstone, 10 Id. 469; so also in the Supreme Court of the United States, and in several of the state courts: Green <em>v. </em>Biddle, <a href="/us/21/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="8 Wheat. 1" data-case-ids="6136159" data-case-paths="/us/21/0001-01">8 Wheat. 1</a>; Kane <em>v. </em>Blood-good, 7 Johns. Oh. Rep. 107. In New York it was also held that as the statute operates as a bar to a recovery for mesne profits, they will not allow interest for more than six years, to be recovered on a warranty of title for defect, of which the vendee was evicted: Statts <em>v. </em>Ten Eyck, <a href="/cai/3/0111-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="3 Cai.

In Houston <em>v. </em>Wiekersham the Statute of Limitations was not pleaded; indeed it could not have been with propriety, as the plaintiff stated the time for which he claimed to recover to be from 1st of June 1837 to 13th of October 1839, and Mr, Justice Houston, in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, merely remarked on that subject, ‘the Statute of Limitations maybe pleaded to all beyond six years,’ and referred to <a href="/yeates/3/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="3 Yeates 13" data-case-ids="6770943" data-case-paths="/yeates/3/0013-01">3 Yeates 13</a>. In Lynch <em>v. </em>Cox, in which the statute was pleaded, Chief Justice Black said, ‘neither in ejectment nor in trespass can a plaintiff recover mesne profits for more than six years,’ but cited no authority. Nor did the case require it, as the judgment of the court below was reversed, and the opinion delivered predicated on other grounds.</p>

Judge Smyser has furnished us with an abstract of the original record. It appears that the ejectment was brought June 10th 1788, and demise laid 10th of June 1788, for seven years; that the pleas were ‘ not guilty, and the Statute of Limitations;’ that the case was removed to the Court of Nisi Prius by <em>certiorari </em>on the 28th of August 1789, and tried at West Chester, before C. J. Shippen and Justice Yeates, and a verdict rendered for plaintiff. ‘Judgment absolute May 9th 1791.’ The action for mesne profits was commenced on 10th of November 1795, and under the instructions of the court ‘ that the plaintiff is entitled to mesne profits from 10th of September 1789 to 9th of June 1791, allowing one month in which to execute the <em>hab. fac. possessionem. </em>The plaintiff recovered ¿035 damages. Thus clearly showing that the statute was applied under the direction of the court. We therefore think, whatever may have been the reasons for it, that the doctrine is established too firmly to be shaken; that in cases of trespass for mesne profits the statute, if pleaded, bars a recovery for all over six years from the bringing of the action. I have carefully examined all the English and American cases within my reach, and have found but one instance in which the general rule on this subject is controverted. It is Murphy <em>v. </em>
      <a id="p24" href="#p24" data-label="24" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*24</a>Guion, in which Judge Hall, of the Supreme Court of North Carolina, delivered a short opinion, citing no authorities, but said: 4 It seems to be a very wrong construction of the act to say that a recovery can be had of the profits of the land for the last three years, only before the commencement of the action, when the action of ejectment may have been pending ten or more years, and the defendant has been in the receipt of the profits during that time, and when an action could not be commenced for them until after possession gained by the action of ejectment. It is true there is a <em>dictum </em>in Buller’s Nisi Prius that seems to be sustained by some other books, but no adjudged case is found upon which it rests 13 N. C. Rep. 238; 2 Murphy’s Rep. 238 ; Carolina L. Repository 94.</p>

Perhaps it is a work of needless labour ; if it is, we have the reflection to console us that no injustice has been done by our decision, but that the plaintiffs have received their measure of law, according to the rules which govern the remedy of their choice.</p>
