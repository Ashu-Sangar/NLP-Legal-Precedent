    <p class="summary" id="b339-8" data-blocks='[["BL_339.8",339,[183,754,1166,945]]]'>“ This matter comes before us on petition, answer, and evidence. On consideration of the latter we are all of the opinion that John H. Grim, before the death of his wife, was what it is evident she apprehended he would be after her death. We are also all agreed that after her death his habits of drunkenness and revelry continued to be the same (if not worse) than before her death. How, then, does this codicil operate upon the state of facts ? It is said that if the word ‘ again’ or ‘ continue’ had been used it would have been plain what she meant; but inasmuch as it must be presumed she knew his habits better than any one else, she must have comprehended a worse degree of intemperance than any which had previously existed. We are not of this opinion. This codicil was made but a short time previous to her death, and in view of her speedy dissolution. Her husband was what is called a ‘spreeing man,’ sometimes drunk and then again for a period entirely sober. In this latter state one of the witnesses swore he was about the time of her last illness. The wife was hopeful. At all events we will not suffer her intention to be invaded because she did not think proper in her last moments to drop a word which might have been considered one of reproach, which would make her codicil a kind of a lecture which she did not then feel in the spirit to give.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b339-9" data-blocks='[["BL_339.9",339,[182,1700,1165,731]],["BL_340.1",340,[279,391,1162,646]]]'>“But there are other objections to the making this rule absolute. The condition in this codicil is a subsequent one, and is to be construed with strictness, as it is intended to divest an estate already vested. The rule is, that such a condition in respect to a legacy shall be construed to be a mere declaration <em>in terrorem, </em>unless where there is a limitation over. This, it is argued, is the case here. The fund, it is true, goes into the <em>residuum, </em>but that is not sufficient; there must be an express limitation over. The foundation of the rule itself is spoken of as unreasonable. The consequence is, it will be found to be much modified. Whether a mere <em>residuary </em>bequest amounts to a disposition of the legacy within the rule, has been in practice the subject of considerable doubt. The following distinction is said to be correct. ■ If the testator give no direction for the legacy to fall into the residue, a disposition of that fund cannot be a limitation over of the individual legacy, because it is not permitted to form a part of the residue. On the other hand, if <a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>the testator direct the legacy to fall into the residue so that it becomes disposable as part of that estate, such direction will be virtually a limitation over of the particular legacy: 1 Roper on Leg. 556. The same rule was also stated in Lloyd <em>v. </em>Bracton, 3 Meriv. 108, 118, cited and referred to in Roper on Leg., vol. 1, p. 557. How is the legacy limited here, in case it is forfeited under the conditions mentioned in the codicil ? The expression in the codicil is, £ and my estate to be disposed of as above directed,’ referring to the will. There the testatrix says, £ and at his decease the principal, after deducting the expenses of execution, to be equally divided among the heirs of my brothers and sister as soon as it can be conveniently collected together.’ We hold, therefore, that the expression in the codicil, in connection with the residue clause in the will, amounts to a limitation over of the legacy.</p>

    <p id="b341-5" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[172,486,1165,475]]]'>No doubt these were conditions, and conditions subsequent, which, without a limitation over in case of forfeiture, would not be sufficient to divest the legacy. The law would regard them as directions <em>in terrorem. </em>The cases of Hoopes <em>v. </em>Dundas, 10 Barr 75, Bennett <em>v. </em>Robison, <a href="/watts/10/0348-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Watts 348" data-case-ids="1850958" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0348-01">10 Watts 348</a>, Cassell <em>v. </em>Lovett’s Ex’rs., ll Casey, and numerous other cases in our books, establish this as the rule in regard to legacies. The direction in the codicil, that the legacy to Grim, in case of a failure of the conditions, or either of them, should fall into the corpus of the estate, to be distributed as provided for in the will, was a good limitation over: <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%20575" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Whart. 575">3 Wh. 575</a>; 3 Meriv. 118; Rop. on Leg. 551.</p>
    <p id="b341-6" data-blocks='[["BL_341.6",341,[173,960,1164,247]]]'>The only question then in the case is, whether the legacy was forfeited for a breach of either of the conditions. If any fact can be established by testimony, I think the testimony before the court showed, beyond doubt, that the legatee had fallen into a condition of “drunkenness and revelry;” that this was his habit.</p>
    <p id="b341-7" data-blocks='[["BL_341.7",341,[172,1218,1166,1031]]]'>The idea that the testatrix only meant that he should be no more intemperate than he had been in her lifetime, if intemperate then, is a suggestion in regard to her intentions which we cannot adopt. She evidently intended that her bounty should not be squandered in drunkenness and revelry, and she sought, although in vain, to afford him support in a life of decency and sobriety, and at the same time hoped no doubt to create an incentive to temperance; but for a failure in this respect, her intentions are clearly expressed that the bounty provided for him should go to her own blood relations. It was against drunkenness and its concomitant she was providing, and even if it had been shown that he was a drunkard and reveller in her lifetime, and that he was no worse after her death, it would be equally plain that the condition was broken, and the legacy forfeited. But we are not driven to this, for the evidence greatly preponderates in establishing that he was much more intemperate after the death of his wife than before. It clearly shows that he had grievously fallen into “ drunkenness and revelry.” The court were entirely right, we think, in finding the facts as they did. If it be true, as the testimony seems to show, that the appellant had, before this controversy began, bought from Grim his interest under his wife’s will, no one will sympathize much with him that the forfeiture has fallen on his hands. Such a purchase was both illegal and reprehensible. There was no error in the decree as to costs.</p>
