He shall have power to remit fines and forfeitures, &amp;c.; and certainly nothing is more of a forfeiture than a recognisance forfeited. A judgment upon it adds no additional force, but is the mode of reaping it. Besides, the forfeitures which may be remitted are such, and such only, as were originally payable to the state, and the recognisance remitted belongs to that class.

Any other doctrine might result in perpetual imprisonment, and sentence to imprisonment one year would, in many cases, be equivalent to a sentence for life.

Nor has it been understood to repeal the laws expressly providing for the liability of the defendant for the costs upon a conviction. Conviction of an indictable offence, followed by judgment, always fixes the liability of the defendant for the costs. Even the acts providing for the payment of the costs by the county in cases of felony do not discharge the defendant. The Act of 28th September 1791, § 15 (3 Smith’s Laws 44), enacts that “in all cases of conviction 'of an offence, punishable capitally or by imprisonment at hard labour, the county where the crime is committed, shall pay the costs of prosecution, <em>if the defendant hath not property sufficient to discharge the same.”</em>
