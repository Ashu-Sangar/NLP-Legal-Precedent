    <p id="b336-11" data-blocks='[["BL_336.13",336,[278,1508,1160,511]]]'>It is a settled rule in equity, that the specific performance of a contract will not be decreed unless its terms are clear and capable of ascertainment from the instrument itself: Story’s Eq. Juris. § 767. So courts of equity will not ordinarily entertain bills for the specific execution of contracts with variations or additions, or new terms to be made and introduced into them by parol: Id. 770. It requires no argument or illustration to bring this imperfect or indefinite contract within these rules. It is open and apparent upon its face that it requires much aid from parol evidence to perfect it, besides, nothing whatever was done towards its completion but the payment of $20, when the contract, if contract it be, was made.</p>

Eq. PL, by Jeremy, 218; Story’s Eq. Pl. §§ 448, 449, 647. As already stated, the case made by the bill was for the specific execution of a contract for the sale of real estate resting partly in writing and partly in parol. The defence that it was not a case for a decree we think was sufficiently raised by the demurrer.</p>
