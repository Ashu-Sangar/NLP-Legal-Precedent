It was an advance payment on the oil, to aid in carrying it to the vendee. It was not to be a payment of freight earned that was meant; for as soon as the freight should be earned by a delivery to the consignee, the oil itself was to be paid for — so says the contract — and then the vendors would need no advance. The oil was to be gauged on delivery: so that at the moment of time when the freight would be earned, if the case should be put on the strict commercial' meaning of the word freight, that would be just the time when the oil itself was to be paid for. It was entirely too narrow a ground to assume, that the advance to be made was to meet the demand for freight earned by the carriers before the delivery and the gauging of the oil. Putting the case strictly on the footing of a marine contract, the consignees would <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>have been the party to pay the freight to the master, without any contract to that effect; but this was not intended to be the nature of the contract. It was simply an agreement to advance such part of the price of the oil as should be necessary to enable the defendants to send it on. The court erred, therefore, in ruling as they did, “ that the plaintiff was only bound, by the contract, to pay or advance the freight on delivery of the oil by the carrier.” So, too, it was error to receive evidence of a general custom on the subject of paying freight to the carrier on delivery of goods, because the parties had made their own contract, and it was susceptible of easy explication, and needed no aid from custom, and could not be controlled by it.</p>
