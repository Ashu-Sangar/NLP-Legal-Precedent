    <p class="summary" id="b250-12" data-blocks='[["BL_250.12",250,[264,1336,1165,461]]]'>On the 18th of May 1861, Robert Hunter presented his petition to the Quarter Sessions, asking for the appointment of viewers to lay out a private road for his use, from his residence to a public road, through lands of Jacob Neno and David M. McGunigle. On this petition, three viewers were appointed, who, on the 28th of May, reported in favour of the road as prayed for, assigning no damages for the persons through whose land it was laid out. This report was accompanied by a draft in due form. On the 5th of June 1861, the report of viewers was confirmed <em>nisi. </em>After which, the following orders were made in the case:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b250-13" data-blocks='[["BL_250.13",250,[265,1806,1162,259]]]'>• “ September 28d 1861. This report having been made to the court, and presented in due time, but not formally approved, it is now approved, and the road when opened is directed to be opened of the width of twenty feet. This approval to remain open one term before confirmation. By the Court. December 23d 1861, confirmed by the Court.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b250-14" data-blocks='[["BL_250.14",250,[264,2065,1166,300]]]'>The order to open went out on the 28th December 1861, and under that order the road was opened and made. Some time after the road had been opened and made, to wit, on the 28th May 1862, on motion of John N. McOlowry, attorney, a rule was granted to show cause why the approval, confirmation, and order to open the road, made on the 23d day of December 1861, should not be set aside for the following reasons:—</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b251-6" data-blocks='[["BL_251.6",251,[209,483,1165,131]]]'>2. The confirmation of the report was premature, and contrary to the order of the court, made on the 23d day of September 1861, requiring the report to lie over one more term.</p>

The omission to fix the width in the very <em>decree </em>of confirmation <em>nisi, </em>was cured by fixing it during the term. All parties had the time allowed by taw for filing exceptions, and therefore the road seems to have been duly granted in December 1861.</p>
