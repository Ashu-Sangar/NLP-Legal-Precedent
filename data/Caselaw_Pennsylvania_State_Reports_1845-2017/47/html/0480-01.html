The promise to pay to the carriers the price of the goods they had been compelled to pay Given &amp; Brother, and the cost of carriage, is the equally clear foundation of the second count.

The power of amendment, wisely committed to the courts to prevent a failure of justice in many instances, has never been extended to the changing of forms of action, and there is no doubt the power- to this extent does not exist at common law, though judicial interpretation has engrafted it upon the supervisory power of the courts over appeals from justices of the peace, who are often wholly ignorant of the proper form of action to be stated on their docket.</p>

It is also often a cause of regret in the Supreme Court, that a case otherwise well tried must be reversed upon this technical ground. It would be a wise provision to confer the power of amendment over the form of action, with such an equitable control of the costs as would prevent injustice.</p>

Undoubtedly a wagoner who hauls away goods in the course of his usual employment, may involve his employer, to whose place of business he takes them and where they are used, in the consequences of a taking; but it by no means follows that by a taking he commits his employers to the consequences of a fraud. It requires more than this to create liability, in an action founded directly upon the fraud.</p>
