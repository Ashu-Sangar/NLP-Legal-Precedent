They had very express authority by the incorporating law to buy, hold, mortgage, and sell lands; and, in locating their road, they probably found it expedient to buy the Lukens farm rather than pay damages for crossing it. This is often the true policy of railroad companies. But lands so bought and not actually dedicated to corporate purposes are bound by the lien of judgments, and are liable to be levied in execution, and sold by the sheriff in the same manner and with the same effect as the lands of any other debtor. As to land which has been appropriated to corporate objects, and is necessary for the full enjoyment and exercise of any franchise of the company, whether <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>acquired by purchase, or by the exercise of the delegated power of eminent domain, the company hold it entirely exempt from levy and sale; and this on no ground of prerogative or immunity, for the company can no more alien or transfer such land by their own act than can creditor by legal process; but the exemption rests on the public interests involved in the corporation.”</p>
    <p id="b471-6" data-blocks='[["BL_471.4",471,[201,664,1157,559]]]'>The learned judge then proceeds to show that a canal basin is no legitimate incident to a railroad, and if a railroad company possess it, it must be from express grant, or necessary implication from the express grants. He concludes by stating the principles upon which the case ought to have been tried, and says: “ but what portion of the ground had become appurtenant to the road by appropriation, such as we have described, was a question of fact which ought to have been left, to the jury.” “If there even was any appropriation made by stakes or fences, or other acts on the ground, the company ought to be able to show it by the most irrefragable proof.” These, are the same principles we have already stated as governing this case. Let us test the case by them.</p>
    <p id="b471-7" data-blocks='[["BL_471.5",471,[200,1223,1157,463]]]'>The Danville and Pottsville Railroad Company had full power to buy, hold, mortgage, sell and dispose of lands, and make dividends of their profits independently of their railroad; and the power to erect, make, and establish all works, edifices, and devices to such railroad as may by the said company be deemed expedient for the purposes of carrying into effect the objects of their incorporation. The expressed restriction of the charter was, that the company should possess no <em>“ </em>liberties, privileges, or franchises, but such as may be necessary or incident to the making of the said railroad and the prosecution of the coal trade.”</p>
    <p id="b471-8" data-blocks='[["BL_471.6",471,[196,1697,1161,727]]]'>. So far as the railroad was involved its purposes were of a public nature — the transportation of freight and passengers — but so far as the company prosecuted the coal trade, it was an object of private gain, not essential to the railroad franchise, and which they might or might not prosecute at pleasure. Now, admitting that the company might, by implication from the language of the charter, establish a basin, as a device for the more convenient carrying on of the coal trade, yet it was a work not essential to the railroad franchise involving the public interests, and therefore one the company might establish or withdraw at their pleasure. A basin may be very convenient to enable boats to approach a railroad and take freight from its cars, but clearly it does not belong to it, constitutes no essential incident, and, therefore, like warehouses, coal-yards, machine-shops, &amp;c., is an independent structure. The exemption, as remarked by Justice Woodward, is not corporate immunity, but rests on the public interests involved in the corporation.</p>

From that time until the date of the mortgage, a period of twenty years, no basin was ever made and used upon them. An excavation was made in two of the lots, and near to the road-bed an excavation had been made to obtain material for the embankment. The road embankment occupied about ten feet along the northern end of twelve of the lots. On one of the lots there had been a car-house — one hundred feet from it a water-tank, and between them a turn-table. A warehouse was moved up from the railroad upon one corner of one of the lots. There had also been some trestlework extending over upon one of the lots, from which coal was dumped. Fish, the superintendent, says, there never was a complete basin for shipping coal since he knew it. But he states that the road has been extended to a basin and locks into the river above town. The lock was commenced in 1853 and finished in 1855. This was done under the Act of 2d April 1853, authorizing the Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad Company to change the terminus of their road, and construct a basin on the river for the shipment of coal.</p>

These facts prove very clearly that while it probably was the intention of the company at some time or other to establish a basin on these lots, the actual appropriation never was finally made.</p>

The charter of the first-named company required them to commence the work within three years, and complete it within seven. It further provided, that “ if, after the completion of the said railroad, the said corporation shall suffer the same to go to decay and be impassable for the term of two years, then this charter to become null and void.”</p>

    <p id="b473-7" data-blocks='[["BL_473.5",473,[159,621,1166,991]]]'>No sale being effected, then came the Act of April 2d 1860, which is important as showing that the company had failed in every particular to accomplish the purposes of its charter. It recites the state guaranty of interest and the mortgage for the loans, amounting to $300,000, that the company constructed ten miles of road from the eastern terminus, which they have permitted to go to ruin, and twenty miles from Sunbury to Shamokin coal-field, of which they have practically abandoned all care; that the company is insolvent, and there is no reasonable prospect they will ever complete their railroad, and relieve the state of an annual drain of $15,000. That the railroad is yearly decreasing in value, and in a year or two will be useless for all purposes of transportation, and an immediate sale is therefore necessary. The act then provides for making a sale of the railroad and franchises, and closes with this proviso : “ That nothing contained in this act shall be held, taken, or construed to interfere with or affect the title of Reuben Fagely in and to certain lots of ground in the borough of Sunbury, sold by the sheriff of Northumberland county as the property of said railroad company, and purchased at said sheriff’s sale by the said Reuben Fagely; nor shall any sale under the provisions of this act or any of the acts herein referred to, be held to divest the title of the said Reuben Fagely, his heirs and assigns, in and to said lots.”</p>
    <p id="b473-8" data-blocks='[["BL_473.6",473,[158,1613,1162,258]]]'>By the terms of this act the proceeds of sale were to be paid to the loanholders, and the mortgage was to be satisfied. The sale was limited to a sum not less than $130,000, and the state to become responsible for the interest upon the residue of the loan unpaid by the sale. The loanholders’ assent was to he obtained by the auditor-general.</p>

All parties interested united in so considering it. The state was deeply interested, yet she recognised the sheriff’s sale to Fagely, and provided that the sale under the Act of 1850 should not affect his title. The creditors by their assent to the act did the same. The railroad company did the same, having permitted the sale of the lots to Fagely without objection. The company was bound to speak out at the time of acknowledgment of the sheriff’s deed. They also acquiesced in the sale under the Act of 1850. And lastly, the Phila<a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>delphia and Sunbury Company, as purchasers under the Act of 1850, were bound by its terms; and by their after-purchase of the lots from Fagely, whose title is referred to in the act, gave unquestionable evidence of their understanding of the facts, and the reasons which led to a saving in the act of Fagely’s title.</p>
    <p id="b474-5" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[319,619,1160,215]]]'>The point of these remarks is not to show a ratification of a void sale, but by the united conduct and understanding of all the parties, that no actual appropriation of the lots to the basin had ever been fully made; and therefore that the sale was not void, but valid.</p>
    <p id="b474-6" data-blocks='[["BL_474.5",474,[319,830,1156,222]]]'>The facts of the case, when properly viewed, prove most conclusively there never was such an actual appropriation or subordination of these lots .to the purchase of the company, as prevented their levy and sale, held as they were by purchase independently of the franchise for railroad purposes.</p>
    <p id="b474-7" data-blocks='[["BL_474.6",474,[319,1051,1158,343]]]'>But the case is susceptible on its facts of being presented in a still stronger light. Admitting, for the sake of the argument, that the lots were purchased for the purpose of establishing a basin, that the company took steps toward its construction, and carried their design into part execution, it is still a case'when the sale must now be supported, and the Philadelphia and Sun-bury Company, as purchasers under the Act of 1850 and of Fagely, are estopped from denying its validity.</p>

The company was at the mercy of the legislature, and had besides become totally insolvent, and incapable of finishing its work. Still they were permitted to struggle on until 1846, when the legislature, in authorizing the sale of the railroad and franchises, offered by a proviso in the Act of 1846 a further indulgence, that if $400,000 of new stock were raised, the sale should not take place, and the company should be allowed three years more to complete the road. This was not done, and the Act of 1850 was passed. The company could not help itself, and as, between the state, the creditors, and the purchasers under the Act of 1850, this act created a contract. The Commonwealth and the creditors gave their express assent to the sale upon the terms of the act, while the act itself gave to the terms the sanction and the operation of law. The purchasers who bought under the terms of the act became, by the act of purchase, bound by its provisions. Now, by the express terms of the law, nothing contained in it was to be construed to interfere with or affect Fagely’s title, nor should a sale under it be held to divest this title. This was not merely a recognition that Fagely had a title, but a stipulation that the purchaser under the law should take nothing in prejudice of his <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>title. When the Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad Company purchased, they assented to this stipulation. The Commonwealth having the power to relinquish her title by forfeiture, and to ratify acts however inconsistent with the public franchise she had granted, the creditors having assented, the Danville and Pottsville Railroad Company being unable to dissent, and not having dissented from the sale, arid the Philadelphia and Sun-bury having' given its assent by purchasing under the terms proposed, and afterwards purchasing from Fagely, the latter company must clearly be estopped from asserting the invalidity of Fagely’s title.</p>
    <p id="b475-6" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[146,889,1160,331]]]'>The case then came down to the time of the Philadelphia and Sunbury Company. Did this company appropriate those lots to the purpose of a basin ? Of this there is not a particle of evidence. On the contrary, the company procured legislation to change the termination of the road and make a basin for shipping coal into the river; and besides, suffered themselves to be assessed and to pay taxes on these lots independently of the railroad.</p>
    <p id="b475-7" data-blocks='[["BL_475.5",475,[146,1233,1160,248]]]'>There can be no pretence, therefore, upon the whole ease, that these lots were a part of the franchise when the mortgage to Priestly was made. The finding of the jury separated the part aetually used for the track of the road, and left it in possession of the defendants below. This is all they could ask under the evidence.</p>
    <p id="b475-8" data-blocks='[["BL_475.6",475,[691,1493,566,43]]]'>The judgment must be affirmed.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b475-9" data-blocks='[["BL_475.7",475,[145,1578,1160,85]]]'>Woodward, C. J., dissented, and Read, J., was absent during the argument.</p>
