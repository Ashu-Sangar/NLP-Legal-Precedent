This lot of ground was the property of John ITerster, and was taken by the company in the following manner : On the 31st January 1856, the company presented their petition to the Court of Common Pleas of Northampton county setting forth their Act of incorporation, ‘and that in selecting a place for their reservoir find it necessary to occupy this lot of ground.

The statute of incorporation -was potent to vest the title the moment the constitutional impediment was removed, by virtue of the right and power of eminent domain, which is defined by Chancellor Kent to be ‘the inherent sovereign power of a state, which gives to the legislature the control of private property for public uses:’ 2 Kent’s Com. 339 n. Our land titles are derived from the state, and are granted subject to the right of eminent domain. This vesting of the title of private property in the company for public purposes by operation of law, constitutes the ‘ taking and appropriating within the meaning of the constitution.’ This judgment in favour of Mr. Butz, as we have seen, was not compensation, but only security for the damages. And the lien, both at law and in equity, attached the moment the title vested. This lien constitutes the adequacy of the security on which the title vested in the company. The lien of this judgment has priority over all the other liens as against the Butz lot. First in equity, because given to secure the consideration-money for the lot. In law, because prior in date to any other encumbrance on the legal title of Mr. Butz, and the 10th section of the Act of incorporation authorizes a judgment to be entered for the ‘damages or compensation’ in such cases, and that execution be issued therefor as in other cases.’</p>
