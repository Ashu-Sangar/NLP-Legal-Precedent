Winters McFall, in conversation with William S. Smith, of William S. Smith &amp; Co., in Philadelphia, was told that it was safe to buy all the grain he could store away. McFall said that his firm were short of funds. The conversation turned about Smith’s accepting the draft of McFall &amp; Martin. He said he would accept their draft to raise money to buy grain with, if they would give him a judgment. McFall then gave him a judgment-note, whereby “ McFall &amp; Martin” promised to pay him or order, three months after date, $3000.

McFall swears positively to the fact, and the auditor has reported it to be a fact, but that it did not impress itself on Mr. Armstrong’s memory. It is to be noticed, that the testimony of Mr. Armstrong is that “ he thinks bis first knowledge of Smith <em>k </em>Co.’s judgment was obtained after the judgments of appellees were entered.” He does not testify that he did not see the receipt for the judgment-note before the judgments were entered.</p>

It must be conceded then that Mr. Armstrong did see the receipt, and the question is, what is the effect upon the appellees of the communication of that knowledge to him at that time. It can hardly be disputed, that if the appellees had been present in person at that interview between Mr. Armstrong and Messrs. McEall <em>k </em>Martin, and they had acquired the same knowledge before the single bills were drawn, or the judgments entered, as that which was communicated to Mr. Armstrong, that it was such information as made inquiry a duty, which, if pursued, would have led to a knowledge of the judgment itself, and would therefore have been to them such notice as would have bound them.</p>

We contend that he became so at the interview between him and McFall <em>k </em>Martin, when he drew the bills single and took them with him to have the judgments entered upon them. It is true that he did this at the request of McEall &amp; Martin, but it was in the interest of the appellees and to secure their debts that he did it. He drew the judgment-notes on the 22d January, and on the 23d of January <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>he took them to the office of the prothonotary, had judgments entered upon them, and at the same time entered his name upon the record as the attorney for the plaintiffs in the judgments. He was then the attorney upon the record on January 23d 1862 of the appellees. Can either Mr. Armstrong or his clients, then, be permitted'to contradict the record, and to say that although the record showed him to be the attorney, he was not so in fact ? 1 Bacon’s Abridgment, title <em>Attorney, </em>C., p. 295.</p>
    <p id="b133-6" data-blocks='[["BL_133.4",133,[144,767,1165,1120]]]'>But it is said that Mr. Armstrong entered his name as attorney for the plaintiffs in the judgments <em>“ </em>in .compliance with a custom believed by him to be universal.” We deny the universality of the custom; but whether he did it 'in compliance with a custom or not, he was none the less the attorney of the plaintiffs upon the record. But the appellees never complained that he had acted as their attorney without authority. On the contrary, they assented to and ratified all that Mr. Armstrong had done in their behalf. After that time he was directed by three of the appellees to issue executions, and he did issue executions on all the judgments entered January 23d 1862. Can the appellees, therefore, claim that Mr. Armstrong’s acts as their attorney were proper, and give them their approval so long as they were beneficial to them, and repudiate him as their attorney and deny his authority to bind them, so soon as they find that they are to be injuriously affected by information received by him, while engaged in the transaction of their business ? Was it not their business ? The chief, if not the only subjects of conversation at the consultation between McFall, Martin, and Mr. Armstrong, were the embarrassments of the firm, and the question how they would secure the appellees, whom they called their “ confidential creditors.” Why they were “confidential” and “William S. Smith &amp; Co.” were not “confidential creditors,” does not clearly appear. The only facts that appear are that the appellees had their debts unsecured by judgments, while Smith &amp; Oo. advanced their money upon the security of a judgment-note.</p>

Such was the case according to the finding of the auditor. When Armstrong was informed that MePall &amp; Martin had given William S.

He became their counsel afterwards, but if he had been their counsel at the time of the above communication, it could not avail the appellants as actual notice to the appellees, for it was neither definite nor personal. Whether Armstrong ever informed them of what he had heard from MeEall does not appear, and is immaterial, for it was not such notice of a judgment as a creditor is bound by law to give to subsequent encumbrancers. The law requires him to have it properly docketed and indexed, or in default of these, which amount only to constructive notice, to bring home notice to subsequent encumbrancers that shall be actual.
