The single question is the power of the receiver to make publication as he did.

It is therefore needless to repeat all that he has so well said. I may remark, however, that not being familiar with the legislation for the city, at the time of the argument, my mind was left rather impressed with a belief that a power to contract might be lodged in the several departments in reference to particular objects. Rut a careful reading of the Consolidation Act and its supplements as to this point, has produced'an opposite conviction.</p>
    <p id="b22-12" data-blocks='[["BL_22.15",22,[339,2066,1159,421]]]'>It is manifest that the city government is founded in its leading thought upon the American idea of a popular representative government, its immediate prototype being the form of the state government. The right of supervision and control is therefore vested in the councils as the immediate representatives of the popular will, which exerts and enforces its determining power, by means of constantly recurring elections. Subject to this primary power the affairs of this people, great in numbers, wealth, intelligence, and influence, are conducted by departments and officers.</p>

      <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>The tendency to abuse and corruption to be found in the entire consolidation of power, causing the tyranny of a hydra-headed majority sometimes to equal that of a single despot, finds its counterpoise in the district system, which fairly represents the interests and influence of the minority. This check is applied to the immediate representatives of the people, and also to the subordinate departments and officers.</p>
    <p id="b23-5" data-blocks='[["BL_23.4",23,[126,720,1160,430]]]'>But in the exercise of their powers by departments and officers, the necessity of another counterpoise appears. For if these inferior agents were not subjected to a common rule, we should find in their mode of election, and distinct district representation, a variety and contrariety of purpose and action productive of utter confusion and disorder. The interests of a people so numerous and diverse in pursuits, employments, and localities, therefore require a common supervision and control, to be found nowhere in so much perfection as in those bodies which are their own immediate and responsible representatives.</p>
    <p id="b23-6" data-blocks='[["BL_23.5",23,[125,1150,1158,644]]]'>The greatest power of a people, and, as a consequence of human infirmity, their greatest corruption, are to be found in their money — their financial system. Hence the necessity of a perfect and entire control over the purse by the immediate representatives of the whole people. Let this power once be segregated in the disbursement, so that while there is but one purse, there are many hands to reach into it, and the preponderance of the separate selfish interest over the united public is immediately visible in the scramble it produces. Each then endeavours to grasp all and hold all it can. The power to contract is essentially a power to disburse. A <em>valid </em>contract is uncontrollable; demanding its performance at the hands of the judiciary, and calling to their aid the whole power of the government. If an appropriation for its payment is not made this year, it must be in the next, or some following.</p>
    <p id="b23-7" data-blocks='[["BL_23.6",23,[124,1795,1155,259]]]'>It is manifest, therefore, that an independent, uncontrolled power to contract resting in the several departments, or chief officers of the city, would in effect take the control of their own finances out of the hands of the people themselves, and lodge it where it would be liable to the most pernicious abuses, by extravagance, favouritism, and illegal expenditure.</p>

    <p id="b27-8" data-blocks='[["BL_27.6",27,[156,977,1165,687]]]'>This leaves another but subordinate question — the number of insertions of the advertisement. It is contended it must be in three papers. This is clearly wrong. The 11th section of the Consolidation Act made it the duty of the receiver of taxes, “ immediately after the first day of December, annually to give public notice in at least four of the public newspapers of said city for ten days to all persons who have omitted to pay their taxes, to pay them before the 1st day of January,” &amp;c. Then came the Act of April 21st 1855, the 13th section of which provided “ That <em>all </em>the <em>public advertising </em>for the said city, except for municipal claims, whether for elections, taxes, or otherwise, shall be inserted in no more than <em>three </em>daily newspapers, nor <em>more than three times </em>in each; nor shall there be paid for the same any greater rates than those advertised in such papers to be paid by the citizens, and the controller <em>shall pass no bill for advertising otherwise done” </em>&amp;c.</p>

The language “nor more than three,” clearly imports an option for a less number. But what is conclusive is, that the latter act is of greater extent and wider in its purpose than the former. The former relates specifically to the case of delinquent tax-payers. The latter extends to all public advertising, except municipal claims. Clearly it was not the intention of the legislature to control all the public advertising by the provision for delinquents alone. In the vast circle of the public affairs, why should all the advertising therefor be necessarily and compulsorily required to be inserted in no fewer as well as in no more than three papers ? We can well understand that a maximum should be fixed to prevent extravagant wastefulness ; but we cannot understand why the legislature should mean (for it did not say so) that every advertisement <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>should he inserted in three papers. We are compelled, therefore, by the purpose of the law, which was to regulate <em>all </em>advertising, to say that the legislature meant what it said, viz., “ nor in more than three papers,” which leaves an option to insert in fewer.</p>
    <p id="b28-6" data-blocks='[["BL_28.4",28,[287,587,1160,518]]]'>It is thought also that this construction militates against the interests of the tax-payers by exposing their property to sale upon insufficient notice. If the notice be too limited, the remedy lies with the legislature. But the complaint is perhaps less real than is supposed. In the first place, tax-paying is an annual recurrence at stated periods, so as to fix it in the minds of all property-owners as a duty not to be overlooked. In the next place, the tax-payer is reminded by advertisements of a general kind to pay, or that he will be advertised as a delinquent. Besides, in a populous city where every one is bound to do the same thing, a man is not apt to overlook what his neighbours are talking about as well as doing.</p>
