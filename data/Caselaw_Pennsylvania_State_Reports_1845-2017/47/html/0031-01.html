He left surviving him a widow, Anna Taylor, the appellant, and a mother, Lydia Taylor, the appellee, but no children. His death occurred after a short illness. All his estate was personalty, consisting chiefly, if not entirely, of bequests made by his uncle, George Williams, deceased, the larger part of which has not yet been realized. On the 27th of February, a. d. 1861, application was made to the register of wills by Anna Taylor, the widow, to admit to probate a nuncupative will of said decedent. This <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>application was resisted by Lydia Taylor the mother, the alleged will giving all the property of the decedent to the widow, and the mother, under the intestate laws of this Commonwealth, being entitled to receive one-half of it. After the taking of testimony and hearing the arguments of counsel, the register, on the 25th of June 1861, made a formal decree admitting the said nuncupative will to probate, and declaring that the same substantially in these words: “ I leave all that I possess in the world to my wife, Anna Taylor,” was duly made on the 9th day of March -1861, and that it had been duly proven according to law. On the 10th day of November 1863, Lydia Taylor, <em>the </em>mother, appealed from the decision of the register to the Register’s Court. On the 23d day of the same month, the Register’s Court, after argument by counsel upon the testimony as taken before the register, made its decision reversing the decree of the register, by which the said "will was admitted to probate, and sustaining the appeal of Lydia Taylor. From this decision of the Register’s Court the present appeal was taken.</p>

Mr. Peacock said, ‘ Yes, George, I have often heard you say so.” He was sick about two weeks,-but we did not expect his death, because he was often sick in the same way. He had a physician, but not for the two weeks. The doctor was called the day before his death; it was Ur. Course. He died about 12 o’clock in the day. When he died, nothing had been said about a will before, to my knowledge. His death was very unexpected to me, and to the family. This complaint of his was a customary one, and usually took him ten or twelve days to recover from these attacks. There was nothing in this last attack that led me to suppose it was in any way different from those he was subject to. The day he called his wife to his bedside, and had the conversation with her in the presence of Mr. Peacock and myself, was on the day he died, about 11 o’clock, about an hour before he died. I was in the room with him after that. After that conversation he seemed weak and languid. He conversed after that with his wife; I was bathing his head; he told his wife where <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>he would like to be buried, and what undertaker to have. He said some other things, but I could not understand, because he was choking like.”</p>

He retained his senses until within a few minutes of his death. I was in the room from the time he made this declaration until he died. There was an old lady in part of the time, Miss Hetty Williams, his aunt. She was in and out after this declaration was made. Mrs. Taylor and Mr. Peacock were also there. Mr. Peacock was in and out from the time this declaration occurred until he did. When he said these words to Mrs. Taylor, I thought for the first time that he was going to die. He complained of being weak; don’t remember of his saying anything about pain. The physician was sent for, and came twice before his death; he was sent for the day before, he came about 8 o’clock of the morning he died, and did not come again, nor was he sent for, that I know of, until he died. I did not hear Mr. Taylor say anything about a will at all, only what I have before repeated. This choking I speak of occurred only a few minutes before he died. Up to that time he laid quietly on his bed, talking to his wife. She was in and out of the room ; she couldn’t stay there and see him, he was so weak at the moment of his death. Mr. Peacock and myself were in the room. I think Mrs. Taylor was out in the kitchen. He appeared to know us all until a few minutes of his death. Mr. Peacock had been living in the family some time. I found him in the family before I came. No one told Mr. Taylor that he was going to die, that I know of. The words that I have repeated here are the words he gave. I could never forget them words. Can’t say whether Miss Hetty Williams was in the room when he spoke these words; she was in and out all the time.</p>

That was the first time that it crossed my mind that he was going to die; but I had no idea that it would be in an hour or that day; none of the family expected his death so sudden; they said nothing, but they all seemed surprised that he died. There was nothing said in my presence about sending for somebody to write his will. They had pen, ink, and paper about the house, When the death-rattle occurred, we were all surprised that it had taken place so soon. Mr. Peacock appeared to be an intimate friend of the family.”</p>

He died at the corner of Fifth street and Appletree alley, at his own residence, where he had resided a year or more previously. About an hour and a half he took his wife by the hand and said to her, <em>‘ </em>I have been a bad husband to you, and you have been a good wife to me, but I hope you will forgive me. All that I possess in the world I leave to you.’ Then he called me up and said, ‘ Jimmy, did you hear that ?’ He likewise spoke to his servant Mary, and asked her to bear witness to it also. I left then to go for a physician. I found he was getting wmrse after I got back from the doctor’s (I did not find the doctor home). I found him in a dying state; he died with his hand in mine. To the best of my belief, he died in an hour and a half after he had made this declaration. He begged to be buried at Laurel Hill. That wish was complied with. Mrs. Taylor and I went out and selected a lot, and got a deed for it. I did not reduce the substance of this will to writing at the time. Two days after his death I wrote a letter to Mr. Alexander Jeudon, who was a friend of Mr. Taylor’s, acquainting him of his death, and the disposition of his property. That letter is either mislaid or destroyed; it was sent. I also wrote a part of a letter to Mr. William Seaton, New York, but was interrupted during the time that I was writing, and it was neither finished nor sent. That portion of the letter I found among some papers that I had taken from this city to Bath, Long Island. (Letter shown witness.) That is the letter of which I speak. (Letter marked A, and hereto annexed.) It was written on the day it bears date. Mr. Jeudon lived, at the time I wrote him, in New York, French’s hotel. He lives now at the Globe hotel, New York. Mr. Taylor’s death was sudden and unexpected on the part of his friends. It was only about the time he made that declaration that any one thought he would die. He had told his wife and myself that he had made a written will, and that the draft of it was in the hands of Morgan Hinchman, and that he had left everything to his wife in that will. He did not mention that will at the time he was dying. After his death I made the inquiry of Morgan Hinchman. He informed me that no will had been executed by him.”</p>

      <em>Cross-examined. </em>— “ I hare every reason to believe that Mr. Taylor, at the time he made this declaration, was in the perfect possession of his senses, but weak. When he spoke to the servant girl he said, ‘Mary, did you hear that ?’ The only persons in the room at that time were the deceased, his wife,.Mary, and myself. Miss Iletty Williams may have been there also, but I don’t recollect the fact. At the time he made this declaration, I thought he would die very soon. That was the reason I ran for the doctor. The doctor had been there but two hours before. I didn’t hear him say anything that day about a will, any further than I have mentioned. He didn’t request me to reduce what he had said to writing. Within a month before his death I had heard him say that he had made his will, and left all to his wife. He mentioned it also afterwards, during the time he was in bed during his last sickness.”</p>

I had visited him several times the morning before he died. He died unexpectedly to me. I have had many patients similarly situated, and -whose habits were similar to his, who have recovered. I told Mr. Williams and his wife that morning that I did not think he would die, although he was in a dangerous state. He seemed to be entirely sound in his mind that day. He asked me that morning my opinion of the state of his health, and I told him I did not think he would die, that I thought I could bring him out; but I told him that his habits were adverse to health or long life. He must have sunk very rapidly. I was sent for, but was out. I reached his bedside near noon, when he was dead. He had apparently died a few minutes before. His wife was present, and I think Mr. Peacock was there. I remember distinctly that he was. I think there were others there, but can’t say positively.

It sets forth no words of a testamentary kind to show the <em>animus.testandi, </em>nor the disposition of his property. It is only the assertion of the writer, that he left his property to his wife. This is the writer’s will, not the testator’s. The law requires the words of the testator, or their substance, so that from them the testamentary disposition may appear. So, in committing to writing a nuncupative will, other facts should be stated in addition to the testamentary words, or their substance; such as his request to the bystander to bear witness that the words used are his will. Nothing of this was done. The proof was therefore entirely insufficient, and the Register’s Court were right in overruling the probate by the r egister.</p>
