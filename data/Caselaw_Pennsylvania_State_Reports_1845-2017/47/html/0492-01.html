    <p class="summary" id="b493-6" data-blocks='[["BL_493.4",493,[177,443,1162,776]]]'>This was an action of <em>assumpsit </em>by John Harter against Christian Bomberger. The defendant was duly enrolled in Manheim township, among the citizens subject to the draft made in October 1862, for nine months’ service. The quota of that township for the occasion was seventy-four. The commissioner, in drawing from the wheel, did not confine the draft to that number, but caused an excess to be drawn, and in that excess Christian Bomberger’s name was drawn to number one hundred and seventeen. The excess was intended to provide for deficiencies in the quota, by reason of disabilities which might entitle any of those drafted for the said quota to exemption. Such exemptions were obtained, and seventeen of the excess, including the numbers from seventy-five to ninety-one, both inclusive, were taken to supply the deficiency. Christian Bomberger’s number was twenty-six beyond the last number of those who were thus taken. Soon after he received notice that he was drafted he made the contract upon which this suit was brought, which was in the following words:—</p>

On the same day Harter appeared <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>before a justice of the peace of Lancaster county, and under oath declared that he had never been sworn into the military service of the United States, that he did not now owe such military service, and that he was willing to become a substitute for Christian Bomberger, who was drafted as a militiaman on the 23d October, A. D. 1862, from the township of Manheim, Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, and intended enlisting in Company A, One Hundred and Fifty-sixth Regiment, Board of Trade, Pennsylvania Volunteers. On the same day he was sworn into the military service of the United States for three years or during the war, as a substitute for Christian Bomberger, of Franklin township, Lancaster county, Pennsylvania, in Company A, Board of Trade Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers, by Lieutenant Martin of that company and regiment, and on the next day was mustered into the service of the United States for the term, and in the regiment above mentioned, at Philadelphia, by Captain Bache, the mustering officer. There can be no doubt that all this was done with the knowledge and approbation of Bomberger, who thought he would thus be exempted for three years. In the course of his service it would appear that Harter was severely wounded in the foot, and was seen in the hospital on crutches. The defendant refused to pay the $600, upon the ground that all this was done by him under a mistake of the law of his case, which was subsequently explained to him by a legal friend. It appears that under the call for'nine months’ men, Bomberger was duly enrolled among the citizens in Manheim township, liable to the draft made in October 1862. The quota of Manheim township was seventy-four, but the commissioners drew an excess in which Bomberger’s name was one hundred and seventeen. The exemptions were seventeen, which, being supplied out of the 'excess, reached only number ninety-one. Bomberger now alleged he was not liable to draft at all, because it was illegal to draw more than the actual quota of seventy-four, and that if he was liable, in any event, he was not actually drawn, and that his substitute went as a three years’ man, and not as a nine months’ militia man. All this may be true, and it may also be conceded that Bomberger acted under a mistake of the law, he supposing no doubt that the enlistment of three years saved him from a draft for that period. But whatever Harter did, was done at the request and solicitation of Bomberger, and with his full knowledge, he promising to pay him $600 when he was accepted by the United States. The whole difficulty has arisen from the anxiety of Bomberger to save himself, and having procured the enlistment of Harter for three years or the war, he now wishes to avoid the payment of the sum of money which he offered as the inducement for Harter to become a soldier, and expose himself to all the dangers and hardships of a military life.</p>
