At the request of James Buckley, Garrett &amp; Martin agreed to advance or pay to Farnum, Newhall &amp; Co. $1000, upon the latter assigning to them one-third of this mortgage. As a further security for the advance of the $1000, Buckley executed his bond, and he and his wife executed the mortgage which is the subject of this suit, under a written agreement specifying its terms.</p>

On the 2d April 1860, an assignment of a one undivided third part of the said mortgage of Buckley &amp; Schofield was executed by Farnum, Newhall &amp; Co. to Garrett &amp; Martin. This assignment, which was placed on record, recited that the sum of $3000 remained due and unpaid, and that the holders, Farnum, Newhall &amp; Co., wanting $1000, the said Garrrett &amp; Martin agreed, at James Buckley’s request, to pay it to Farnum, Newhall &amp; Co., and take an assignment of the said one-third part of the mortgage.</p>

As this policy was assigned as collateral security, so much as was necessary to pay the $1000 with interest would be used for this purpose, and this would be a full answer to this suit. But another fact is introduced by the plaintiffs which is supposed to alter the state of affairs.</p>

The judgment was not to be a lien on the premises afterwards mortgaged by Mrs. Buckley, being her separate property.</p>
    <p id="b282-11" data-blocks='[["BL_282.9",282,[272,1524,1163,473]]]'>The court thought that this judgment varied the question of appropriation of the policy, and no questions were submitted to the jury except whether the plaintiffs appropriated it to the $13,000 judgment, or whether the defendant Buckley had appropriated it to his wife’s mortgage. The first question the court considered the jury decided in the negative, and of this there is no doubt; and they would appear to have decided the other question in the affirmative. The court, however, assume that both were negatived. “ The verdict of the jury,” say the court, “ has determined that no <em>actual </em>appropriation to either debt was made by the parties.”</p>

In the first place this was not a payment of money passing unqualifiedly into the hands of the creditors, and becoming their own property at all events, no matter to what debts it was applied. Such money, if paid, never could be recalled: the only dispute could be what debts did it pay <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>in whole or in part. The policy of insurance was simply a chose in action, assigned to the plaintiffs as a collateral security — not paid as money — that would simply reduce indebtedness, and then its function would be over.</p>
    <p id="b283-6" data-blocks='[["BL_283.4",283,[185,591,1168,421]]]'>The bond of Buckley was given to Garrett &amp; Martin on the 28th March, accompanied by his wife’s mortgage as a collateral security for an undivided third part of a mortgage to be assigned to them. By his bond Buckley became a debtor to Garrett &amp; Martin, and also on the same day made his wife his creditor. When, therefore, on the 31st March, he assigned this policy as collateral security, it was as collateral to his own bond given three days before, and to secure his wife who had become his creditor; and if it had been thus submitted to the jury, their verdict must have been for the defendants.</p>
