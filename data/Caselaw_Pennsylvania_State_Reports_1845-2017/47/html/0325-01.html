Following this, the legislature in the Act of May 10th 1850 authorized the canal commissioners to sell “ the Schuylkill bridge and all that part of the state railroad lying east of the inclined plane, together with all the real estate and old materials upon the part of the Philadelphia and Columbia Railroad, rendered useless by the new road to avoid the Schuylkill inclined plane.”</p>

The following provision of the law manifests this: “ That if the said bridge and railroad lying east of the foot of said inclined plane shall be purchased by any person other than an incorporated railroad company, the governor is hereby authorized to issue letters patent, conferring upon such persons <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>all the rights, privileges, and immunities of a body corporate or politic, subject to all the provisions and restrictions of the act regulating railroad companies, passed the 19th day of February 1849, with a capital stock not exceeding $500,000, divided into shares as provided by said act: And provided further, that the rates of toll to be charged upon said road shall never exceed the rates authorized to be charged upon the Reading Railroad, and in levying said tolls the bridge over the Schuylkill shall be estimated as one mile of the road.”</p>

    <p id="b327-6" data-blocks='[["BL_327.6",327,[165,976,1156,942]]]'>The conveyance contains the following clauses: “ And with the full, free, and absolute right and privilege to the said Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, their successors and assigns, of keeping, using, and maintaining the said railroad, its several tracks, turnouts, sidings, and appurtenances, from the foot of said inclined plane to the eastern terminus, for all railroad purposes, and of using, maintaining, and running thereon their cars, locomotives, and other engines, and the right of furnishing all the motive power to^be used thereon, and of using, managing, and controlling said road, in the same manner the canal commissioners of the said Commonwealth of Pennsylvania have heretofore used, managed, and controlled the same, as fully in all respects as by the above-recorded Act of Assembly the said commissioners are authorized to convey such rights.” “ Together with all and singular the ways, waters, watercourses, rights, liberties, privileges, immunities, franchises, easements, incidents, hereditaments, and appurtenances whatever thereunto belonging or in anywise appertaining, and the reversions and remainders, rents, issues, tolls, emoluments, and profits thereof, and all the estate, right, title, interest, property, privileges, claim and demand whatsoever of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania of, in, and to the same and every part thereof.”</p>

When the state made the road to avoid the inclined plane near the Schuylkill, and authorized the city and districts in the same law to connect with the new road by constructing a railroad across the Schuylkill to meet <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>it, the contract between the city and state was modified, but not rescinded. The state did not by this Act of 1849 provide for any abandonment of the old road from the foot of the inclined plane, or any release of the city from her obligation to continue the road down Broad street from Vine. The Act of 1849, in terms, merely provided for a new road and a new city connection, without superseding those existing. It is true that the Act of 1850 provides for the sale of the old portion as “rendered useless by the new road;” but by its very terms it provided for the continuation of the old road in the hands of the purchasers. At the time of the sale, therefore, to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, there was nothing to indicate any intention to abrogate the contract between the state and the city as to the maintenance of the City'Railroad in any part of it. It is true that since this sale the acts of the state and city very clearly show this intent as to that portion of the City Railroad lying between Olive and South streets.</p>
    <p id="b328-5" data-blocks='[["BL_328.4",328,[300,1166,1154,1146]]]'>The question in this case therefore runs back to the time of the sale, and leads to the inquiry as to what rights vested under it in the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, as the purchasers from the state. This must depend upon the Act of 1850 and the deed of the canal commissioners in pursuance of it. The act we have seen from its very terms imported an intention to continue the use of the part sold as a railroad. This being a main purpose of the law, it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that its connection with the City Railroad was intended to remain. Without it the use of this small piece of road would be measurably worthless to the purchaser, for while no doubt it was hoped that the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company would become the purchasers, the law clearly contemplated that natural persons might purchase, and provided for their incorporation as a railroad company under the General Railroad Law. This intention is strengthened by the minimum price of $200,000 for this part of the road fixed in the act. So the canal commissioners believed when they conveyed as we have already seen, in the language of their deed, conveying the full, free, and absolute right and privilege of using and maintaining the road, and of managing and controlling it in the same manner as heretofore, together with the rights, liberties, privileges, immunities, franchises, easements, and incidents, and the claim and demand of the Commonwealth. Added to this, all parties put upon these acts a practical interpretation, comporting with the same intention, by preserving the connection, and using the roads together for a number of years after the sale.</p>
    <p id="b328-6" data-blocks='[["BL_328.5",328,[300,2323,1151,128]],["BL_329.1",329,[194,424,1156,474]]]'>The connection of the state road with the City Railroad was a <em>right, </em>which the state enjoyed under her contract with the city. It clearly had become an <em>incident </em>to the state railroad, and was <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>a <em>privilege </em>enjoyed by the state when she sold. If this had been a transaction between individuals, no one would doubt that the right to enjoy the connection (which was one of the principal inducements to purchase, for'without it the part sold was worthless except for its property and materials) would pass by the sale. This is abundantly supported by the following authorities: Blaine’s Lessee <em>v. </em>Chambers, 1 S. &amp; R. 169; Pickering <em>v. </em>Stapler, 5 Id. 107; Strickler <em>v. </em>Todd, 10 Id. 69, 70; Swartz <em>v. </em>Swartz, 4 Barr 353; Keiffer <em>v. </em>Imhoff, 2 Casey 439 ; Lefevre <em>v. </em>Lefevre, 4 S. &amp; R. 241; McKillip <em>v. </em>McIlhenny, <a href="/watts/4/0317-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Watts 317" data-case-ids="1842725" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0317-01">4 Watts 317</a>; Campbell <em>v. </em>McCoy, 7 Casey 263.</p>
    <p id="b329-3" data-blocks='[["BL_329.4",329,[196,897,1157,558]]]'>The state made no exception at the time of sale or in the authority for making it. Then certainly there is nothing in this case to exempt the state from the ordinary rules governing sales of property. We must conclude, therefore, that all rights of the state to maintain the connection, and to have the City Railroad continued under the contract with the city for its continuance, passed to the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company as her assignee. As assigns, therefore, the complainants have a right to insist on the maintenance of the City Railroad, and the right of connection as enjoyed by the state before the sale. Nothing short of the exercise of the sovereign power of eminent domain by a <em>talcing, </em>accompanied with compensation, according to the constitution, can defeat the right of the complainants.</p>

Let the decree be drawn up accordingly.</p>
