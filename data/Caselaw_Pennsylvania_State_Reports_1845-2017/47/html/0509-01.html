It was not restricted to purchases of necessaries, as was the interest, but to what might be necessary in cases of urgent necessity occurring in regard to her.</p>

Had she remained of sound mind, and a case of urgent necessity had arisen to which the interest of the bequest would have been inadequate, no one can- doubt but that her interest in it would have been such as to entitle her to call on the trustee for the application of a portion or the whole of the legacy, as the case might require.
