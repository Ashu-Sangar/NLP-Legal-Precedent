The question simply is, whetner nineteen days is three weeks’ notice, or, in other words, whether nineteen days are equal to twenty-one days. Such a decision does not fall far short of an abuse of the privilege which a court has to interpret its own rules. It is not even a question of interpretation of a rule of court, but rather as to the signification of the English words “three weeks,” which clearly mean twenty-one days. As the order was not that notice should be given “ during three successive weeks,” but “ three weeks before” the meeting, we aver, that had the notice been inserted in one English and one German newspaper, published in Lehigh county, but once, twenty-one days before the meeting, this would have been in strict compliance with the order of court; and if this position be tenable, it follows, as a corollary, that any number of insertions in such papers inside of twenty-one days immediately preceding the meeting, would not have been sufficient. Had even the order been, that the notice should be given “ once a week during three successive weeks previous,” &amp;c., which is the language of the Act of Assembly regulating the publications of sheriffs’ sales, three full weeks’ notice would have been necessary.

It does not affect the Act of 1854, but allows additional proceedings to be had, to wit, to have a vote of the qualified electors of the township ordered on the question of election, and <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>a day fixed for the election. But when is this to be done ? Not at the confirmation of the report, as has been contended, because this would interfere with the right of petition for a second commission or review; but only when time has been given under the Act of 1854, for the presentation of a petition for a second commission or review, to wit, until the second term after the confirmation of the report. Only when the rights under the Act of 1854 have been exhausted, can the rights under the Act of 1857 be resorted to. The counsel has likened this to road cases, but the law in reference to them is very different. The approval and fixing the breadth of the road must be one act, or concurrent acts. But the phraseology of the law in relation to the division of townships is very different. “ In proceedings to divide any township in this Commonwealth, it shall be the duty of the Court of Quarter Sessions of the proper county, when a return has been made by commissioners,” &amp;c.</p>

Its plain purpose was to give to all persons interested in the proposed division of the township, a defined period, before the action of the commissioners, to prepare for their meeting. This period was fixed at three weeks. The mode of giving notice was also directed, but not in such a way as to shorten the defined period. The question presented then is, whether a notice given only nineteen or twenty days at most, was a compliance with the order of the court. And clearly it was not. The order was not for notice “during three successive weeks,” nor “by a given number of insertions in newspapers in successive weeks,” but it required a certain duration of time before the time of meeting. It is easy to conceive how the difference may have been important. It may well have been intended to enable absent inhabitants of the township to return in season to interpose objections to the proposed division, while the commissioners were upon the. <a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>ground. It may have been to give full time for the collection of evidence to show that the proposed division was, or was not, advisable. Whatever the reason for making the order was, until it was complied with the commissioners were not authorized to act. We cannot hold that parts of three weeks are the same thing, or substantially the same thing as three weeks, and consequently the failure to give three full weeks’ notice was fatal to the report. See Early <em>v. </em>Homans, <a href="/us/57/0610-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="16 How. 610" data-case-ids="3483808" data-case-paths="/us/57/0610-01">16 How. 610</a>.</p>

It is true that great respect is due to the construction given by a subordinate court to its rules of practice. This order, however, can hardly be called a rule of practice. If it could, it has never been understood that the decision of the lower court in such a case, is conclusive upon us. The contrary has more than once been declared. And when rights of parties rest upon the observance of court rules and orders, as they do in this case, there is every reason why we should hold the court to them. This is especially true -when the rules affect the public, where a new political division of the state is projected. We feel constrained, therefore, to reverse the order of the Quarter Sessions for the reason that the commissioners were not empowered to act until after three full weeks’ notice of the time and place of their meeting had been given.</p>
