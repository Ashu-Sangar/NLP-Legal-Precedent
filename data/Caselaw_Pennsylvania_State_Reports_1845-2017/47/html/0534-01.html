    <p class="summary" id="b535-6" data-blocks='[["BL_535.4",535,[136,669,1171,895]]]'>The witness relied upon to prove a contract, was a brother-in-law of the plaintiff, who testified that in 1851 old Mr. Coover told him he would pay his boys $40, and his girls $20 per annum. That he had said this frequently, and that he had heard him say so in 1853. A daughter of deceased testified, she heard her father say that of those children that worked over age, he was going to pay the boys $40 and the girls $20 per annum; that he said so frequently, and the last time she heard him say so was about twelve years since. Another son-in-law testified, that decedent told him he intended to pay his children for what they worked over age; said he would pay his boys $40 and his girls $20 per year, and their clothes and spending-money, such as they needed, and that he told witness this in 1855. Another witness stated, that in 1856, after the plaintiff was married, old Mr. Coover told her that Mrs. Leidig did not get as much from home as the others, but what she did not get in furniture she should have in money, and what she worked over age she should be paid for. This was all the evidence relied upon to prove a contract; but the father, the deceased, afterwards made his will, in which he distributed his estate nearly equally among all his children.</p>

They may reach farther and disclose his own sense of obligation, and his settled purpose to compensate. But all this <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>is insufficient to raise a promise. The services of a daughter, standing in the relation of Mrs. Leidig to her father, are the results of the relation, not the fruits of a contract. Without a contract expressly made for wages, proven by clear, distinct, and satisfactory evidence, there cannot be a recovery. This has been so often said, it is needless to fortify it by referring to authority.</p>
