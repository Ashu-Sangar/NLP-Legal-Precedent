In the case in hand, as in that, a stay of execution was expressly waived. Without the waiver the parties signing the note would have been entitled to a stay on the judgment entered on the note of six months. We held in the case cited that the <em>proviso </em>to the first section of the act allowing a stay in favour of a soldier, notwithstanding a waiver, was unconstitutional, as impairing the obligation of the contract. The case is directly in point, and rules this one. The stay ordered was wrong, and the order must be reversed.</p>
