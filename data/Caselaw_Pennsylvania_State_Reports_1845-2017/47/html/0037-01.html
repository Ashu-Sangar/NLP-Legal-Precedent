The association was incorporated in 1851, and the mortgagor was a member of it, and a subscriber to ten shares of its stock. Each share entitled him to a loan from the association of $200, and on his ten shares he obtained a loan of $2000, on the 14th of May 1855, for which he paid a bonus of $150. On the same day he gave his bond to the association for $2000, bearing 6 per cent, interest, payable on the second Tuesday in every month. The principal was made payable within three years. To secure this debt with its interest, he executed the mortgage above mentioned, bearing even date with the bond, and at the same time assigned his ten shares of stock to the association as collateral security, which he was required to do by its rules. The rules also required that he should pay an instalment of $1 per month on each share of this stock, which he continued to do until the month of August 1860, inclusive, at which time he had paid $109 on each share, making $1090 in all. His payments of interest on his bond amounted in the aggregate to $650, which was in full to the 14th of August 1860.</p>

On the 10th of the same month the association assigned Becker’s bond and mortgage to Schnepf, for which they received from him the principal sum of $2000, and $230 as arrearages of interest.

Persch <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>himself had an opportunity of contesting the first mortgage.

True, the judgment on the verdict was not entered until afterwards, but there was then <em>lis pendens. </em>The mortgagees of the terre-tenant held his interest, no more. It would be most extraordinary if they are not concluded by the judgment against him in the <em>scire facias. </em>If not, if, after a verdict in a <em>scire facias </em>on a mortgage, the mortgagor or his terre-tenant can, before judgment, open the whole matter again by making a conveyance, or a new mortgage, there may be no end to such a judicial proceeding.
