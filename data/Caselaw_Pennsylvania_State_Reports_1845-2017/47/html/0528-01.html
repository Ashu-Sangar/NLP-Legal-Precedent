After his death they were sold by his executors as part of the assets of his estate. No expense was incurred in collecting the bond first above mentioned, but certain costs, &amp;c., were made in collecting a prior bond and mortgage belonging to the wife, which her trustees had illegally transferred to him as additional collateral security for the same bond.

The defendants, his executors, have, since his death, received interest on one of the said bonds amounting to $3; and on 1st June 1860, sold the four bonds above described to George K. Reed &amp; Co., including the accruing interest for $265. The bonds were payable to bearer, and inventoried as part of John Hatz’s estate. A <em>scire facias </em>issued on the mortgage of John F.

No suit or proceeding was instituted or had on the mortgage of Shroder and wife to John Hatz, above referred to. The proceeds of the sale of the mortgaged premises on the above <em>levari facias </em>having been paid into court, a controversy arose between the plaintiff and the defendants as to the person entitled thereto; and the same having been referred to an auditor, the net proceeds, after deducting costs and expenses of audit, to wit, the sum of $2335.75, was, by his report, awarded to the plaintiff; which report was, on exceptions thereto filed by the defendants, afterwards confirmed by the court, and, finally, on appeal by them affirmed by the Supreme Court. At the time of the sales of the mortgaged premises above referred to, they were in the tenure and possession of tenants of Mrs. Shroder in different parcels at certain yearly rents payable quarterly; and, on the 1st of July 1859, there became due from Mrs. Bolenius, who held by lease from Shroder and wife on one of them, the sum of $50, and from Pettzelt &amp; McAvoy, who held in like manner, $62.50, which sums were paid on being thereto demanded by the said tenants to the defendants without any proceeding having been instituted for the recovery thereof. The costs and expenses incurred by the defendants in attempting to recover the mortgage and bond above stated, exceed the amounts received from the bonds above referred to, and have not been paid, nor has the bond or mortgage to Hatz, above referred to, nor any part thereof, been paid, the said obligor, John F. Shroder, being insolvent. The plaintiff has demanded from the defendants the several amounts received by them from the bonds and rents above set forth, which having been refused, this suit is brought for their recovery. If the plaintiff is entitled to recover the same or any part thereof, then judgment in her favour for such sum as she may be entitled to; otherwise, judgment for defendant.

The expenses which he did incur arose upon an endeavour to collect a prior bond and mortgage, which the trustee of Mrs. Shroder had, by an unauthorized assignment, transferred to him as a collateral security for the payment of the $4500 bond and mortgage. In Hatz’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20210" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Wright 210">4 Wright 210</a>, this court decided that the prior bond and mortgage, assigned by the trustee to Hatz as a collateral security, was illegally transferred to Hatz, and awarded the proceeds of the collection from the mortgaged premises to Mrs. Shroder.</p>

In equity he had no better right, for the debt he undertook to collect was not transferred to him by any authority, of Mrs. Shroder’s, and consequently was not in law or equity held by him as collateral to his own debt. As it regards Mrs. Shroder, he was purely a volunteer in the collection of the prior debt, and could not compel her to refund the expenses.
