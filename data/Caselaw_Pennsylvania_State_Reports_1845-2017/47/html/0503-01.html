It is true her will does not expressly refer to the will of her husband, nor to the power given by it, but it refers to the estate over which the right to exercise the power was conferred. She died seised of no other real estate upon which her will could operate, either as a devise or an appointment. If, then, she had but a life estate, with a power of appointment by deed or will, the direction to her executor to sell the house and lot must fail, if it does not take effect as an execution of the power. But a will is always to be so construed, that it shall take effect in all its parts, if possible. It is always presumed, that a testator intends to insure to his devisee the thing devised. Hence the general rule, that if he has only a power, and not a devisable estate, his devise shall be considered an execution of the power, though it be not referred to in the words by which the gift is made. It is said, indeed, that ther? must be an intention to execute the power, but the existence of <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>such an intention is inferred from the gift of property which the ^testator was incapable of giving, except in execution of the power. Now, the case stated finds, that the house and lot came to the testatrix under the will of her husband, either in fee or for life, with a power of disposition by will, and that she had no other real estate, or power to devise any other real estate. Her will then refers directly to the subject over which she had the power. Her intent that the property should go to the vendee of her executors is plain, and, therefore, her intent to execute the power, of whieh she was a donee, is equally plain, if its execution was necessary to give effect to her principal intent.</p>
