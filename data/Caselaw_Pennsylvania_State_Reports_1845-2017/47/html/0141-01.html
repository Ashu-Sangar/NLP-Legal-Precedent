Weiss, Joel Berlin, Joseph Serfass, and Samuel Hawk to Morris Evans, dated 1st November 1855, upon, a tract of land the title to which afterwards passed into the hands of William H. Speer. On the 5th of November 1855, the mortgage was recorded in the proper record-book in and for Carbon county. The register placed upon the mortgage his certificate to that effect, but neglected to index the recording of the mortgage. The two bonds secured by the mortgage were also entered of record on the same day. Several payments were made upon the bonds, leaving finally unpaid a balance of $2158.10. Before the sale of the property by the sheriff, the judgment-bond which remained unpaid had lost its lien.</p>

On the 20th of August 1861, Speer issued a <em>fi.fa. </em>upon his judgment, and under it on the 30th of September 1861 (inquisition having been waived), the premises were sold to William H. Speer, the plaintiff, and on the 2d day of January 1862, the sheriff executed to him a deed. This <em>sci. fa. </em>was then brought making Speer terre-tenant.</p>

Speer or his counsel, Mr. Albright, that the plaintiff’s mortgage was recorded, and stated publicly then and there the book and page where the same was recorded, and produced the mortgage-book containing the record thereof, that any one interested might see the record if they pleased, then the verdict of the jury ought to be in favour of the plaintiff for the amount of the mortgage yet unpaid.</p>
