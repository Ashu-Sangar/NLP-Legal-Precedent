      <em>“ </em>1. If the contract between these parties for the building in question had been expressly and clearly abandoned by them, they would have been left by their own understanding, as if no contract were made between them, and in that case the plaintiff having erected the building for the defendant, would have been entitled to demand in an action of assumpsit, so much money of the defendant, as his work and services, &amp;c., were reasonably worth. But the question is: Was the written and sealed contract between them actually abandoned ? for, being proved to have been made, it must govern, unless it is clearly and distinctly proved that it was mutually abandoned by them.</p>

Such proof may be established by express evidence that the parties met together and agreed to abandon and throw up the contract, or by positive evidence, that the defendant had expressly admitted, that the written contract was given up and relinquished by him; and, in general, an entire change in the form and purpose of the building (if such change were not comprehended by the terms) would show by implication, that the original contract was abandoned. Where, however, the stipulations of the written contract provide for the changes or alterations alleged to have been made, there is no reason for saying that the contract was abandoned on account of the alterations and changes.</p>

When suit is brought by either party for redress on account of any alleged violation of such contract, it must be founded on the contract, and can be founded on nothing else. The legal remedy in this case being upon the contract between the parties under seal, this action of <em>assumpsit, </em>which ignores the contract under seal, cannot be maintained.</p>

The contract contained <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>two provisions: 1st. “The said John Shaeffer is not to make any extra charges or receive any additional pay, for any change or alteration in the construction of the said building, differing from this agreement, and the specifications and plan or draft made part of it, unless such change or alteration, is agreed upon by the parties thereto in writing, and the price, if any, mentioned in said writing.” The object of this was to prevent those unauthorized alterations which are so apt to be the foundation of extra charges against the owner. The 2d was intended for a case like the present: “ The said Geisenberg, however, reserves the right to have changes made, in the plan or arrangement of the building, he compensating the said Shaeffer for any additional expense incurred thereby, if any.” This is a clear and definite method provided for compensating the plaintiff for any changes of any kind in the building, and covers all the alleged alterations from the written contract, -which are brought forward to show an abandonment of it.</p>
    <p id="b503-6" data-blocks='[["BL_503.4",503,[196,1139,1159,560]]]'>The remedy, therefore, of the plaintiff, was in covenant on the contract, and he would in' that form of action recover all he was entitled to, and there was, therefore, no reason whatever for disregarding the established rule and resorting to an entirely inappropriate form of action. The explanation of this attempt to throw aside the contract and recover on the common counts, is to be found in the fact, that the original estimate of the builder or architect, who drew the plan, of the cost of the building, was $1800, and Mr. Shaeffer contracted to build it for $925. If, therefore, it was ruled, that the contract was abandoned, the plaintiff would be able to recover the full value of the work, without regard to the contract price fixed by the parties. The court were clearly right in all their rulings.</p>
