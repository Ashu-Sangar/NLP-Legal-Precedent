In order to take a case out of the Statute of Limitations the acknowledgment of the debt must be clear and unequivocal, and so distinct and palpable in its extent and form as to preclude doubt or hesitation: a naked admission of indebtedness without indicating the nature or amount of the debt, or a promise to pay something without reference to the sum to he paid, is insufficient.</p>

You still said you would not release us until we pay you the $100. Would you release me if I would give you a note of $50 for my part, payable in six months, with my brother Philip on for security ? I could get along this way. I have no chance to get up. I have a man that would help me up a little, providing I can arrange matters to go in my own name. I do not know whether my brother will even go my security, but I think he will. I have no doubt Huntsberger will do his part also, if he has time, but at present he says he can’t. If you wish to know anything of my brother Philip, inquire by Peter Lefever. I do hope you will give me a chance to get up again.</p>

At most it is but a proposition to secure payment of a certain sum individually, which, instead of operating to establish the entire* joint debt, distinctly proposes it only as a part, severs it from an uncertain remainder, and destroys the joint relation of the defendants. The plaintiff sues for a book account of $179.36, but the letter refers only to some balance of the firm of Wolfensberger &amp; Huntsberger, without indicating what or how much it is. It refers to the fact that the plaintiff had said at some time he would not release the defendants unless they would pay him $100, and then offers to secure part of this sum individually. This proposition was not accepted, so that any acknowledgment to be implied is wholly inferential, and must, to be effective, refer to some specific debt and amount.</p>
    <p id="b517-9" data-blocks='[["BL_517.11",517,[113,1396,1151,340]]]'>But how does anything contained in this letter display an intention to pay a debt of $179.36 standing upon the books of the plaintiff: or in what manner does it ascertain that this is the debt referred to by the term “ balance” ? Balance of what ? The letter does not say. It is a most violent conclusion to draw from this individual proposition to pay $50 of some unexplained balance, an intention of the partnership to pay a book account of $179.36.</p>

It must be so distinct and palpable in its extent and form as to preclude hesitation: Harbold’s Executor <em>v. </em>Kuntz, 4 Harris 210; Suter <em>v. </em>Sheeler, 10 Id. 308.

To the foregoing authorities I may add Emerson <em>v. </em>Miller, 3 Casey 278; Clark <em>v. </em>McGuire, 11 Id. 259; Shaffer <em>v. </em>Shaffer, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%2051" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Wright 51">5 Wright 51</a>.</p>
