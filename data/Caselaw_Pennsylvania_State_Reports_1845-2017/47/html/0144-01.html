Under these statutes it is held that marriage or the birth of a subsequent child is only a revocation <em>pro </em>tanto, and does not affect the will itself, <em>e. g., </em>as to the appointment of executors, the gift to them of a power to sell or the like: Coates <em>v. </em>Hughes, <a href="/binn/3/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Binn. 498" data-case-ids="1791076" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0498-01">3 Binn. 498</a>; McKnight <em>v. </em>Read, <a href="/whart/1/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Whart. 213" data-case-ids="1829031" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0213-01">1 Whart. 213</a>; Walker <em>v. </em>Hall, 10 Casey 483; Young’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20118" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Wright 118">3 Wright 118</a>.</p>

This is substantially the same as the common law rule. We may therefore assume that the decisions at common law so far still apply, and that in this state a provision for future children will prevent the revocation of a will, though made before marriage.</p>
    <p id="b147-7" data-blocks='[["BL_147.5",147,[103,933,1172,345]]]'>In the present case the testator plainly intended to make such a provision which alone would be sufficient, though it should be defeated by the operation of a technical rule of law, or by some external cause, as in the case of a devise of land, the title to which failed, or the gift of stock in a corporation which after-wards became insolvent. But it is sufficient to show that the provision is an effectual one, so that on the death of the appellant, her son will take the estate absolutely, and as a purchaser.</p>
    <p id="b147-8" data-blocks='[["BL_147.6",147,[103,1278,1171,260]]]'>It will be argued on the other side, that the provisions of the will gave to the appellant, under the rule in Shelley’s Case, an estate tail, which, by force of the Act of 1855, became a fee simple. If this were so, the case of Brown <em>v. </em>Thompson, 1 Eq. Cas. Abr. 413, if law, would still apply. But the appellant submits that the rule in Shelley’s Case does not here apply.</p>
    <p id="b147-9" data-blocks='[["BL_147.7",147,[103,1536,1170,729]]]'>I. The intention to give her only a life interest is express, and that interest is qualified in a peculiar way. The trust is not for her use, or even to pay over the rents, issues, and profits to her generally, which would doubtless give her an equitable life estate. It is only, if the executors think proper to sell and pay over the income of the proceeds of sale. It is true, that the testator expresses his desire that the estate should be made to yield an income' immediately after his death; but he still does not deprive his executors of the discretion as to the time of sale, and even the propriety of selling at all. Until a sale, therefore, the appellant has no equitable right whatever. She has no right to the land itself, and not even the power of applying to a court of equity to compel a sale. Hence, her interest is only in the nature of a charge on the estate, the amount of which is to be measured by the discretion of the executors. She has no freehold estate, legal or equitable, within the meaning of the rule in Shelley’s Case.</p>
    <p id="b147-10" data-blocks='[["BL_147.8",147,[104,2266,1167,82]]]'>II. The testator did not use the words “heirs of the body,” in their technical sense, as words of limitation.</p>
    <p id="b147-11" data-blocks='[["BL_147.9",147,[105,2353,1165,86]],["BL_148.1",148,[303,404,1168,175]]]'>1. “ If she shall die leaving issue,” the executors are to convey, &amp;c. These first words are superfluous, if the words <a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>“heirs of the body” are a mere continuation of the previous limitation. On the other hand, if the testator meant the “heirs of the body” to take as purchasers, the words “if, &amp;c.” are technically appropriate to introduce a contingent remainder.</p>
    <p id="b148-6" data-blocks='[["BL_148.4",148,[302,577,1168,514]]]'>2. The previous words “die leaving issue,” coupled with the direction to convey, show that “ issue living at her death” was meant, that is, a specific class of then existing persons, viz., children. Therefore it would seem that the words “ heirs of the body” are to be taken <em>prima facie </em>in the same sense, and not as denoting a series to take in succession. This is made more plain by the fact, that the executors are to convey to “ the heirs of the body,” share and share alike. Now though “heirs of the body” is a technical word of limitation, it may be, and often is popularly used as synonymous with “children” or “issue.” In the present case there is sufficient to show that the testator so used it. If so, of course the rule in Shelley’s Case does not apply.</p>
    <p id="b148-7" data-blocks='[["BL_148.5",148,[302,1093,1167,259]]]'>III. Taking all the limitations together, it is submitted that this is an executory trust, to which the rule in Shelley’s Case does not apply. The whole matter is left in the discretion of the executors.

Cas. in Eq. 1, 77; Edmonson <em>v. </em>Dyson, 2 Kelly 307; Loving <em>v. </em>Hunter, <a href="/tenn/16/0004-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="8 Yer. 4" data-case-ids="8541462" data-case-paths="/tenn/16/0004-01">8 Yerg. 4</a>; Porter <em>v. </em>Doby, <a href="/sc-eq/19/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Rich.

    <p id="b148-8" data-blocks='[["BL_148.6",148,[300,1351,1168,688]]]'>Since the. Act of 1855, converting estates tail into fee simple, the courts should not be too rigid in construing'doubtful words into estates tail. Except so far as decided cases go, the rules which are applied on this subject to personalty ought now to be adopted. These rules were expressly based on this, that an estate tail in personalty amounts to an absolute interest, and therefore the intention of testators would be wholly defeated by the adoption of the stricter doctrines applied to real estate. Therefore, whenever it is possible, the English courts, in doubtful cases, lean to convert bequests to issue, after a life estate, into remainders. See Knight <em>v. </em>Ellis, 2 Brown’s Ch. C. 570; Stoner <em>v. </em>Curwen, 5 Sim. 264; Wynch’s Trust, 27 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. 375; 5 De G. Macn. &amp; G. 188. The same reasons now applying to real estate, it deserves consideration whether it would not be better to secure uniformity of decision, as to both classes of property, by adopting, as far as possible, the rules as to personalty.</p>

It must be administered for the purposes for which it was made; and the safest rule of construction of a will, executed before marriage or birth of issue, is to judge it <em>ex visceribus suis, </em>and nor to depend upon matters <em>dehors </em>the will, and thus defeat the important and recognised rule of certainty in testamentary transmission of property. Did the testator provide by his will for his child ? The solution of this question must determine the case, and it ought to be ascertained by a perusal of the will itself. It certainly provided for the lady, not then his wife, but who subsequently became so, and if this be not a fee tail, and, by the Act of April 27th 1855, a fee simple, he did provide for her children; but the coincidence that the issue was his cannot change the testamentary direction. No better answer to the assumption of the appellants need be given, than the fact that if she shall have more children, all will share under the will, because they are her children. This answers and defeats the argument that he meant his children, for if he meant his children, hers by another husband would not take, and this cannot be here plausibly pretended. Our decisions have been uniform in exacting that there must be a provision for a child, and not something that may stand as an equivalent.</p>

Edwards made his will on the 10th September 1856, devising his estate, real and personal, in trust for the benefit of his friend, Sarah Devitt, and the heirs of her body. On the 11th February 1858, he married Miss Devitt. On the 10th August 1860, he died, leaving his wife <em>enceinte. </em>On the 25th August 1860, a son was born, who is living.</p>
    <p id="b152-7" data-blocks='[["BL_152.5",152,[274,822,1174,686]]]'>Upon this state of facts it is safe and easy to say that the marriage revoked the will as to Mrs. Edwards. The revocation as to her did not depend on the <em>provision </em>made for her, it resulted .absolutely as a legal consequence of the marriage. The statute annexes the condition of <em>provision </em>to the children, not the widow. As to “child or children <em>not provided for </em>in such will,” it is revoked ; but as to children who arc provided for, it is not revoked by the marriage of the testator and birth of issue. The revocation as to the widow, I repeat, was absolute the instant of the marriage. It did not wait for her election, any more than it depended on the provision made for her. And a will revoked is as if it had never been made. The statute plainly declares this to be the effect of revocation; the testator shall be deemed and construed to die intestate, and his estate, so far as concerns the parties in behalf of whom the revocation occurs, is distributable “ as if he had actually died without any will.”</p>

Under the Act of 1833, the marriage of a female after making her will was held a revocation, in Fransen’s Case, 2 Casey 204; and although Walker <em>v. </em>Hall, 10 Casey 483, was not a case of an ante-nuptial will, it was there laid down as settled law, that “if a man makes his will, and marries, and dies leaving a widow, so far as regards the widow he dies intestate, that is, his will is revoked <em>pro </em>tanto, and the widow has a third or half of the real estate during her life, and a third or half of the personal estate absolutely, according to circumstances.” If this be the law of Edwards’s will — if as to his wife he died intestate and without a will — what signifies the learned discussion we bad as to the estate which the words of the will might have vested in her ? These words were repealed after they were written, and as to the widow, they are as if they had never been written. She took neither an equitable nor a legal estate under the will — neither an estate in fee, in tail, nor for life — she took nothing except what the intestate laws gave her. But if <em>she </em>took nothing, how could the posthumous son take anything under the will ? Whatever estate any construction of the will would give him, would be necessarily secondary to that of the mother, either a succession <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>or a remainder, dependent upon a prior estate in her. The court below held that she took an estate tail, which our Act of 1855 converted into a fee, and therefore that the son was unprovided for and that the will was revoked as to him. The inferences are very fair if the premises be granted ; but it is impossible for us to see how she could take an estate tail at the death of her husband if his will was revoked as to her the instant he manned her. And besides, we strongly incline to the opinion that the words of the will, if they were to have effect, would create a life estate in her, with a contingent remainder to the “heirs of her body,” which, in connection with the prior words, “lawful issue,” -we would construe to mean children living at the time of her death. Then the question would arise whether a contingent remainder was such provision as the fifteenth section of our Statute of Wills contemplates, and we should probably conclude that it was not; for we believe the legislature meant a present vested interest, and not a future and contingent one.</p>
    <p id="b153-6" data-blocks='[["BL_153.4",153,[135,1123,1171,687]]]'>But there can be no contingent remainder without a particular estate to support it; and if the mother took nothing under the will, by reason of the revocation, it would be idle to argue that the words were such as would create a life estate in her. Yet without a life estate in her there could be no contingent remainder ; and if a contingent remainder, it was not the statutory provision. View it as we may, we cannot conjure up á doubt that the posthumous son of the testator is a child <em>u not provided for” </em>in the will within the meaning of the Act of Assembly, and therefore his birth was a revocation of the will as to him. Whether the will was wholly inoperative as to the mother, or whether it gave her an estate tail which the statute transmuted into a fee, or an estate for life with remainder in fee to the son, the above conclusion rests on solid ground, and is decisive of the cause. The will is revoked, both as to mother and son, but not necessarily as to the trustees: Coates <em>v. </em>Hughes, <a href="/binn/3/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="3 Binn. 498" data-case-ids="1791076" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0498-01">3 Binn. 498</a>.</p>

Notwithstanding our Act of 24th February 1834, § 13 (Purdon 282), equitable conversion is still a question of intention, and does not result necessarily from a pov'er of sale given to executors : Chew v.
