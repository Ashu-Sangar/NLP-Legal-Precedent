    <p class="summary" id="b364-6" data-blocks='[["BL_364.4",364,[250,617,1162,1535]]]'>The defendant objected to this claim for the reason that the dockets were not so kept as to exhibit good and valid judgments in cases where he had charged for entering judgments. That the judgments not having been entered according to law, and as plaintiff was in duty bound to enter them, he could not therefore recover for his fees, as far as the charges against him personally were concerned; and as to those fees which he had received as attorney for his clients, he could not recover, because he did not receive them, except as the attorney of his clients, the client was responsible and not he; and that at all events, a suit could not be maintained in either class of cases, until a demand had been made upon him for them. The defendant claimed also that he was not liable to pay interest, because costs do not draw interest; and because second, interest cannot be claimed until demand had been made upon him in either class of cases. No note or memorandum was made of the issuing of <em>sci. fa. </em>(of which there were several charged for), when the original was entered in the judgment-docket. So also of executions. Fees 'were charged for judgment-docket entry, when there was no judgment-docket kept. The defendant offered in evidence a judgment in his favour against Chester Cady, which hadbeen entered since the commencement of the “Judgment-Docket F,” and claimed the amount of the judgment and costs should be offset, on the ground that the plaintiff had not entered said judgment on any legal judgment-docket, so that it could be enforced against purchaser or mortgagees; and second, that he had not brought forward on to the judgment-docket a large bill of costs, which said costs he claimed should be offset also. Defendant also offered in evidence another judgment which he claimed should be offset, because there was no date at all of its entry either in the record or margin. Defendant also offered in evidence the record of an ejectment for two tracts of land, upon which a conditional verdict was returned for the purchase-money, which amounted to $559.66. On the 23d October 1855, one tract of this land belonged to plaintiff and the other to defendant, and defendant was compelled to pay all the purchase-money to save his own lot.</p>

Mr. Donaldson has been prothonotary since 1845, the year that Mr. Cone was admitted to the bar. The difficulty in this case has originated, in a system of credit, instead of cash, which, however inconvenient to the gentlemen of the bar, should be strictly adhered to, and what proves that this should be the practice is, that one of the bars to the recovery of the state taxes set up by the defendant is, that the plaintiff should have demanded and received them when the original writs were issued.</p>
    <p id="b365-16" data-blocks='[["BL_365.18",365,[214,2350,1156,130]],["BL_366.1",366,[318,470,1153,346]]]'>There are eighteen bills of exception and twenty-four specifications of error, and a verdict for $390.17, and it is stated in the defendant’s counter-statement that the plaintiff’s evidence <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>consisted of, <em>inter </em>alia, the records and docket entries of costs in about two hundred suits in which the defendant himself was plaintiff, or plaintiff in interest. The plaintiff in error’s paper-book is confused, and in several important particulars shown to be erroneous by the counter-statement of the defendant in error. We cannot therefore be expected to deal in detail with these multitudinous specifications, but shall proceed to state some principles which dispose of them in classes.</p>
    <p id="b366-6" data-blocks='[["BL_366.4",366,[317,814,1153,597]]]'>We hold the state taxes on original writs and other proceedings, imposed by the 3d section of the Act of April 6th 1830, Brightly’s Purd. 956, to be constitutional, and that the prothonotary having paid them, was entitled to sue for and recover them in this suit. That the defendant was personally liable to him for all fees due him in suits in which he was the plaintiff, or the plaintiff in interest, and for all fees due the prothonotary received by him, either as attorney or client. That if the prothonotary has performed the services, but has not in all instances literally complied with the letter of the law, he is entitled to his fees, and if the defendant has sustained any damage, which is nowhere alleged on the record, his remedy is by action. There is no proof in this case that Mr. Cone ever lost a single cent by any neglect imputed to Mr. Donaldson.</p>
    <p id="b366-7" data-blocks='[["BL_366.5",366,[316,1405,1154,516]]]'>The claim to set off the money paid to relieve the land purchased by the defendant from the effect of the verdict in ejectment, <em>pro rata, </em>according to the relative value of the two lots, is entirely unfounded. The equitable owner of the two lots, sold the one subsequently purchased by Mr. Donaldson for its full value, and gave a deed of general warranty; the other lot remained in the possession of the equitable owner, and was, of course, in equity bound for the whole of the unpaid purchase-money. After the death of the owner this lot was sold, and purchased by Mr. Cone, who, when he paid the amount of the conditional verdict, had no recourse, either in law or equity, to Mr. Donaldson, the owner of the lot first sold.</p>
    <p id="b366-8" data-blocks='[["BL_366.6",366,[316,1924,1153,386]]]'>The charge of the court upon the subject of a demand, and the allowance of interest, seems to be as favourable as the defendant could ask, and we see nothing in any of the specifications of error requiring a more special notice. We hope that this unwise system of credit, and of mutual accounts of fees and costs between the different officers of the courts, will be stopped, and that we shall not be again favoured with the recapitulation of such numerous suits in any court in which one of its officers figures in the character of plaintiff.</p>
