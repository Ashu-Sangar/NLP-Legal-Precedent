On the morning of the 6th of July, being distant about two hundred and fifty miles from the Nantucket Shoals, they fell in with a full-rigged brig, which at first hoisted French colours. Upon nearing the John Welsh, she hauled down the French flag, and hoisted what was supposed to be the secession flag, and fired a shot at the plaintiff’s vessel. The John Welsh hove to, and was boarded from a boat sent by the stranger, the boarders not carrying their arms openly, but concealed in their boots and drawers. The man in command of the boat demanded the papers of the John Welsh from her captain, which were given to him; and then gave the witness to understand that he had full charge of the vessel. The boat’s crew went all over the vessel, plundering whatever they thought proper to take. The crew of the John Welsh was then transferred to the stranger vessel; the captain of the John Welsh, the witness, the steward, and a boy remaining on her. A prize crew was brought back to the John Welsh, and then her captain, the witness, the steward, and boy were removed to the stranger. The John Welsh then filled away, proceeding in a southerly direction, and wras never seen or heard of afterwards. The stranger vessel carried five guns, and was strongly armed, having from ninety-five to one hundred men. They alleged no authority for the capture, nor did they say what they were, only that they were going to capture all the Northern vessels they could come across. The witness described them as pirates, who robbed him on the high seas. After the John Welsh was taken, the stranger subsequently attacked and took several vessels; among others, the Enchantress, and a ship called the Mary Gooddell, in which vessel the witness returned to Maine. The stranger vessel had three or four different names. Some of her crew called her the Putnam, some the Jeff Davis, and some, another name. She had no name painted on her, and was an American built and rigged vessel, which her crew said had come <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>from Charleston.

On the 6th July, being about two hundred and fifty miles from the Nantucket shoals, she was captured by a stranger vessel, which floated French colours when first seen, but which ran up the secession flag before the capture, and which proved to be the privateer Jeff Davis, cruising under letters of marque issued by authority of the so-called Confederate States. The Jeff Davis subsequently captured the Enchantress, and afterwards her crew were themselves captured and brought to Philadelphia, where, under the name of William Smith and ■others, they were indicted, tried and convicted, but not sentenced, for piracy, in the Circuit Court of the United States. Their offence was laid as committed against the Enchantress, not the John Welsh. By direction of the President of the United States they were subsequently exchanged with the Confederate States as prisoners of war.</p>

In passing upon this question we are authorized and requested by counsel on both sides to make use of the printed <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>report of Smith’s trial, and of “the history of the times.” It appears from the evidence on Smith’s trial, that the Congress of the Confederate States had authorized the President of that so-called government to issue, to private armed vessels, letters of marque and general reprisal, and that in pursuance of such authority, commissions and instructions had been issued to the crew of the Jeff Davis, and that she was sailing under this authority when the John Welsh was captured. These instructions pointed to a war on the commerce of the United States alone, and enjoined the strictest regard to the rights of all neutral powers.</p>
    <p id="b169-6" data-blocks='[["BL_169.4",169,[106,895,1177,1288]]]'>A pirate is usually defined as <em>Jiostis humani </em>generis, but a more accurate description of the offence of piracy is that it is robbery or forcible depredation upon the sea, <em>animo fur andi. </em>It is usually contrasted with captures <em>jure belli, </em>as in the case of The United States <em>v. </em>Klintock, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wheat.%20150" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Wheat. 150">5 Wheat. 150</a>. The distinction between privateering and piracy is the distinction between captures <em>jure belli </em>under colour of governmental authority and for the benefit of' a political power organized as a government <em>de jure </em>or <em>de facto, </em>and mere robbery on the high seas committed from motives of personal gain, like theft or robbery on land. In the one instance the acts committed enure to the benefit of the commissioning power, and in the other to the benefit of the perpetrators merely. By the Constitution of the United States, Congress is authorized to define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and several Acts of Congress have been passed upon the subject from 1790 down to 1861. See Brightly’s Digest of U. S. Statutes. Privateering, on the other hand, has in all our history been claimed and defended as lawful warfare on public enemies. It is the substitute for enormous naval establishments. It was largely practised in our revolutionary struggle, is expressly recognised in the Federal Constitution, and when the principal maritime powers of Europe declared at the Congress of Paris in 1856, that “privateering is and remains abolished,” we refused to accede to the declaration, and the state papers of the time, from the pens of General Cass, our minister to France, and of the late Judge Marcy,‘then secretary of state, contain the most unanswerable arguments against the surrender of our right of privateering. As late as the 3d March 1863, Congress authorized the President to issue letters of marque and reprisal “ in all domestic and foreign wars.”</p>

If the Jeff Davis was not a privateer she was a pirate, and if she was a privateer she was made so by the commission she bore. The legal effect of that commission, therefore, must depend upon the <em>status </em>of the South-<a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>urn Confederacy. That it is a government <em>de </em>jure, no man who is faithful to the Constitution of the United States will for a moment contend. But is it not a government <em>defacto ?</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.4",170,[333,551,1167,819]]]'>I do not find this kind of government sharply defined in any writers on public law, but I suppose that any government, however violent and wrongful its origin, which is in the actual exercise of sovereignty over a territory and people'large enough for a nation, must be considered as a government <em>de facto. </em>Yattel tells us that any nation which governs itself under what form soever without any dependence on foreign power, is a sovereign state. And our American ideas will accept from foreign nations no other authentication of the right to rule, than the fact of ruling. General Jackson, in his message of December 1836, in setting forth the uniform policy and practice of this government to recognise the prevailing party-, in all foreign disputes, told Congress that “ all questions relative to the government of foreign nations, whether of the old or new world, have been treated by the United States <em>as questions of fact only.” </em>And this sentiment has been repeated numberless times in our state papers. There is no doubt, therefore, that the Federal Government is accustomed to concede, not only belligerent rights, but civil authority also, to governments <em>defacto.</em>

    <p id="b170-7" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[332,1368,1168,642]]]'>Nor does it appear that an interval of peace is essential to the constitution of a government defacto, as was argued. The time of recognising a new power is decided by each existing government for itself, and it may be delayed by the fact that the new power has had no peace, and a season of peace may be indispensable also to consolidate its administration ; but where, as here, the inquiry relates merely to the <em>existence </em>of the new power, it would be very difficult to say that it did not exist, because it did not exist in peace. To make war is one of the highest attributes of sovereignty, and quite as demonstrative evidence of vital existence as deeds of peace. The original thirteen states confederated in 1777, but did not achieve peace until 1783, and during those six years were in constant war, yet who doubts now— who ever did doubt — that in all that interval they were a government <em>de facto ?</em>

Certain states having acceded to the Federal Union with other states under a constitution, perpetual and irrepealable, except by common consent, did in 1860 and 1861, without the consent of the other states, and in flagrant violation of the Federal compact, secede from that Federal Union and confederate together under the name of the Confederate States of America, and set up over themselves, in a written constitution, a general government, whose seat or capital is the city of Richmond, and whose asserted jurisdiction <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>is co-extensive with the territories of the seceded states. I have never seen their constitution, but I understand it resembles our own in many points, and that it establishes all the departments and functionaries of a regular republican government. It is a very unquestionable part of the history of the times that this government has carried on war, offensive and defensive, for more than three years, and that its belligerent rights have been recognised by the principal states of Europe, though, as a civil power, it has not obtained recognition by any of the nations of the earth.</p>
    <p id="b171-6" data-blocks='[["BL_171.4",171,[131,850,1168,214]]]'>Now, when we find such a government actually exercising sovereignty over a territory larger and a people more numerous than those of our original thirteen states, is it possible that, if the <em>status </em>of that government must be declared, anything less can be said of it than that it is a government <em>de facto ?</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b171-7" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[126,1065,1174,1378]],["BL_172.1",172,[313,428,1163,217]]]'>Obvious as the answer to this question may seem to be, it encounters, nevertheless, this serious difficulty. If secession did not dissolve the Union, as to the seceded states, and place them beyond the pale of the Constitution, then they are still under the Constitution, which in its tenth article declares that “no state shall enter into any treaty, alliance, or <em>confederation ; grant letters of marque and reprisal, </em>coin money, emit bills of credit,” &amp;c. &amp;c. How can they be a <em>de facto </em>government any more than a government <em>de jure </em>under the Constitution of the United States ? How can two sovereignties co-exist for the samé purposes, any more than two magnitudes can occupy the same space at the same time ? The Federal Government and the state governments, both sovereign in their respective spheres, can co-exist over the same people, because governmental purposes and powers are divided between them, and so long as they exercise only the powers which they respectively-possess under the Constitution, they move in harmonious orbits. Thoughtless men sometimes allege that people cannot be subject to two sovereignties, and thence infer that state sovereignty is a doctrine subversive of the just authority of the Federal Government; but if they would look upon their children, who are subject to one sovereignty at home and to another in school, they would see the riddle solved, and would learn how governments, existing for different purposes and clothed with different powers, may both be sovereign to the extent of their respective powers and to the advantage of those who are subject to both jurisdictions. But the Confederate Government exists for the <em>same purposes, </em>within the seceded states, for which the Federal Government was established, and hence the inconsistency. The one must displace the other. If the Federal Government, who alone has power under our constitution to issue letters of marque and reprisal, still exists in the seceded states, however its functions may be hindered and suspended, I see not <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>how the government of the Confederate States can have power to issue letters of marque and reprisal. It is a governmental power expressly lodged with the Federal Government, and unless secession has had the effect to withdraw it, there it exists still in all the plenitude and exclusiveness of the original grant.</p>
    <p id="b172-6" data-blocks='[["BL_172.4",172,[313,642,1164,648]]]'>The legal consequences of secession, in this particular, have not been distinctly and authoritatively declared. Sometimes secession is treated as a nullity, and the acts and ordinances of secession are ignored. According to this view the Southern States are still integral portions of the Federal Union, and all that has happened within them is mere insurrectionary resistance of the constitution and laws of the United States. If this be so, it must follow that the United States is the supreme government over the seceded territory, for its appropriate purposes, both <em>de jure </em>and <em>de facto </em>— its functions indeed temporarily suspended in certain districts, but its existence unimpaired. This view seems to me as fatal to the <em>de facto </em>pretensions of the Confederate States as to the rightfulness of their dominion. Assuredly they have no right to issue letters of marque and reprisal, if another government, clothed with the exclusive right, exists among them.</p>
    <p id="b172-7" data-blocks='[["BL_172.5",172,[312,1289,1167,419]]]'>The other view of secession is that it was a revolution which took the seceded states entirely out of the Union, and made them, in respect to the Federal Government, foreign states. In the language of a distinguished Congressional leader, “ having organized a distinct and hostile government, they have by force of arms risen from the condition of insurgents to the position of an independent power <em>defacto </em>— the Constitution and Union are abrogated so far as they are concerned, and, as between two belligerents, they are under the laws of war and the laws of nations alone.”</p>
    <p id="b172-8" data-blocks='[["BL_172.6",172,[311,1718,1169,720]]]'>These are the two views of secession on which the public men of the country divide, and between which some of them oscillate. Which shall the judicial mind adopt? I answer, that view, if it can be ascertained, which the political departments of the Federal Government have adopted. Not that the judiciary is ever, upon principle, to surrender its independence of judgment to the executive and legislative departments, but, since the foreign relations of the Federal Government are wholly intrusted to the President and Congress, the judiciary must accept them, just as they have been recognised and established by the President and Congress. It is only from the acts and declarations of these departments that we can know, judicially, what governments exist, and what rights we concede to them. This rule of decision was recognised by Ch. J. Marshall, in United States <em>v. </em>Palmer, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wheat.%20634" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Wheat. 634">3 Wheat. 634</a>, and in Foster <em>v. </em>Nielson, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pet.%20307" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Pet. 307">2 Peters 307</a>, and was very' distinctly reasserted by Mr. Justice Grier, in the Prize Cases, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Black%20670" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Black 670">2 Black 670</a>.</p>

Fortunately such a generalization is not necessary for the purposes of this particular case, because we have a fact here which is decisive of this case, however inconclusive it might prove in a larger application in connection with other facts. I allude to the fact' that, after the conviction of the crew of the Jeff Davis for piracy in a court of justice, the President interposed and restored them to the authorities of the Confederate States. The depredations upon the Enchantress, for which they were convicted of piracy, were the same in character and legal effect as those committed against the John Welsh. The capture of one vessel was no less piratical than the other. Guilty of piracy, the President might have pardoned them for reasons of state, but he did not — he treated them as public enemies, and thus, in this instance, recognised the belligerent rights of the power that sent them forth, and the validity of the commission under which they sailed. No declaration could be more emphatic that they were not pirates, and because it came from that department to whom it is our duty to look for a definition of our relations with all surrounding powers, whether friends or enemies, we accept it and follow it instead of the judicial proceeding which resulted in the conviction of piracy.</p>

I would not infer from it alone, that the President meant to recognise the Southern Confederacy even as a government <em>de facto, </em>nor that he considered secession a revolution that placed the states outside of the Union, and I have no doubt that as a measure of policy it was dictated by motives of prudence and humanity ; but in its bearing upon this particular case I cannot doubt that it was a recognition of the authority under which the Jeff Davis sailed. If all other vessels sailing under the same authority should be considered piratical, nay, if this very cruiser should hereafter be so considered and treated, yet, for the time present, and as to the transaction now under investigation, I must regard the capture of the John Welsh as a capture <em>jure belli </em>and not piratical. That deference which is due to the constituted authorities of the country demands this conclusion.

The contract was in one of the ordinary forms of a peace policy. The clause descriptive of the perils insured against was as follows: “ Touching the adventures and perils which the said insurance company are contented to take upon them in this voyage,they are of the seas, fires, pirates, rovers, assailing thieves, jettison, barratry of the master or mariners, unless the assured be owner or part owner of the vessel (embezzlement and illicit trade excepted in all cases), and all other perils, losses, or misfortunes that have or shall come to the detriment or damage of the said vessel, freight or property, or any part thereof.” Then followed a proviso not necessary now to be <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>noticed, and a second in these words : “ And provided also that the said company shall not be liable for any claim for, or loss by seizure, capture, or detention, or the consequences of any attempt thereat.” The effect of this proviso was to restrain the generality of the description of perils against which the defendants undertook to insure. It introduced an exception, and exempted the insurers from all liability for losses arising from any of the enumerated or non-enumerated causes before mentioned, if, within the understanding of the parties, they were seizure, capture, detention, or consequences of any attempt thereat.</p>

On the morning of the 6th of July, in that year, she fell in with a strange brig which at first hoisted French colours, but afterwards ran up the secession flag and compelled her to come to. She was then boarded by armed men from the strange vessel, her' papers were demanded, plundered of what the strangers thought proper to take, and taken posession of as a prize. A prize crew was put on board, her own crew was removed to the strange vessel, and the captured vessel sailed away and has never since been heard from. The brig which made the capture proved to be the Jeff Davis, and was then cruising under letters of marque issued in pursuance of pretended authority of the so-called Confederate States. After the capture of the John Welsh, the Jeff Davis captured another vessel called the Enchantress, and her crew were themselves subsequently captured, brought into the port of Philadelphia, indicted for piracy, tried and convicted. The offence was laid as having been committed against the Enchantress. No sentence was adjudged after the conviction, but by direction of the President of the United States the accused persons were exchanged as prisoners of war.</p>

Whether it was piracy at common law depends upon the answer to be given to another question, which is, whether the letters of marque under which the Jeff Davis sailed were available to change the character of the acts done by her crew, and give to them a legal significance, which, without the letters, they would not have had. But I apprehend this case is not to be determined by any answer that may be given to the question whether the capture of the John Welsh was an act of piracy, as <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>defined by our Acts of Congress, or piracy according to the laws of nations. If the loss was caused by seizure, or capture, it matters not whether the capture was lawful or unlawful, made by a recognised belligerent <em>jure belli, </em>or made without any legitimate authority, even by a pirate. The defendants are not liable on this policy for any loss by capture of any description, though it may be called by another name. Had they insured against capture, they would have been equally responsible whether the capture was rightful or wrongful, <em>jure belli, </em>or <em>contra jwem belli, </em>whether made by a public enemy or a neutral power, or made without any pretence of right at all. See Arnould on Insurance, vol. 2, 808; Marshall on Insurance 394. And when losses by capture are excepted from the risk assured, the excepted losses must equally extend to captures of every description. Now I admit that the word “ capture,” when used in a policy of marine insurance, most frequently presents the idea of a seizure by a government, a recognised member of the family of nations. Such seizures are much more numerous than all others, and they are very common when the country is at war, or when Avar exists between tAvo other nations. The clause by w'hich underwriters assume the risk of captures is peculiarly appropriate to Avar policies, and is not found in peace policies, unless introduced negatively to limit liability to the assured. But the authorities show that wherever used, the meaning of the word “ capture,” in a policy is not confined to forcible seizure of property on the high seas by the act of governments, and to lawful taking by belligerents. It is not the character of the agent, hut the nature of the thing done, which determines whether the act is a capture. Such are the definitions given in the best elementary treatises, and such are the decisions of the courts. A very large number of these definitions are collected by Chief Justice Bigelow in the opinion of the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in Dole <em>et al. v. </em>The New England Mutual Insurance Company, <a href="/mass/88/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="6 Allen 373" data-case-ids="2124636" data-case-paths="/mass/88/0373-01">6 Allen 373</a>. I shall not cite them at large, but I refer to them as cited in that case. They show incontestably that in policies of insurance theAvord “capture” means any forcible taking out of the possession of an owner, whether lawful or not, by Avhomsoever the act is committed, and that it includes a piratical taking, as well as one made by a government, or <em>jure belli. </em>I speak of capture unqualified, as it is used in the exceptions made in the policy issued by these defendants. If, as is often the case, it he described as a capture by kings, princes, and people of governments, the construction is more limited. The decisions of the courts also sustain the definitions given by the elementary writers. Assurers have been held liable on their policies assuming the risk of capture when the taking of the subject insured was made not by a government, either <em>defacto </em>or <em>de jure, </em>nor by any belligerent. And in some well-considered <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>cases it has been held not essential to a capture that the taking should be by external force. In McCargo <em>v. </em>The New Orleans Insurance Co., 10 Robert (La.) 202, the loss of a slave cargo by insurrection of the slaves was held to be covered by an insurance against “capture.” That was an undoubted case of piracy, but it was also capture. In Powell <em>v. </em>Hyde, 5 Ellis &amp; Blackburne 607 (85 Eng. Com. Law Reps.), goods were warranted “free from capture and seizure, and the consequences of any attempt thereat.” The risks insured against were enumerated as “ of the seas, men-of-war, fire, enemies, pirates, jettisons, letters of marque and countermart, surprisals, taking at sea, arrests, restraints, and detainment of all kings, princes, or people of what nation, condition, or quality whatsoever.” The British vessel insured passed within gunshot of a Russian fort, and was fired into and sunk, when there was no war between Great Britian and Russia. It appeared to the court from all the facts that the object of the Russians was to detain the ship. The arrest was without right and without any governmental authority. Yet it was held that the exception introduced by the warranty was not confined to legal capture, but that an illegal seizure was within both the enumerated perils and the exceptions. Hence the insurers were ruled not liable. Lord Campbell declared as his opinion that the word “ capture,” in the warranty, was not confined to lawful capture, but included any capture in consequence wdiereof the ship was lost to the assured. And in Kleinwort <em>v. </em>Shepard, 5 Jurist N. S. 863, where the question was, whether the taking of a vessel by mutinous coolie passengers was a capture within the meaning of a warranty “free from capture or seizure,” Lord Campbell declared that such a warranty is not confined to war risks, or belligerent seizures, and added, “ we clearly think it would extend to a capture or seizure by pirates.”</p>

Let it be that the taking was an act of piracy, both under the Act of Congress and at common law. It was more. The underwriters undertook against such piracies only as were not captures. In the light of the cases referred to, as well as in the light of common sense, the seizure of the John Welsh had all the essentials of a capture. The history of the times, which by agreement has been made part of the evidence, shows that after the policy was issued to the plaintiff, a number'of the states belonging to the Federal Union attempted to withdraw from it, adopted pretended ordinances of secession, confederated together under the forms of a new government, and agreed to a WTitten constitution that made <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>provision for executive, legislative, and judicial departments, similar in many respects to those created by the Constitution of the United States. It is also a fact that this pretended government went into operation, that it has enforced obedience to its authority over large regions of country and over many millions of people; that it has by force excluded temporarily the operation of the laws of the United States; that its courts are the only courts which in large districts attempt to hold sessions; that it levies and collects taxes, raises armies, borrows money, and does all the acts which are done by legitimate governments. It is also a fact that this confederacy has, since the month of April 1861, been carrying on a war of large proportions against the government of the United States, and that our own government has in many ways recognised the contest as a civil war. I think it would be affectation to deny that the contest which has been raging for more than three years is a war, not an external but a civil war. What then is this thing, thus carrying on a war, subjecting millions of men to its formally-organized power, and excluding by force the operation of any other lawrs than its own ? A government <em>de jure </em>it certainly is not. All its acts are in gross violation of right. It is nowhere a recognised government. It has never been admitted into the family of nations. But though it is not a rightful government, does it not exist as a government <em>de facto ? </em>Is it not in fact performing the functions of a government ? I am not now inquiring whether our government, or any other is to be affected by any of its acts, or whether it can confer any authority which we must recognise. The question now is, as to the existence of a fact, not what will be the consequence if the fact be conceded. I cannot doubt that these revolting states, confederated as they have been, claiming and enforcing authority, as they have done, are to be regarded as a government <em>defacto. </em>This is not conceding to them any rights as a government, not even the right to carry on war either on sea or land. Nor do I think they are any less a government <em>defacto, </em>because they have had no interval of peaceful existence, if they have effectually excluded the rightful government, though the exclusion be but temporary, I cannot see that their continuing to carry on a war alters the fact that they do claim, exercise, and enforce governmental authority over large bodies of people and extensive districts of country. Nor do I perceive that they are any the less a government <em>de facto </em>because the geographical boundaries of the district over which their power is exclusively felt are not well defined. It is not essential to the existence of any government, either rightful or usurping', that it be possible to trace accurately the line of division between the territory over which it claims to exercise dominion, and the territory of an adjoining power. There is more than one government now in <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>existence recognised as such, the territory of which it is impossible to define.</p>
    <p id="b179-6" data-blocks='[["BL_179.4",179,[107,541,1169,1718]]]'>I repeat that though the Confederate States are a government <em>defacto, </em>it does not follow that they have any rights as such, or can confer any authority which we or any other nation are bound to recognise. The admission of existence in fact is no concession of right. But the fact is important in determining whether the taking of the John Welsh was a capture. The vessel was taken under an authority derived from this power, pretending to be a government. It matters not that the taking was justified by no law, not even by those of war. As has already been said, it is not essential to' a capture that it be made by any right. Many seizures have been held captures that had no pretence or justification, and some that were after-wards disavowed. What other difference can there be between a seizure made by such a power as the Confederate States, and a seizure by a recognised government, except this, that the one may be lawful, and the other cannot be ? I cannot bring my mind to doubt that the taking of the John Welsh in the manner in which she was taken, and under the direction or authority of this <em>de facto </em>government, though it was an usurpation, was a capture within the meaning of the defendant’s policy, and hence it was a risk which they did not assume. And such was manifestly the understanding of the parties. The one exacted and the other paid no premium for anything more than such hazards as exist in time of'peace. The risks common in time of war the defendants were not asked to assume, but they did undertake to indemnify against acts of pirates, not amounting to captures. It is one thing to insure against the acts of rovers, plunderers and freebooters on the seas, assailants who act in small bodies, who are unsupported by any considerable force, and whose assaults are less probable because the world is at enmity with them, and quite another thing to insure against the acts of a government in form, fitting out privateers and carrying on war. The hazard of loss in the one case is far less than in the other. And the latter risk is not diminished by the fact that the war is an unjust one, and that those in arms against the government have no right to make the capture. Now-it was the extent of the hazard that the parties sought to fix by the language of the policy. They could not have used more fit words to negative responsibility for such an act as was the seizure of the John Welsh, than those they have employed in the excepting proviso.</p>

In discussing this question, it is to be recollected that the authorities cited relate almost exclusively to what foreign nations may consider as the law of nations by which they may regulate their conduct, in relation to the legitimate government and its rebellious subjects or citizens.

The country and the people embraced by this unholy rebellion are simply in a state of rebellion and are rebellious citizens, but at the same time they are enemies, and may be treated as such. They may be tried as traitors and pirates, and may under the laws of the United States be convicted and punished as such, and no man or nation could complain of it as an unjust or illegal act. This is the strict law, and therefore when the citizens of the United States who committed this depredation and robbery on the high seas, were tried and convicted as pirates by the Circuit Court of the United States, no one could dispute the justice and validity of the proceedings. But when a rebellion assumes such gigantic proportions as the present one, the lawful government cannot from motives of policy and humanity act upon strictly legal principles, but must <em>ex necessitate rei </em>adopt so much of the practice of civilized warfare, as would prevent indiscriminate slaughter, and the infliction of unnecessary pain and hardship. This leads necessarily to exchange of prisoners, whether on land or sea, the government waiving its legal rights, without in any manner recognising the rebel leaders, or their organization, but constantly denying them to be a government <em>de facto </em>or <em>de jure, </em>or as possessing the powers to issue letters of marque and reprisal, or to fit out privateers, or armed vessels, or to make captures, or to establish prize courts which could condemn as legal prizes the vessels captured by their cruisers. Lord Coke’s description of war is very apposite : “ so when by invasion, insurrection, rebellion, or such like, the peaceful course of justice is disturbed and stopped, so as the courts of justice be as it were shut up, <em>et silent leges ínter arma, </em>then it is said to be time of war.” All rebellion or insurrection is in reality war, and it becomes more evidently such, when it brings hundreds of thousands of men into the field. Still it is only a rebellion, and the citizens of the rebellious portion are only rebellious citizens, over whom the government possesses not only all its legal rights, but all those powers which a state of war confers upon it. This I think was the view taken in the dis<a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>cussion of the constitutionality of the draft law.

Here I must pause to notice the fallacy of any argument which, presenting a single alternative between the continued Federal sovereignty, and a substitution of Confederate sovereignty, by means of revolution and dissolution, and alleging as a fact, the admission of the latter by the political departments of the Federal Government, brings as the proof of it, the alleged concession of <em>belligerent rights. </em>The yielding of certain temporary benefits to rebels in arms, to moderate the rigours of war — a condition produced by the violence of force — differs essentially from the concession of a <em>de facto </em>governmental status to the rebels themselves — a concession demanding, according to the presented alternative, an admission of sovereignty. The substitution of the expression “belligerent rights,” in order to draw the inference from their concession, that the Federal Government, therefore, regards “ secession as a revolution which dissolved the Union,” leads to error. Belligerent rights arise from a state of war, and not necessarily from any governmental <em>status. </em>Civil war may exist without separation, or distinct sovereignty. It begins between members of the state, and the government, opposed in its own domain, does not concede successful revolution or separate sovereignty, by awarding belligerent rights to the rebels. A state <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>of civil war undoubtedly exists, and a corresponding necessity to treat the rebels according to the usages of civilized warfare; but it does not follow that this is a concession of a <em>defacto </em>status to the government under which the rebels prosecute their rebellion. The Federal Government, on the contrary, has uniformly and persistently denied it. Excepting the exchange of prisoners, and the application of the law of prize to Federal captures of vessels violating the blockade, not a solitary governmental act has been pointed to, as a recognition of the Confederate status; and these, it will be shown, fail of the purpose aimed at.</p>

When and in what way has any department of our government conceded to the Confederacy a position outside of the Constitution and Union, and the possession of the actual governing power within any point of the territory of the Union ? If we have exchanged prisoners, it was but the exercise of humanity to loyal citizens, and not a concession to a separate government. If we have blockaded their ports and applied the law of prize to Federal captures, one was but as a means of warfare, and the other a concession to the rights of neutrals.</p>

An exchange of prisoners simply grows out of a state of war, and its effect as an act, can rise no higher than its producing cause.

If therefore, we choose to apply the -law of prize to our own captures, and thus escape collisions with other nations, it is but an act collateral to the blockade, as a means of warfare.

Had this question been before the court, I doubt not Justice Grier, who delivered the opinion, would have adhered to his own judgment in the case of these pirates. His language is worthy of reproduction, for its clear and terse statement of the whole question. “ Every government is bound by the law of self-preservation to suppress insurrections, and the fact that the number and power of the insurgents may be so great as to carry on a civil war against their legitimate sovereign, will not entitle them to be considered a state. The fact that a civil war exists for the purpose of suppressing a rebellion, is conclusive evidence that the Government of the United States refuses to acknowledge their right to be considered such. Consequently, this court, sitting here to execute the laws of the United States, can view those in rebellion in no other light than traitors to their country; and those who assume, by their authority, a right to plunder the property of our citizens on the high seas, as pirates and robbers.”</p>

Indeed, in the absence of the proviso against capture, it can scarcely be supposed that this intent even lurked under the expressions “pirates, rovers, and assailing thieves.” But in view of the exception, it seems to me clear that the policy never was designed to insure against this then unknown, great, and imminent peril.</p>
