That upon the 15th day of June, A. D. 1863, Peter Herdic, William McCann, Eber Culver, Louis Schneider, and Philip A. Moltz, assembled together, and without authority of law, proceeded to elect as officers of the borough of Williamsport — Abraham Updegraff, Treasurer; John W. fieylmun, Street Regulator; Adam Follmer, John W.

Allen, present at said meeting at any timé. That as soon as the aforesaid election was held, Peter Herdic took the books containing the records of the borough, and carried them off, and that said records are now under his control. That he is informed and believes that the election so held as aforesaid, for the officers aforesaid, is totally illegal and void, and wras held without any warrant or authority whatsoever,” with a prayer for an injunction to restrain said persons from exercising the duties of the offices to which they were elected as above stated.

That upon the first Monday in June last, a majority of the members of the town council above named were not present, and consequently no business was or could be transacted by them at that time.

But it is alleged that the appointees had not entered upon, or exercised, or attempted to exercise, the duties of their offices when the bill was filed. If that be so, it only <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>shows that the plaintiff moved too soon. He should have waited, and if they never entered or usurped the exercise of authority under their appointments, no harm would have been done; but if they did, that moment the law would afford an ample remedy by <em>quo warranto </em>for trying their right. This specific remedy at law, ousts the equitable jurisdiction of the case. There should, therefore, have been judgment on the demurrer for the defendants, and the bill dismissed.</p>
