    <p id="b523-7" data-blocks='[["BL_523.8",523,[208,1224,1156,1081]]]'>1. One element of the offer is that the defendants were not trustees of Ann Albright when they executed and delivered the bond in suit; and that in executing it they acted under a mistake of their rights, supposing that because they were administrators of their father, John Gross, they were also trustees of Ann Albright. Now in reference to this it is to be observed that no fraud is alleged to have been perpetrated or attempted upon the defendants by Jacob Leber at the time of, or as inducement to the execution of the bond by them ; nor that they were ignorant of the fact that they had not then been appointed by the court trustees in the room of their deceased father ; but only that they supposed that because they were administrators of their father, they were also trustees of Ann Albright, and acted under a mistake of their rights. But a mistake of their rights in that regard is a mistake of law; and it is a well-established principle of equity that a mistake of the law shall not affect agreements, nor excuse from the legal consequences of particular acts. The whole subject of the jurisdiction of courts of equity, founded upon the ground of mistake, is fully considered and elaborately treated by Judge Story in his Equity Jurisprudence, ch. 5, <em>Mistake, </em>§ 110 to 176. The distinction between mistakes of law and those of fact has been fully recognised in Pennsylvania: Good <em>v. </em>Herr, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 253" data-case-ids="481841" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0253-01">7 W. &amp; S. 253</a>; Peters <em>v. </em>Florence, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20194" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Wright 194">2 Wright 194</a>; Rankin <em>v. </em>Mortimer, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20374" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="7 Watts 374">7 Watts 374</a>; McAninch <em>v. </em>Laughlin, 1 Harris 375; Light <em>v. </em>Light, 9 <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20374" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 Watts 374">Id. 407</a>.</p>

Another branch of the offer is, that Ann Albright was not present at the time, had no knowledge of the transaction, and gave no consent to it. Now whatever effect this fact might have <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>on any remedy of the defendants against Ann Albright or her estate, it is not perceived how it is to discharge the defendants from their obligation to the plaintiff, which they chose to enter into without consulting her. Their mistake in not obtaining her assent, was not induced by any act of the plaintiff, and was a mistake as to the extent of their authority to bind her; still a mistake of the law without an ingredient of misapprehension of facts.</p>
    <p id="b524-6" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[268,758,1153,387]]]'>3. It was also proposed to be shown, that there was nothing due from the three defendants, as individuals or on their individual account, to the estate of Ann Albright. But it is not perceived that that fact could give them any claim to relief from their bond to the plaintiff. It is not alleged that they were led to suppose that they were indebted to her, nor that they were under any misapprehension on that point; nor can we imagine how their indebtedness to her could have any bearing upon the validity of the bond in controversy.</p>
    <p id="b524-7" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[265,1145,1156,899]]]'>4. The remainder of the offer was to show that this whole question was investigated by the auditor appointed by the court to make distribution of the proceeds of Ann Albright’s estate, whose report was confirmed, as shown by the opinion of the court, August 16th 1862, which proceedings were made part of the offer, and are spread at large on plaintiff in error’s paper-book. But these proceedings have no relation to the question in dispute between these parties. Their object was to determine the distribution of the trust estate. They are <em>res inter alios acta; </em>and the defendants were actually examined as witnesses therein; and it would be strange if they could now set them up to bar the plaintiffs’ claim against themselves. If they could be used for any purpose at all, they would most effectually show how utterly destitute the defendants’ case is of a shadow of justice or equity to sustain their plea; for the object of the arrangement Avas to discharge McCormick, the surety of Ann Albright, on the bond given by her as guardian of her own son, Jacob Leber, the plaintiff. Having effectuated this object, to relieve the defendants of the responsibility which they then assumed for that purpose, and leave the plaintiff remediless, would, it is- submitted, be not equity but gross injustice.</p>

It does not show fraud, mistake of facts, nor failure of consideration. Throughout the whole of it, the defendants make no offer to prove what the consideration of the bond really was. In order to succeed in a defence setting up a claim for relief from the payment of his obligation, a defendant must clearly show — first, what the consideration was; and secondly, that it has failed in whole or in part. An entire absence of consideration, even if such were <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>alleged, would not avail the party in the absence of fraud or mistake of facts.

They are these: That Ann Albright, then Ann Leber, in 1844, executed a deed to John- Gross, for a tract of land in trust for herself, “ to manage and conduct (as we find by referring to the deed offered) said estate to the best advantage, for the benefit of said Ann Leber, and out of the yearly income of said property, pay taxes, repairs, and other necessary expenses, and the balance remaining to be paid over to her for her sole and separate use; and further, in trust, that if in case the said Ann Leber should marry and again become a widow, to re-convey the aforesaid described premises to her, if requested by her.”</p>

Gross, the trustee who succeeded John Gross, the deceased trustee, was not appointed until 1852, after delivery of the bond. That, at the time of giving the bond, the defendants were not trustees of Ann Albright, and she was not present, had no knowledge of the transaction, and gave no consent to it: that, when the defendants gave the bond, they were not themselves indebted to Ann Albright, <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>and that, in giving it, they acted under a mistake, in supposing they were trustees because they were administrators, when in fact they were not so. The deed which is a part of the offer contains no authority to the trustee, John Gross, to apply the avails of the trust to the payment of Ann Albright’s debts, and a part of the offer is, that she was not privy to the bond and gave no consent. Now, from the evidence offered, it plainly appears that the defendants gave their bond for a debt, which their intestate did not owe, and was not authorized to pay; and they wrere not trustees in law or in fact; and were not authorized to pay Ann Albright’s debt, and did not owe the debt themselves; and they aver that, in giving the bond, they did so in mistake of their rights.</p>

It is not a voluntary bond or a bond given for the benefit of another, intending it so to be; but one given in a double mistake of the duty to pay, and the authority to undertake as trustees. The mistake was not one of mere law, but of fact as well as law. It is precisely that kind of case referred to by Story in his Equity Jurisprudence, Vol. I., §§ 120, 130, which he says “ seems to involve in some measure a mistake of fact arising from a mistake of law,” and makes it an exception to the undeniable rule, that equity cannot relieve in cases of mere ignorance or mistake of law. That rule is the well-settled law of this state: Rankin <em>v. </em>Mortimere, <a href="/watts/7/0372-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="7 Watts 372" data-case-ids="1846901" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0372-01">7 Watts 372</a>; McAninch <em>v. </em>Laughlin, 1 Harris 371. But in the cases in which the doctrine prevails, that ignorance of the law will not avail as a defence; it has been where the party has acted upon misconception of some legal effect, which he supposed would follow, or some legal right which he supposed he had or had not. In each case he intended to act in his own personal and individual capacity, and the mistake was only collateral to the direct act. But here the parties acted in the capacity of trustees, for so the bond expressly states, and they bind themselves as such, and it is declared on as a bond of trustees. No duty lay on John Gross to pay Ann Albright’s debt, and none lay upon them as his administrators. They were not trustees in fact, and were not in law. They wholly misconceived thé attitude in which they were placed, and the character which they bore. It was a mistake of the facts of their position, arising, it is true, out of misconception of their legal relation. It resembles much in principle Heacock <em>v. </em>Ely, 2 Harris 540. There a conveyance was made for the use of a married woman, who executed alone the bond and mortgage for the purchase-money. The bond and mortgage being void, it was held, that equity would rescind the conveyance held in trust <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>for her. It is very clear, that the conveyance was founded in a mistake of the law, as to the power of a married woman to bind herself by bond and mortgage, yet it led to a mistake of her capacity as of a <em>feme sole, </em>and caused a conveyance to be made, which otherwise would not have been. So, here, the defendants bound themselves as trustees. They intended to bind the trust and not themselves : they mistook their capacity.</p>
