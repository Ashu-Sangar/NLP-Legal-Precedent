This raises the only question not disposed of in this case. On the argument no adjudicated case was produced which fully meets this question, and it may therefore be regarded as a new one. The County of Lycoming <em>v. </em>J. H. Huling, cited by plaintiffs’ counsel, involved a question analogous to this, but somewhat different. In that case, Huling had been treasurer of Lycoming county, and on settlement of his account with the county, a balance was found due from him to the county. He paid a portion of it to his successor, and suit was brought on his official bond to recover what remained unpaid. His defence was, that this was made up of road-taxes assessed and paid on unseated lands. The court below held this to be a good defence, and the Supreme Court held that it was not. I regard as applicable to this case now under consideration the reasoning of the Supreme Court in their opinion reversing the judgment in the case of Lycoming County <em>v. </em>Huling. I read from a manuscript copy of that opinion:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b163-21" data-blocks='[["BL_163.16",163,[159,2056,1167,388]],["BL_164.1",164,[258,421,1167,990]]]'>“ ‘ The unseated lands of the Commonwealth, like all other property in the respective townships, must bear their due proportion of the expense of opening and repairing the public roads. But the taxes for that purpose can only be assessed upon the lands, and are not a personal charge upon the owners. The payment of them can be enforced in no other way than by a proceeding against the lands. Though the supervisors are charged with the duty of expending the money, they have no power to collect it. It is payable by the owners into the county treasury, and if not <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>paid voluntarily, it is the duty of the county officers to sell the lands — in the same manner as for county and state taxes. While it is in the treasury it is, to all intents and purposes, a county fund, differing from other county funds only in this — that it must be applied to a special object. If it should be lost by the failure of the treasurer and his sureties, or by any other cause, the county would be liable for it to the township. The treasurer had the custody of it in his official character as treasurer. He had no right 'to put it into his private pocket, and settle with the supervisors on his individual responsibility. It is paid out in orders by the 'commissioners. The orders are presentable and payable at the treasury, and not at the private counter of an ex-treasurer. The money to meet them must therefore remain in the treasury; and it was the clear, plain duty of the treasurer when he went out of office, not to carry this money away with him, but to pay it over to his successor. This is made his duty not only by the nature of his office and the character of the fund, but by the literal words of his bond, whichsays that he shall account for all moneys which may come into his hands in pursuance of said office, and pay all that belongs to the county. To say that it cannot be recovered on the bond to the county, is saying that it need not be paid at all, for the township have no bond for it, nor anything else on which they can sustain a suit.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.4",164,[261,1411,1166,1031]]]'>
      <em>“ </em>I regard these cases as analogous, so far as the application of legal principles and rules is concerned. Huling was held liable on the ground that the township taxes, which he had received, and which were charged in his account with the county, were paid to him in his official capacity as treasurer; and when thus paid, constituted county funds then in the custody of the county treasury, for the safe-keeping and payment of which to the townships the county was liable. The liability of the county to the townships is the basis of the right to recovery by the county against Huling on his official bond; and if this right is well founded, there can bo no doubt of the right of the plaintiffs to recover in this case. The fact that these taxes were not included as a charge against Rees in his general account with the county of Potter, is no answer to this argument. If they were county funds when paid, and were in the county treasury, it was the duty of the county auditors to charge them in Rees’s account with the county, and their omission to do so does not discharge the liability of the county. If it does, then the townships have no security for the payment of their taxes on unseated lands. They have no mode of compelling payment, except through the action of the county commissioners or treasurer, and when paid to the treasurer they are remediless in case of his insolvency, as they have no bond from him with sureties to which they can resort.</p>

But this remedy gives no additional security or guaranty of payment in the case of an insolvent treasurer, and the act does not release, either expressly or by implication, any right which the townships had, prior to its passage, to compel payment by the county.</p>
