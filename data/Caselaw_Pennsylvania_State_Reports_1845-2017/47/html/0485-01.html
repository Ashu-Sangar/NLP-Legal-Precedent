B. Grubb, as per contract, were too remote to be recognised by the law, and could not be brought into this inquiry, because unliquidated, personal to C. B. Grubb, and foreign to the issue, which was the balance due on the three judgments held by plaintiffs.” This the court answered as follows:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b486-10" data-blocks='[["BL_486.8",486,[369,1719,1158,729]],["BL_487.1",487,[153,407,1165,857]]]'>“I shall consider the two propositions or points presented by the counsel for the defendants together. Whether the plaintiffs are entitled to recover the 2-| per cent., mentioned in the first point, will depend upon the circumstances of the case as supported by the testimony. If at the time the plaintiffs agreed to assume the payment of the three judgments given in evidence, and as an inducement for the plaintiffs thus assuming that responsibility, and in order to enable them to meet the payment of the acceptances or notes, which they were about executing in favour of the trustees of Mrs. Parker and Mrs. Ogilvie, when they arrived at maturity, it was agreed by the defendants to furnish the plaintiffs Avith iron, with the proceeds of which to meet the payment of these acceptances or notes as they became due, and the defendants, instead of meeting their engagements, made default, whereby the plaintiffs were compelled to make sale of their own property, and were thereby subjected to trouble, expense, and loss, then the plaintiffs are entitled to a reasonable <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>remuneration for such trouble, expense, and loss; but if the amount claimed is used merely as a cloak for the purpose of recovering usurious interest, you will reject it. How this is, will be for you to say under the evidence, and in making such allowance you are to put nothing in the plaintiffs’ pocket, for being forced into market with their property, but what was actually the expense, trouble, and injury they sustained in consequence of the defendants not meeting their engagements, for this is to be reimbursed, together with the interest on what is their just claim, but for nothing more. Whether the 2J per cent, mentioned would more than accomplish that object, is, under the evidence, for you to say. I think the contract on which the remuneration is claimed is not too remote to be recognised by the law. If no expense, trouble, or injury was sustained by the plaintiffs in consequence of the stipulations entered into by the parties, no more than legal interest, 6 per cent., can be recovered. When a contract is made to compensate another for the use of his name to obtain credits, such contract would be good; but does the word commission mean that here, and is the claim made for that <em>? </em>I think the evidence does not show that it does.” .</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b487-6" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[153,1272,1166,561]]]'>In their general charge the court <em>said: </em>— “ The great bone of contention is the commission charged for advances. If this meant an enlargement of interest beyond 6 per cent, per annum, such charges would most undoubtedly be usurious and cannot be recovered. The law will not allow such recovery, and no acquiescence, on the part of the defendant, as to the correctness of such charge, will prevent him from taking advantage of the matter now. But it is said this was a charge made in consequence of the defendants’ failing to comply with their agreement in furnishing iron as stipulated by the parties, and that in consequence of such default the plaintiffs were subject to injury, loss, &amp;c.. With regard to this I gave my views in answer to the defendants’ points.”</p>

There were no pleadings in the case, but this was no reason for going into the question of unliquidated damages for breaches of contract between the parties. The issue was not broad enough for that. The question was simply one of liquidation, and not one admitting of a general defence. This is enough, we think, to say, in relation to the claim for. unliquidated damages set up by the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b488-5" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[314,797,1157,932]]]'>Evidently, no such thing was contemplated when the issue was ordered. Accounts current had been furnished to the defendants by the plaintiffs, regularly embracing their entire claim <em>; </em>but in none of them is there any charge or claim for damages. In lieu of this, there are charges of two-and-a-half per cent, commissions for advances for six months, and this is based upon an alleged failure on part of the defendants to furnish iron to be sold on commission, to meet the notes given by the plaintiffs as collateral to the judgments. The defendants object to this as usurious, and we think it is: Large <em>v. </em>Passmore, 5 S. &amp; R. 51. The judgments which the plaintiffs received by assignment, and which they undertook to pay and did pay, bore interest, and this was all. the interest they could recover. They had commissions on sales of iron and guaranties ; this was a proper charge in the accounts current, but the two-and-a-half per cent, for advances was not. It is true there was evidence of a promise to allow these commissions, but as they are usurious the agreement cannot be enforced. If the defendants chose to fly from their promise in this respect, the law permits them to do so. It is a matter entirely within the cognisance of their own consciences. The judgment must be reversed for the reasons suggested above, and the case sent back for a new trial.</p>
