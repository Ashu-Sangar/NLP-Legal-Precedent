Coxe, the party named in the claim as owner and the defendant here, is the owner of a lot, through or across which a street or avenue, called Pennsylvania avenue, has been laid out on a plan of the district, which has been confirmed. But the street has never been opened, except as hereinafter specified, nor have any steps been taken for this purpose. The proposed avenue is one hundred feet wide, crosses the lot diagonally, and covers about one-half of it.</p>

The width of this road is twenty-five feet, and is in the centre of the ground laid out for the said avenue, on the plan of the city or district. The avenue is not indicated on the ground by metes and bounds.</p>

The culvert is some feet distant from the north line of the railroad, and some feet distant from the northern line of the proposed avenue.</p>

The court shall have the power to make such inferences from the foregoing facts which a jury could do, or ought to do if the same were proven to them upon issuable pleadings under a writ of <em>scire facias. </em>It is admitted the claims were duly filed. If the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, then a judgment to be entered therefor, and the damages to be assessed in conformity with the claims and interest thereon, as hereinbefore stated; if otherwise, judgment to be entered for the defendant. Either party to take out writs or writ of error, and to withdraw the case stated, if, in the opinion of the court, some further facts should be admitted or proven for the final adjudication of the matters herein submitted.”</p>

Until opened, it is clearly not a street (for if it is, it is one hundred feet wide), but a piece of land marked out for a street, nearly twenty years ago, and under existing laws it cannot become one until damages are assessed and paid, or secured to be paid, according to law: Sower <em>v. </em>City of Philadelphia, 11 Casey 231; District of City of Pittsburgh, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0320-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 320" data-case-ids="1853576" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0320-01">2 W.&amp;S. 320</a>.</p>

In cases like the present, it is within the power of the legislature to oblige the owners of property, similarly situated to the plaintiff, to pay their share of such expenses. In the present instance, this sewer was of vast importance to the citizens at large, and its object was to prevent the drainage of a large district passing into the Schuylkill above the dam, and thus preserving the purity of the water, upon which so much of the health of our city depends.</p>
