The recording acts are worth nothing, as also is every other species of notice, if' this be not so. The doctrine may be found upon this point in 3 S. &amp; R. 423; <a href="/watts-serg/5/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 49" data-case-ids="478660" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0049-01">5 W. &amp; S. 49</a>; <a href="/watts/10/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Watts 13" data-case-ids="1851011" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0013-01">10 Watts 13</a>, 407; <a href="/watts-serg/4/0307-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 307" data-case-ids="1856425" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0307-01">4 W. &amp; S. 307</a> ; Story’s Equity, § 410. After conveyance for a valuable consideration, accepted and recorded, without notice of title or claim in another, derived through recorded conveyances, that cut off any previous equity or title derived from the original owners, the vendee is not to be subjected to have a piece of his tract taken from him, to be measured by the extent of unpaid purchase-money. The recording acts relieve against such a result, even when the claimant has the prior deed, by rendering it void as against the subsequent deed for a valuable consideration, first recorded, without actual notice. There was therefore'no necessity for balancing the equities between the plaintiff’s alleged original equity, and the residue of the purchase-money. It was not a case for- the application of that rule. On <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>these principles, we hold that the plaintiff was not and will not be entitled to recover, unless upon some different and better grounds than presented.</p>

The circumstance that he bought the land, paid for it, and directed the deed to be made to his son, raised no resulting trust in his favour. The law regards such a transaction as an executed gift; Knouff <em>v. </em>Thompson, 4 Haines 357; but under the view we have taken, his testimony was not of any great consequence, excepting as it raised the question here discussed.</p>
