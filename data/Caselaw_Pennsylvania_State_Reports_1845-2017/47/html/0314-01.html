It was simply to construct their railroad “ in such direction as they shall deem best to connect with the termination of the City Railroad.” The authority is not expressly to connect with the City Railroad, but merely to the end that they might do so. Clearly, the utmost that can be asked for these words is a <em>permission </em>to connect. That it was nothing more than a mere license is evident, not only from the language thus used, but from the’ attending circumstances. The City Railroad then had no existence in fact or in contract. It was not until the 28th of April 1831,. twenty-six days after the passage of the charter in question, that the city gave the pledge <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>to make the City Railroad, in order to have the State Railroad continued from the Schuylkill to Broad and Vine streets, nor until the 10th of January 1838, that the ordinance was passed to construct it.</p>

It is clear, therefore, that at the time of the charter of the Southwark Railroad Company the state had no power whatever to compel a connection between the two roads. There was nothing then in being to which a vested right could attach, nothing but a mere expectancy, and a legislative license to seek the connection when the city built her road, and permitted the connection. If any authority were necessary, we have a decision directly on the point in the case of The North Branch Passenger Railway Company <em>v. </em>The City Railway Company, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20361" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="2 Wright 361">2 Wright 361</a>.</p>

Clearly, such a license is revocable, but admitting that it might endure while the City Railroad should last, where is the contract or guaranty on the part of the city that she should keep up her road for ever, or so long at the least as the Southwark Company should require the use of the connection ? Suppose the Southwark Company should choose to abandon its road at this point, and pass directly from the Delaware to the Schuylkill, is there any contract in <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>favour of the city which she could enforce to prevent the abandonment?
