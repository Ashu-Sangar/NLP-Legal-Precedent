Robertson &amp; Co. to draw for them a certain quantity of bark from the woods to their tannery, at a certain price per cord. On the 25th of February 1861, Batten called at the store of Robertson &amp; Co. to settle, and represented to them that he had drawn all of the bark. On this assurance they settled, and found a balance of $47.31 due him. Batten then requested them to place this amount to the credit of Amos Reed, to whom he was indebted, which Mr. Robertson assented to and did, giving Batten the following paper:—</p>

In a day or two it was ascertained that a portion of the bark had not been drawn, but had been burned in the woods by Batten or his hands. On the 1st of March Amos Reed came to Robertson &amp; Co.’s store — not having seen Batten since his arrangement of the credit — when he was informed what had been done, but that owing to the burning of the bark they did not owe Batten anything, and would, therefore, not pay any money to Reed. Reed then settled with them his account of about $11, and gave them a receipt in full.</p>

He was an entire stranger to both the promise and the consideration ; and, as the promise to pay was not in the shape of mercantile paper, these considerations, according to the cases cited, would seem to be decisive as to his right to sue in his own name. But if this were the only objection, it would be hardly worth while to reverse, as the defect would undoubtedly be amendable, under the Act of Assembly authorizing a change or alteration in the names of parties ; we should in such case treat it as amended, or permit the amendment here: but we think there are other grounds .of just complaint on the record.</p>
    <p id="b117-6" data-blocks='[["BL_117.4",117,[110,1004,1166,431]]]'>The defendants, after entering a credit upon Reed’s account, of the sum claimed to be due by Batten for completing his contract with Robertson &amp; Co., in hauling bark, discovered, or supposed they did, that instead of hauling the bark, it had been burned by Batten or his men, and with his knowledge, at least, if not personally active in it. To claim for hauling what he knew (if he was not a participant in it), was destroyed, and to procure an allowance, was a gross fraud on Robertson &amp; Co. To the offer to prove this the plaintiff objected, and the court overruled the testimony.</p>
    <p id="b117-7" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[103,1436,1169,642]]]'>We cannot see on what grounds this was done. Had it been an acceptance in favour of Reed, which it was not, as he parted with nothing for it, the fraud would have been a defence when he came to enforce it. It was but a certificate that Batten had left $47.31 to place to the credit of Reed. There was nothing in the form of the instrument to prevent an attack upon it for fraud or mistake, and the plaintiff parted with nothing as a consideration, so far as we can discover. Indeed, it seems, he never even had possession of the certificate. Under these circumstances the defendants were entitled to withdraw the credit, before the plaintiff was involved in a loss by their doing so. This they did and so informed the plaintiff, who does not seem to have made any objection, but settled his account, on which the sum in question was to have been a credit, and received the balance without objection.</p>
