While the public works belonged to the Commonwealth they were not subject to taxation. Whether the stock of the West Branch and Susquehanna division is subject to a <em>state tax </em>upon their capital stock is put to rest by the Act of May 1st 1861, Pamph. Laws 1468. The preamble declares that doubts had arisen under then existing laws, whether the companies and associations which have purchased and then owned the different lines of the canals, theretofore sold to the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, were subject to a state tax on their capital stock, and to remove those doubts it is declared and enacted, among others named in the act, that the West Branch and Susquehanna Division Canal Company, are each and all of them declared to be thereafteer subject to the payment to the Commonwealth of the same taxes, upon their capital stock respectively, as are assessed upon the capital stock of companies incorporated by or under any laws of the Commonwealth, in pursuance of the act entitled ‘An act to equalize taxation upon corporations,’ approved the 12th day of April 1859.</p>

If doubts existed as to the right to impose a tax upon the stock of the company for state purposes, it existed with equal force on the 1st of May 1861. The expression in the act ‘for all state and county purposes whatsoever,’ appears as clear in the one case as the other,-but the 33d section renders the right to tax for county purposes less clear. The legislature, by the Act of 1861, subjects the stock in that company, after its passage, to a tax for state purposes. The power of the legislature to exempt stock of this company from taxation for one purpose and impose it for another will not be questioned. There is no declaration in the Act of 1861, or expression by the legislature, that the stock was liable to taxation for any other purpose before that time, but only thereafter. The Act of 1861 subjects the stock to taxation for state purposes only, and the exercise of the legislative power for that purpose only is satisfied or no other or additional tax will be imposed by courts: New York and Erie Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Sabin, 2 Casey 245. Taxation is a legislative, not judicial power. The same remarks made by Justice Woodward in the case just cited may be made in the case under consideration. If the legislature had meant that the property of this company should be taxable, in the ordinary modes, under our Acts of Assembly of the 15th of April 1834, and the 29th of April 1844, they would have imposed no special taxation, or if they meant that the company should be taxable under these acts, in addition to the special imposition, they would have said so. Without some word to lead us to that conclusion, we will not infer that both special and general legislation were intended.”</p>

Shares of stock, and capital stock, of a corporation are distinct and different things obviously, and we think the distinction is plain in the act.</p>

This is a corporation tax differently imposed and collected, and for state purposes only.

That act added some new subjects of taxation, for state and county purposes, in its first section, and in the 3d provided a mode for the discovery of the amount of money due and owing to the taxable inhabitants, firms, partnerships, and corporations, whether by judgment, decree, mortgage, bond, note, &amp;c., and also the amount of all <em>shares of stock </em>held or owned by such person or persons, firms, &amp;c., “ in any bank, institution, or company, now or hereafter incorporated in pursuance of any law of any other state or government.” The omission of the words in this sentence <em>ulaw of this Commonwealth or," </em>which is in precisely the same language in the 32d section of the Act of 1844, with the exception of the omitted words, is supposed to be an implied repeal of the express provision making shares of stock in state institutions and corporations taxable for county purposes. The objects of these provisions are dissimilar. The first was to declare what property and subjects should be taxed for state and county, purposes; the second was, designed to facilitate the assessment and collection of the taxes on these enumerated subjects, and the omission merely to require answers in regard to any one of them, would not on any principle of law stand for an exoneration. It would be taxable, notwithstanding there might be greater difficulties in the way of discovering the amount <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>and value. My individual opinion is, that the omission noticed was accidental, and has not in practice been regarded.
