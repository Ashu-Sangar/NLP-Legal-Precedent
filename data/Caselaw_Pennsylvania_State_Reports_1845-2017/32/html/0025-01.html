Not being able to make an arrangement with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company on such terms as would justify the expenditure of so large an amount as would be necessary to construct the road, and the amount of stock subscribed not being sufficient to warrant the commencement of the work, with the expectation of being able to complete it, the directors called a meeting of the stockholders, at which a proposition, to abandon the project of constructing a road east from Pittsburgh, and to turn their attention west, for the purpose of making a road in that direction, was submitted by the president, and if not carried by a majority of the stockholders present, was decided to be, and so announced, by the chairman. The meeting was a stormy one, and seems to have broken up in some confusion. The resolution, which is alleged to have been passed by the stockholders, at that meeting, was laid before the board of directors, and in order to carry it out, the directors ordered an account of the expenditures to be taken, and the unexpended moneys in the treasury to be refunded, <em>pro rata, </em>to the stockholders who were willing to receive the same. It would seem, that there was a considerable number of the stockholders — among whom General Larimer was prominent — who were unwilling to abandon the project of constructing the road east. At the time fixed for the annual meeting of the company, in December 1847, these stockholders met and elected a new board <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>of directors, of which General Larimer was president. The old board, elected in December 1846, of which General Robinson was president, were unwilling to recognise the new board, and for a time there was a struggle between them, both claiming the right to control and direct the affairs of the company. This controversy terminated on the 14th of February 1848, by the members of the old board resigning, one at a time, and electing the members of the new board in their place. The new board, however, proceeded to carry out the resolution of the old board, ordering the unexpended moneys to be refunded, <em>piro </em>rata, to the stockholders, and paid to such as applied therefor their proportion of said moneys, taking from them an assignment of their stock for the use of the company. In this way, 5794 shares of the stock were transferred to. General Larimer, as appears by a resolution of the directors, of the 3d of December 1853, authorizing him to transfer the same to the company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b28-6" data-blocks='[["BL_28.6",28,[292,1093,1159,458]]]'>“ General Larimer and his associates seem to have cherished the hope of being able, at some future day, to renew the project of constructing the road, and for this purpose they had some work done, in 1848, to save the charter, took an assignment of the stock above mentioned, and kept up the organization of the company. The defendant did not apply for his <em>pro rata </em>share of the unexpended moneys, or transfer the stock subscribed in his name. Does he then remain liable therefor, supposing him to have authorized or sanctioned the subscription; or was he discharged by the proceedings of the stockholders and directors of the company to which I have referred ?</p>

He was not bound to demand or receive his proportion of the unexpended moneys — he might let them remain in the treasury, without incurring thereby any obligation to the company. The evidence, if believed, shows that the project of constructing a road east, so as to connect with the Baltimore and Ohio road, was abandoned, <em>not only for the time being, but altogether, so far as the then stockholders were concerned. </em>Because, although some of them were not willing to give up all hopes of being able ultimately to accomplish the enterprise, they nevertheless acquiesced in its abandonment by the then stockholders, and aided in carrying their determination into effect by paying to the stockholders, who applied therefor, the money ordered to be refunded. It was competent,' as I think, for the stockholders and directors of the company to agree to abandon the project of constructing the road, and to surrender their stock and divide the unexpended moneys rateably between them, x'knd if they did so agree, and if, in pursuance <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>thereof, a large number of the stockholders transferred or surrendered their stock, and received their proportion of the unexpended moneys, it would operate as a release and discharge of all stockholders from their liability as subscribers. After thus abandoning the enterprise, and releasing so large a number of the stockholders, it would be against equity to hold a stockholder, who had not received his <em>pro rata </em>share, liable for the full amount of his stock. And I therefore instruct the jury, that if they find the facts to be substantially as I have stated them, the defendant was discharged from all liability for the stock in question. But though these proceedings, on the part of the stockholders and of the directors, were sufficient to discharge the defendant, yet he was not thereby <em>absolutely compelled </em>to give up his stock, and surrender his rights as a stockholder. He might retain his stock, and unite with other stockholders in keeping up the organization of the company, and do such acts, in the prosecution of their common enterprise, as would estop him from denying his liability as a subscriber. Has the defendant then done any such act as will estop him from setting up the defence arising from the action of the stockholders and directors, and which, as we have seen, was sufficient to have discharged him from all liability for the alleged subscription ? It seems, that a meeting of the stockholders was held on the 8th of June 1858, to determine whether the company would accept the amendments which had been made to their charter by the legislature of that year, and also whether they would accept the subscription made by the county to the stock of the company. The defendant gave his proxy to William Larimer, Jr., to represent him at that meeting, and authorized him to vote the stock to which he was entitled. If the defendant had attended that meeting in person, and had voted the fifty shares of stock in question, or if, by his proxy to Larimer, he had expressly authorized him to vote fifty shares, it is conceded that he would be estopped from denying his liability for that number. But it is contended that, because the proxy does not specify any particular number of shares, the defendant is not estopped from denying his liability for the instalments claimed in this action. This raises the question as to the legal effect of the proxy given to Larimer. What, then, was the effect of that proxy, and how far is the defendant responsible for the use which Larimer made of it? By giving the proxy, the defendant admitted that he was the owner of stock in the company, which he was entitled to vote. If it were shown that he authorized General Larimer to vote only a certain number of shares, he would not be estopped from denying his liability for a greater number. But nothing of this kind has been shown. What authority, then, did he give to Larimer by the proxy? How many shares did he authorize him to vote? Because if Larimer exceeded the authority given to him, the defendant is not bound by his act. <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>It seems' to me that, by the proxy, he authorized Larimer to vote the number of shares standing in his name on the books of the company. The true construction and legal effect of the proxy, as I think, is the same as if, in express terms, it had authorized Larimer to vote the stock standing in defendant’s name on the company’s books. The tally lists, in evidence, show that Larimer, as defendant’s proxy, voted fifty shares on the acceptance of the amendments to the charter — and the same number of shares on the acceptance of the subscription made by the county to the stock of the company. If the books of the company show that the defendant was entitled to fifty shares of stock, he is as much estopped from denying his liability therefor, as if he had been present and had voted in person that number of shares.”</p>

He has a right to insist that the company shall perform its charter duties in the time and manner prescribed, and that other subscriptions shall be enforced in the same manner as his own. And, when the company let off part of its subscribers and returned them their money, without the consent of the defendant, actual or implied, they discharged him from all liability growing out of his original subscription.

In the case of the Lumbermen’s Bank, the suit was on a promissory note which recognised the existence of the corporation. Here, it was on a promise which entered into the formation of the company — a preliminary contract, which, made upon the conditions expressed in the incorporating act, could be enforced only after substantial performance of those conditions. Eor the purpose of testing the defendant’s liability, therefore— not for the purpose of declaring the charter forfeited — it was competent to show what the company were required by law to do, and what in point of fact they had done. This was the extent to which the proposed defence went; and we do not think it was .excluded by what was ruled in the cited case.

    <p id="b33-4" data-blocks='[["BL_33.6",33,[216,505,1156,128]]]'>A special meeting AYas held on the 8th June 1853, at which Larimer voted on fifty shares of James McCully, for accepting the Allegheny county subscription, and the Act of Assembly.</p>
    <p id="b33-5" data-blocks='[["BL_33.7",33,[218,634,1152,129]]]'>This was the evidence from which the jury was instructed to infer McCully’s consent to be bound by his subscription of 1846, notwithstanding all that had occurred to release him.</p>
    <p id="b33-6" data-blocks='[["BL_33.8",33,[216,763,1155,216]]]'>We think it was incompetent for such a purpose. The letter of attorney was manifestly an incomplete instrument. There was no evidence that the insertion of Larimer’s name was with the knowledge or consent of McCully, or that he was aware that Larimer AYas acting for him.</p>
    <p id="b33-7" data-blocks='[["BL_33.9",33,[209,980,1162,640]]]'>But at most, it was only an authority to accept legislation that looked exclusively to new subscriptions, and not to the validating of old ones. The Act of 1853 did not cure the consequences of past delay and of the doings of 1847, nor did it affect to bind any subscriber already on the books. It touched none of these subjects. It seems rather to have been designed to enable General Larimer to start the road on <em>municipal </em>subscriptions, thereafter to be obtained. And the defendant, supposing him to have given a valid and formal proxy, was willing, doubtless, that General Larimer should resuscitate the company in this manner. Standing on the books as a stockholder, it was a formal assent on the part of the defendant to the new policy; but did he mean to re-subscribe himself? Is it a fair interpretation of his act that he acknowledged his subscription of 1846 as a subsisting, legal obligation ?</p>
    <p id="b33-8" data-blocks='[["BL_33.10",33,[209,1620,1157,129]]]'>We think not. We think it would be giving extravagant effect to an equivocal and insignificant act to allow it to stand for virtually a new subscription.</p>
    <p id="b33-9" data-blocks='[["BL_33.11",33,[204,1750,1160,685]],["BL_34.1",34,[345,425,1156,86]]]'>The defendant’s original subscription, made by another hand than his OAvn, rested, as we have seen, on an implication from a former letter of attorney to Kelly. After so much delay — more than was necessary for the statute of limitations to attach — and after such decisive acts of abandonment on the part of the company, amounting almost to dissolution, something more should have been proved to hold the defendant, than the unfinished letter of attorney to Larimer. So vague and indefinite an acknoAvledgment of original indebtedness, would be insufficient to take any case out of the statute of limitations. True, the statute is not pleaded here; but, vre have to deal with presumptions that are almost equal as a defence, and the evidence to repel them ought to be like, in nature, if not in extent, to that which alone is competent to avert the statutory bar. How much stock did the defendant acknowledge himself to be responsible for ? The letter of attorney gives no answer, and no evidence in the case answers <a id="p34" href="#p34" data-label="34" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*34</a>the question. The learned judge said the number of shares on the books, but it was merely a judicial conjecture.</p>
    <p id="b34-4" data-blocks='[["BL_34.5",34,[344,510,1154,217]]]'>The truth is, undue importance was given to this evidence by the court. It was not merely submitted to the jury for them to infer consent from, but it was put to them as sufficient to estop the defendant from denying his liability for the whole number of shares originally subscribed for.</p>
    <p id="b34-5" data-blocks='[["BL_34.6",34,[342,724,1147,122]]]'>It ought to have been rejected altogether; or, being admitted, should have been controlled so as not to deprive the defendant of the benefit of the facts on which he relied.</p>
    <p id="b34-6" data-blocks='[["BL_34.7",34,[335,853,1156,556]]]'>It may be said, that it was evidence of the same nature as that on which the jury were permitted to presume the original subscription ; — that if the letter of attorney to Kelly was sufficient to ground a presumption of subscription, that to Larimer was competent to ground a presumption of renewal. Not so. The two instruments were different in character and circumstances. That to Kelly was complete, and could be accounted for on no other ground than that the subscription standing on the books, to the credit of the defendant, was his subscription; whilst that to Larimer was a defective instrument, and could be referred to another motive on the part of the defendant, than an intention to revive his subscription, to wit, a desire to obtain the municipal subscriptions.</p>
    <p id="b34-7" data-blocks='[["BL_34.8",34,[332,1408,1151,218]]]'>It may often be more difficult to prove an acknowledgment of an outlawed debt, than to prove the execution of the instrument of indebtedness.
