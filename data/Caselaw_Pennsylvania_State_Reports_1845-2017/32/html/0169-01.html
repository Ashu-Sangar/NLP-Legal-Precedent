It was a mode indeed of pushing the public improvements up to every man’s door, who was situated within three miles of any of the great lines. Each man was to do the work for himself under the jealous eye of the court, and subject to damages for injuries, but on a plan of his own. If a jury were to plan the ■work it would never be done.

It is not to be doubted, that in every instance where private property has been taken for the purposes of a lateral railroad, under this law, the Commonwealth might have taken it and constructed a railroad over it to connect her canals with mines, quarries, mills, and the like. When she granted her lands and permitted them to become private property, she threw in six acres <em>gratis </em>for every hundred she was paid for, that roads might be built as the future wants of the citizens should require.</p>
