The assignment of error is in these words: “ The court below erred in refusing to permit Newbold H. Trotter, witness called upon the part of the plaintiff in error, to prove that the water-works in the district of West Philadelphia were not finished, and no water introduced in the said district until August 1855, twenty months after the filing of the lien for water-pipe by the defendant in error; and also that the water was introduced into said district by the city of Philadelphia, after the corporation of the district of West Philadelphia'had been merged in the consolidated city of Philadelphia.”</p>
