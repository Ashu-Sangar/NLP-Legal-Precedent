Satisfied as the commissioners were of the invalidity of their deed, it was their duty to treat it as a nullity — to continue the assessment of the land in their tax books, and to compel payment of the public dues on it by another sale. At that sale, Chauncey Broekway became a purchaser; although one of the commissioners, he had a right to purchase, and is not estopped now from denying the validity of the prior sale, because, in his official capacity, he had assented to it.</p>

Little, the commissioners’ clerk, says, “ They were not treated by the commissioners as regularly sold to them — the whole, or nearly all of them, remained on the land book with the taxes charged to them — the commissioners directed that they should remain on the land books.” This witness says, there had been an adjournment of the sales to the 3d or 5th of January, but that no sale was cried on that day.
