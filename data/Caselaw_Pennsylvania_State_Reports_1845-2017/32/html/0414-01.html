The public, while entitled without distinction to travel upon railroads, are entitled to do so only in a particular manner, in vehicles controlled and managed by the company; and of the control and management of which, it would seem, the company are not allowed to divest themselves, even for the purpose of giving them up to another company: <em>Angell’s Law of Highways, </em>§ 370; and Beman <em>v. </em>Rufford, 6 <em>Eng.

If every man were permitted to occupy and use the tracks of railroads according to his own fancy or interests, or to dictate how cars should be loaded and arranged in the train, confusion and disaster, involving loss of life and injury to person and property, would ensue as inevitable consequences. The agents in charge at shipping points are presumed to know, better than freighters and drovers, how many dumb beasts ought to be put into a car, and what arrangements are- necessary to be made for their comfort and safety; and it is due, alike to the animals and the owners, that the skill and experience of the agents should dictate everything that pertains to the taking on, the carrying, and the discharge of the load: Ritz <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Railroad Company, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Leg.%20Int.%2075" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="15 Leg.

The plaintiff applied <em>to </em>the company’s shipping agent at Pittsburgh, for the transportation of a young and valuable mare to Philadelphia. Two witnesses swear that the plaintiff asked for tan for bedding for the mare, and that the agent told him he could not get tan, but said he could get plenty of straw, and directed him where straw was kept for sale. The straw was obtained and put into the car, in the presence, and without objection from the agent. On the way, it took fire by sparks from the engine, and burned the mare, if not to death, so badly as greatly to impair her value.</p>

The plaintiff’s point was dependent on the contingency that the fire originated from that cause — the use of the straw — and as the court refused to submit this question, we must presume it would have been found, as the plaintiff assumes the fact to be.</p>

And yet their agent stood by and suffered straw to be used without disclosing the danger, or pleading the rule, and thereby subjected the mare to the dreadful tortures described in the evidence, and the plaintiff to the loss of which he complains.</p>
    <p id="b418-11" data-blocks='[["BL_418.11",418,[326,1548,1153,856]]]'>Such is this case upon the record. It was a ease of flagrant negligence. For what is the company’s agent there, but to prescribe the bedding for animals shipped on board of their cars, as well as to superintend all the preparations for the trip ? The cars are theirs — under their exclusive control, and they are bound to see that they are road-worthy in all respects. A defective wheel, or axle, or framework, would confessedly render them liable even as against the release. The carrying of a combustible article so near the engine as to be exposed to sparks, was even more inexcusable ; for this could not escape observation, as defects in the vehicle might. To attend to nine things and neglect the tenth, was to be guilty of the whole law. They were to take every precaution which prudence, diligence, and experience could reasonably suggest. It was for this, the law gave them their charter and their right to be public transporters. Their business will become a snare for the unwary, and an intolerable nuisance in the community, if they be not held to the conditions they have assumed— if they may perform part of their duties, and turn over the rest to be performed by ignorance and inexperience, disasters will become almost as frequent as trips.</p>
