    <p id="b193-6" data-blocks='[["BL_193.7",193,[201,633,1156,75]]]'>The demurrer admits whatever facts are well pleaded and relevant.</p>
    <p id="b193-7" data-blocks='[["BL_193.8",193,[195,718,1160,301]]]'>It is argued that, although the Act of Assembly authorizes three commissioners to act, they can only act with legal effect when the others neglect or refuse to act, and that as the whole board, or at least a majority of them, were engaged in taking subscriptions, it was not competent for three to separate themselves from their colleagues, and make an <em>ex parte </em>certificate to the. governor.</p>
    <p id="b193-8" data-blocks='[["BL_193.9",193,[196,1019,1159,171]]]'>If this be accepted as a sound construction of the Act of Assembly, the question still recurs whether the three have not given a sufficient reason for separating from their colleagues, and acting by themselves.</p>
    <p id="b193-9" data-blocks='[["BL_193.10",193,[193,1190,1161,642]]]'>The legislature authorized the incorporation of this bank for honest and fair purposes, and it appointed the commissioners to carry the law into effect, in the ordinary manner in which other banking institutions are organized. They were to give all men an equal chance to subscribe stock. When, therefore, the five entered into a written engagement to J. It. Robinson to obtain for him the control of a majority of the capital stock, or to return him all the money he may pay on subscriptions, they made distinctions in his favour which were partial, unfair, and a violation of the duties they were sent to perform. Their colleagues had a right to separate from them at that point. If they had abjured the prescribed duties altogether — refused to take any part in organizing the bank, or had deputed the three to perform the duties, they would not more effectually have cut themselves off from all right to complain of the proceedings of the three.</p>
    <p id="b193-10" data-blocks='[["BL_193.11",193,[196,1833,1155,340]]]'>Their guilty contract with Robinson is admitted by the demurrer, and it makes an end of this case. Neither they nor the Commonwealth have a right to oust corporators who have come into possession of their franchise in the manner described in the defendants’ pleas. On the state of facts there presented, the decision of the governor, if not conclusive on the judiciary, was a sound one, and is by no means to be reversed by a repeal of the letters patent.</p>

Was he expected to become a party to the agreement with Robinson, and to suffer him to carry off a Pennsylvania franchise for speculative and dishonest purposes? When he had to choose between the proceedings of a majority and a minority of the commissioners, he did well to adopt those that were in substantial accordance with the law and usages of Penn<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>'sylvania, instead of those that were a violation of both, and an indignity moreover to the majesty of the Commonwealth. It matters not that they were the proceedings of a minority of the board. It was a minority that was competent to act under the circumstances of the case, and they were the only proceedings that were worthy of the executive sanction.</p>

The information does not allege any abuse or misuse of the charter. It only charges that the charter was improvidently granted. It is founded wholly on prevenient causes, not on subsequent misconduct.</p>
