In strict law, therefore, the account is regarded as finally settled, and it is only on equitable principles that it can be opened. A bill of review is always founded on these principles, and proceeds according to them, and is never allowed to stand on strict law and against equity.</p>

Such payments do not diminish the estate of the wards, and the absence of the regular legal forms in making them, furnishes no equity for throwing the burden of them on the guardian. These items must, therefore, be restored to the account. Youcher No. 36, for $87, seems also- to have been paid in relief of the estate, and ought to stand as a general credit; and these make the whole credits on the general account amount to $687.23.</p>

The rent for 1830 ought not to exceed $55. Correcting this error, and another admitted one of $100, in the auditor’s report, leaves the whole amount of charges $1000; and, deducting the credits, the balance is $312.77. But the aggregate charges come from rents, and from a legacy to the decedent, payable out of the proceeds of land, and, therefore, personalty. Consequently the widow was entitled to one-third of this balance, and only two-thirds of it, $208.52, belongs to the wards, or $41.70 to each.</p>
