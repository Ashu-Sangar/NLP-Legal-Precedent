The charter of the Bank of Pennsylvania was modelled after that of the Bank of the United States, and it was intended to be the fiscal agent of the state government, as the other was of the general government. The state was a large stockholder, and provision was made for the absorption of the Bank of North America by the new institution, if they desired to subscribe to it and to relinquish their own charter.</p>

This section also provided, that <em>“ </em>the public moneys of the state, as well as those of any incorporation hereafter constituted by authority of the state, shall be constantly deposited in the Bank of Pennsylvania whenever lying inactive.” This provision was not in the act incorporating the first Bank of the United States, but was introduced in a modified form, in relation to the deposits of the money of the United States, into that incorporating the second bank, and formed the celebrated sixteenth section.</p>
