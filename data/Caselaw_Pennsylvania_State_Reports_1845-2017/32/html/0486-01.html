    <p id="b491-6" data-blocks='[["BL_491.6",491,[253,668,1163,251]]]'>The plaintiff, in presenting her claim, as the statute of limitations was pleaded to a part of it, was obliged to go further than the simple <em>primé facie </em>case of proving the two promissory notes ; but as the note for $6000, which was not barred by the statute, is the only one now in dispute, our attention will be confined to that alone.</p>
    <p id="b491-7" data-blocks='[["BL_491.7",491,[256,927,1160,256]]]'>This note produced by the holder, and proved to be signed by the maker, is evidence of a contract, on good consideration, between promissor and promissee. But it is only <em>primé facie </em>evidence, for the law holds that, as between the original parties, such proof is not conclusive; but if not rebutted or controlled by other evidence, it will stand as sufficient proof.</p>
    <p id="b491-8" data-blocks='[["BL_491.8",491,[254,1185,1161,206]]]'>If, therefore, this note had stood alone, the plaintiff might have rested her case on the simple production and proof of the note; and no matter what notice had been given by the defendants, if no further evidence was offered on either side, she would have been entitled to a verdict.</p>
    <p id="b491-9" data-blocks='[["BL_491.9",491,[252,1400,1164,345]]]'>The defendants then produced evidence tending to show there was no consideration given for the note, and this was met by counter evidence going to show that there was a valuable consideration to support it. The question therefore arose, on the whole evidence on both sides, whether there was a consideration for it or not; and the jury would be allowed to gather the proof from that produced by the defendants, as well as that by the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b491-10" data-blocks='[["BL_491.10",491,[257,1744,1158,86]]]'>In this state of the ease, the counsel for the defendants asked the court to charge the jury:—</p>
    <blockquote id="b491-11" data-blocks='[["BL_491.11",491,[254,1831,1162,247]]]'>. “ That the plaintiff, having been notified that proof of the consideration of the notes in suit would be required on the trial, was bound, under the circumstances of this ease, to make such proof; and if she has failed to prove, to the satisfaction of the jury, a valuable consideration for such notes, or either of them, she cannot recover on such note or notes.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b491-12" data-blocks='[["BL_491.12",491,[253,2088,1161,342]]]'>The error in this point is, in not looking at the whole case on both sides, for the consideration might have been proved'by the defendants’ evidence; and, therefore, independent of the generality of the expression, “under the circumstances of the case,” which is clearly objectionable, it would have been erroneous to put the proposition in such language, as would have led the jury to believe, they were to look only to the proof on the part of the plaintiff, for the evidence of such failure, if any there was.</p>
    <p id="b492-5" data-blocks='[["BL_492.5",492,[301,417,1161,122]]]'>
      <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>The answer of the judge shows that such was the construction placed by him on this point, and we believe it to be the correct one.</p>
    <p id="b492-6" data-blocks='[["BL_492.6",492,[300,547,1160,379]]]'>“On the second point,” says the judge, “I answer, there can be no recovery, unless <em>there was a consideration </em>— that a consideration was necessary to give validity to the notes.” This is clear, and covers the case; and he proceeds, “that the failure of the plaintiff to prove consideration, if she has failed, is a circumstance for you to consider, but I decline to instruct you that it is a bar to the recovery;” which is a proper answer, in the mode in which the defendants have framed their point, and asked the instruction of the court.</p>
    <p id="b492-7" data-blocks='[["BL_492.7",492,[299,934,1159,258]]]'>The defendants also asked the court to charge, “ That if A. H. Simmons were indebted to the plaintiff, on the said notes, or either of them, and he afterwards paid to her, or at her request, or with her consent expended or invested money for her use; such payments, expenditures, or investments, are presumed to have been made in discharge of his indebtedness, and not as gifts.”</p>
    <p id="b492-8" data-blocks='[["BL_492.8",492,[298,1192,1161,259]]]'>This was to cover bills paid, drafts drawn, and moneys expended for a kept mistress, by whom he had two children, and whose establishments in Philadelphia and New York, in which he lived with her, were undoubtedly supported by his means. Such households are very expensive, particularly as such connections are generally mercenary, at least on one side.</p>
    <p id="b492-9" data-blocks='[["BL_492.9",492,[297,1450,1158,470]]]'>It is certain, no such interpretation would have been given by the testator, if living, and the court was therefore right in answering, “such a presumption arises when the relation between the parties is of a business character, or where there is nothing to explain the relation between them. When, however, the relation is not that of business, as when money is paid by a father for his son, or by a man for a mistress, other presumptions arise. In the present instance, it is for the jury to decide, whether these payments were payments or gratuities, as a question of fact, upon the evidence, and upon all the probabilities of the case as presented by the evidence.” This disposes of all the errors assigned.</p>
    <p id="b492-10" data-blocks='[["BL_492.10",492,[299,1919,1155,163]]]'>We do not mean to say, that we should have agreed with the jury in all'their conclusions from the evidence, but that was strictly their province, and it is neither the duty nor the desire of the court to invade it.</p>
    <p id="b492-11" data-blocks='[["BL_492.11",492,[1075,2091,334,45]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b492-12" data-blocks='[["BL_492.12",492,[343,2135,454,42]]]'>Woodward, J., dissented.</p>
