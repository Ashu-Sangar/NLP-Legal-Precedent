The goods thus damaged were reshipped at Louisville, on board the Tuscarora, a steamboat, the owners of which are the defendants in this suit. A bill of lading was given for the said goods, by the proper officer of the Tuscarora, to the Concordia, in which it was stipulated that the Tuscarora should not be liable for the damage done on board the Concordia. Neither of the plaintiffs, nor any agent on their behalf (unless the captain of the Concordia could be considered their agent), was present at the execution or delivery of the said bill of lading from the Tuscarora to the Concordia. The said goods were carried by the Tuscarora from Louisville to Pittsburgh, and notice of the arrival given to plaintiffs. The plaintiffs observed that the goods were damaged, and desired to have the amount of the damage ascertained and deducted from the freight, This the defendants refused, and demanded the whole freight stipulated for by the Concordia from New Orleans to Pittsburgh, and refused to deliver the goods until it was paid. Thereupon the plaintiffs paid the said freight under protest, and received from defendants a bill and receipt for the freight as stipulated for in the above bill of lading, signed by the clerk of the Concordia.</p>

This proposition is proved by the counsel’s authorities, but the proposition on which his action rests is, that the second carrier is answerable for the faults of the first. For that, no authority has been shown.</p>
