      <a id="p541" href="#p541" data-label="541" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*541</a>The governor of Illinois issued his warrant for the arrest of the parties, hut the attempt to do so was unsuccessful, as they had previously left the state of Illinois ; and the plaintiff in attempting to make the arrest incurred expenses to the amount of $124.69, for which he brought this suit against the county.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b541-6" data-blocks='[["BL_541.6",541,[231,628,1155,86]]]'>The court below (McOalmont, P. J.) gave judgment for the defendant on the case stated, and delivered the following opinion:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b541-7" data-blocks='[["BL_541.7",541,[224,715,1164,1114]]]'>“ By the Act of 23d September 1791, the expenses of transporting to this state for trial, a person charged with having committed an offence, were directed to be paid by the state treasurer. This was repealed by Act of 20th April 1846, and thereafter, the expenses were directed to be paid out of the treasury of the county in which the offence is charged to have been committed. In both acts, the word transportation is used. In this case, had the person charged with the offence been captured and brought to this state, the allowance would include the necessary expenses of going for him, as well as returning, and there could be no objection to the bill on that score; but it follows not, when the alleged offender has not been taken, that the county must pay the expenses of pursuit; to establish such a principle would be fraught with injustice to the county. The plaintiff was not bound to perform the service, and the contract with him on the part of the state, if it can be assimilated to a contract, could only be enforced, on the ground that the state had employed him for the service. This might be urged to obtain compensation from the legislature, but perhaps not successfully, for the condition upon which the warrant was granted by the governor, was, that the person had fled from the justice of the state, and taken refuge within the state of Illinois. These allegations of fact were at the risk of the informer. Not being true, although not designedly false, the fugitives could not be delivered up, not being within the control of the officers of the state of Illinois. These facts might present a bar to any equitable claim for compensation from the state.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b541-8" data-blocks='[["BL_541.8",541,[224,1828,1160,345]]]'>“ Had the fugitives been actually arrested within the state of Illinois, and afterwards' escaped without the fault of the plaintiff, a ease would be presented in which the state ought, doubtless, to remunerate the pursuer for his trouble and expenses, he being in no default. But even in such a case, it might be, that the state, from motives of policy, would not make the appropriation; for it would be opening the door to fraudulent, escapes, and pretended pursuits, for the purpose of obtaining the compensation.</p>

No claim, we believe, has ever been made for such rewards, unless the offender has been actually taken. It is for the welfare of the Commonwealth, that all offenders be taken, tried, and punished; particularly so in higher felonies; but the <a id="p542" href="#p542" data-label="542" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*542</a>expenses of fruitless pursuits, even in such cases, have never been paid, either by the state or the county.</p>
