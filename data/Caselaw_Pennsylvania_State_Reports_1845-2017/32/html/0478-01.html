There could be no doubt his grace had acted most conscientiously, and with the most sincere desire for the proper discharge of his sacred duties, and to promote the benefit of the church. But in his (Lord Campbell’s) opinion, he had taken an erroneous view of the subject, or had acted on advice which could not be sustained. He was bound to hear the appeal, and he had not heard it. It was one of the first principles of natural justice, that no man should be convicted without first being heard. He (Lord Campbell) would give no opinion, whether the decision come to was right or wrong; but even if the archbishop had come to a decision which was right, without hearing the opposite party, he was mistaken, as it was laid down in that maxim of Seneca, <em>Qui aliquid statuerit parte inaudita altera, cequum licet statuerit, non cequus fuerit. </em>If the archbishop had just cause to affirm the decision of the bishop of London, his judgment could not stand. That had been the uniform principle on which this court, from the most ancient times, had acted; and he recollected hearing a very aged judge once say, and not irreverently, that the Almighty and Omniscient Being would not condemn our first parents without <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>their being heard. That precedent had been always acted upon 32 <em>Law Times </em>230.</p>
