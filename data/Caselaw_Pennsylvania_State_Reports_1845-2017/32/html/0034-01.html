The numerous Acts of Assembly for validating informal conveyances, types of which are to be seen in Barnet <em>v. </em>Barnet, 15 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>72; Tate <em>v. </em>Stooltzfoos, 16 <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>35; Mercer <em>v. </em>Watson, <a href="/watts/1/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Watts 330" data-case-ids="1838095" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0330-01">1 <em>Watts </em>330</a>; and Menges <em>v. </em>Wertman, 1 <em>Barr </em>222, belong to the first class; whilst those acts which authorize trustees and guardians to convert estates in their hands for the benefit of infants, lunatics, and others not <em>sui juris, </em>of which Norris <em>v. </em>Clymer, 2 <em>Barr </em>284, is a specimen, belong to the second class.

It was partition among tenants in common, one of whom had died leaving a will which was contested. All the parties in interest under him, whether the will should be established or set aside, were summoned, and a trustee appointed by the court, to hold for those whose right should be finally established. The Act of Assembly adapted the remedy by partition, to the peculiar circumstances of the parties. That was all that was done in that case, and it was justified on the ground that, when a right exists without an adequate remedy, the legislature may provide one: <a href="/watts/2/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Watts 433" data-case-ids="1840055" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0433-01">2 <em>Watts </em>433</a>.</p>

Here were no parties acting in a fiduciary capacity, who needed an enlargement of powers for the benefit of those whom they represented. No right existed here, lacking a remedy which the legislature alone could supply. But it was simply an authority to strangers, to seize and sell an estate under no obligation or necessity to be sold. It was a legislative repeal of a private citizen’s will. "What becomes of the testamentary power of appointment conferred on his widow by Dr. Shoenberger ? The act does not in terms nullify that. If it exist still, it may be exercised notwithstanding the act. But if it be said, that she has surrendered it by her conveyance, then her children and grandchildren can never take by her appointment, and the fee vests absolutely in the testator’s heirs, subject only to the widow’s life estate.

So tender of private property is our constitution, that it enshrines it with life and liberty, and guards it, even in behalf of a criminal, from legislative invasion. How much more then, the property of the innocent, the absent, the ignorant, and the dependent. This constitutional provision will be applied by these heirs with all the power of a negative pregnant. They will argue with irresistible force that, if the property of a citizen who had forfeited the protection of society, could not be taken from him except in due course of law, much less could theirs, for their claims to protection had never been forfeited or impaired.</p>

Sales of lands for debt, for taxes, to effect partition, and to preserve estates of minors — fines and forfeitures as the penalties for crime — all these are modes of divesture perfectly constitutional, because general laws, prescribed for whole classes of persons, and therefore part of the “law of the land.” But this special, individual, and unnecessary enactment, without constitutional warrant, is no part of “ the law of the land.”</p>

The remainder-men are not before us, except indirectly, nor were they represented before the legislature. They are, therefore, not concluded; for, although their rights are not expressly saved, the act binds none but the parties, as has been repeatedly ruled.”</p>
