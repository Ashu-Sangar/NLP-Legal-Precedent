That the declarations of John Simpson, as proved by Samuel and Abraham Pew, that he intended to make the deed of the land to his wife and children, would not be any authority to Rankin to convey to a trustee for them; and the jury cannot infer from such declarations to the witness, that he made similar statements to Rankin, especially if the jury believe the testimony of Benjamin Alexander and James McKean, that the proposition to convey in trust for Mrs. Simpson and children came from her and Rankin; and when Alexander and McKean both declined the trust because Simpson’s consent was wanting, Rankin did not allege that it had ever been given.</p>

      <em>“ </em>The statute of frauds requires a memorandum of the contract to be put in writing and signed by the party. Here there was a complete memorandum of a contract when accepted, and agreed to by Simpson. But did he agree to it ? If he agreed to it and conveyed the house and lot, he would have been entitled to the two hundred acres. If he agreed to pay the $450, he would have been entitled to either 100 acres. But the evidence shows that he conveyed his interest in the house and lot, and only claimed one hundred acres. This shows that there was some modification of the written agreement; either that it was written while Simpson had the title prior to 1829, or that Rankin supposed at the time that Simpson had the title, or could get it, and afterwards discovered he could not, but had some legal or equitable claim upon Judge Findley for part of the purchase-money, which Findley recognised and was willing to give him the benefit of; or, according to witness McKean, that Simpson had paid some to Findley, and Rankin wanted to save what Simpson had paid, for the family, and to pay off the balance; and that upon this discovery an agreement was made for the hundred acres in controversy. The transaction was so long ago, and the'witnesses who perhaps knew most about it, Judge Findley and Wm. S. Rankin, kind-hearted old settlers, having within a few years gone the way of all the earth,— that we cannot now tell exactly how the facts were. We may assume it as the plaintiff contends.</p>

Assuming, however, that Simpson had an equitable claim to the house, and that it was the consideration for the gift of the land in controversy, we are, nevertheless, of opinion that it was such a modification of the writing as rendered it inoperative as a conveyance or agreement in writing, and made the agreement rest wholly in -parol.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b290-6" data-blocks='[["BL_290.6",290,[352,794,1162,807]]]'>“ If, then, the agreement being in parol, the purchase-money or consideration was paid by Simpson, the question is whether in consideration that it was through his wife’s property he had got the land from Rankin, or from any other consideration, he agreed that the title should be made to his wife and children. If he assented to this, and gave the title that direction, it was competent for him. to do so, and he cannot recover. Or if all the money coming to him from Findley, which he had paid to Findley, or part of it, was his wife’s, acknowledged by him to be invested for her, and to have been conveyed to Rankin for her benefit, then it was competent for Judge Findley and Rankin, with the assent of Simpson, to carry out the arrangement, and for Rankin to make the deed in trust for her and her children, according to the agreement; and if so, the plaintiff could not recover. But if Simpson never assented to this, if he had a contract with Rankin for the land, and performed the consideration and went into the possession, then the deed from Rankin to McKean would be without authority, and would inure to the benefit of Simpson. In that case Simpson would be entitled to recover.”</p>

Rankin, and delivered to plaintiff in 1832, was sufficient to take the case out of the statute of frauds and perjuries, especially as it appeared the plaintiff had taken possession of the land and made improvements in pursuance of that writing, yet nevertheless it was not a conveyance of the legal title, and conferred no more than an equitable interest on the plaintiff. Holding no more than an equity, this action of ejectment is to be regarded as-a bill in equity to compel the defendant, who has clothed himself with the legal title, to convey it, and to surrender the possession of the <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>land to the plaintiff.

Nut at that time Simpson had no interest in the house and lot, having previously released it to Findley. Whether, indeed, he had ever had any might be doubtful; for the mare and saddle which he had given for the lot came by his wife, and though, as the law then stood, these became his property by reduction into possession, still he might convert and invest them for her benefit; and if he did so, equity would support the settlement as against every party but his creditors.</p>
    <p id="b291-7" data-blocks='[["BL_291.7",291,[197,1039,1161,395]]]'>However this may have been, it is beyond all doubt, that when th§ deeds were made to Nankin, Simpson joined only to enable his wife to convey her interest, so that the consideration for Nan-kin’s agreement did not really move from Simpson but from his ■wife. Nankin’s agreement was to give one of the tracts of land referred to for $450; and as the consideration in the deed to hita for the house and lot was $900, it is fair to infer, that half of it representéd Mrs. Simpson’s interest, and the other half Findley’s. _ _</p>
    <p id="b291-8" data-blocks='[["BL_291.8",291,[196,1426,1163,298]]]'>_ _ If this-was the basis of the transaction, Nankin did very well not to convey the legal title to Simpson. Indeed, he had no right to do so. The house and lot once settled on his wife, when these were given for the land in controversy, it belonged to her as fully as they had before. Nankin was bound to secure the title to her, and he did so by conveying it to James McKean in trust for Mrs. Simpson and children.</p>
    <p id="b291-9" data-blocks='[["BL_291.9",291,[199,1726,1160,471]]]'>Simpson must be considered as having assented to this arrangement.

When he employed Maxwell to assert <em>that </em>title, he must have known what had been done; and considering that it was exactly what he had declared his intention to have done, it is too late now for him to undo it.</p>
