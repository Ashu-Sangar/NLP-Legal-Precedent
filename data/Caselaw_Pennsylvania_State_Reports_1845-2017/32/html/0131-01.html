The only matters of description in this warrant are, that it was for 300 acres in Washington township, adjoining Malechia Donnelly. Do these make it a descriptive warrant ? We think not.

This acceptance completed the contract between the land office and Hill, and the warrant being descriptive, and surveyed and accepted, carried his title back to the 4th February 1814, and all this being before any official survey was made on the Moor warrant, the paper title of the defendant is best, and would prevail if that was the only subject in dispute.</p>

Moor’s settlement by his tenants being first, if their claim extended east so as to cover the land in dispute, without an abandonment or consentable boundary with Hill or his tenants, and that claim was kept up until perfected by patent, the plaintiffs here are entitled to recover. But, if the land in dispute was not claimed by Moore’s tenants, or was abandoned, or a consentable line was made with the adjoining settlers, under Hill, and Hill, and those claiming under him, kept up his settlement till perfected by warrant, survey, or patent, then the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover.

On the face of the paper, therefore, the best right would seem to be in the defendants. The survey made of the Moor warrant in 1819, is called a resurvey, and recites a survey made March 19th 1794; but that survey, if ever made, was not returned into the land office, nor produced on the trial. It cannot, therefore, avail the plaintiffs. It is as much the duty of a warrant-holder to return his survey within a reasonable time, as it is to make it on the ground.

As a general proposition, it is unquestionably true, that it is the duty of a settler to define his claim. Entering on vacant land of the Commonwealth he has a-right to appropriate 400 acres and allowance, circumjacent to his improvement, in such reasonable shape as will best suit his purposes, regard being had to soil, timber, water, &amp;c. And because he is a pioneer and generally poor, the Commonwealth has always regarded him with favour, giving him his own time to buy her title, and meanwhile treating his settlement and improve^ ment as a good title against all the rest of the world Of course, it is the duty of a man so indulged and favoured, to lay off the land he means to hold, by lines on the ground, or by the adoption of natural or artificial marks already found there. It is due to the Commonwealth, that she may know what land is for sale, and to other purchasers, that they may not trench upon his pre-emption rights. But if he have failed to perform this duty, a subsequent warrantee or settler may compel him to perform it, by calling on him to designate his boundaries; when, if he neglect to do it, he is not admitted afterwards to complain, that land has been taken away from him which he intended to appropriate.</p>

    <blockquote id="b138-6" data-blocks='[["BL_138.6",138,[306,511,1160,772]]]'>“ When Hess made his improvement, he had a right to take up four hundred acres under it, though he might take as much less as he pleased. And if he had, even in-an unofficial manner, designated his boundaries, however little they might contain, any other person might have taken up all the land without them. But if a settler has made no indication of the extent of his claim, it would be prudent in any other person who means to take up the land near him, to call on him, and request him to mark his lines. If this request be not made, but a warrantee proceeds to make his survey, it must be at his own peril, for in case of a dispute, I know no way of deciding it, but by the opinion of a jury as to a reasonable location of the settler’s tract, regard being had to shape, soil, water, and other circumstances. The settler, it is true, has no right to more than four hundred acres, but the warrantee cannot locate these four hundred acres just as he pleases. The jury must decide between them. But if the settler refuses, on request, to make his boundaries, his conduct is so unreasonable, that every presumption should be made against him.”</blockquote>

As between an improver and a subsequent warrantee, the court were called on to declare the effect of the improvement. The improver had either designated his boundaries, or he had not. If he had, Hill could not take any of the land within them, unless they included more than 400 acres and allowance. If he had not, Hill should have called on him to designate them, before laying his warrant. It was not for <em>him </em>(Hill) to designate the extent of the improver’s rights. But the answers of the court were such as to imply no duty on the part of Hill, whilst Moor’s rights were made to depend more or less on the question of his designation of boundaries. It was not pretended Hill had called on Moor to point out the extent of his claim; yet, in answering the plaintiffs’ second point, the court, instead of an unqualified affirmative, said, it was answered in the affirmative <em>“ if he </em>(Moor) <em>claimed the land in dispute, and designated his boundaries, and kept his claim to the entire quantity without any designation of limit short of the whole, and without any agreement or consentable line with the adjoining settler.” </em>It seems to us, that this was making the efficacy of Moor’s settlement, as <em>against Sill, </em>to depend on his designation of boundaries. It was putting the plaintiffs to prove that Moor must have defined his boundaries, though unsolicited, in order to protect himself against a subsequent warrantee. The law is not so. As between <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>a settler and a new comer, the presumptions are in favour of the settler. If the land in his vicinity is to be taken up, his rights must be respected. He must have a chance to define his claim. And if the warrantee does not give him opportunity, “ he proceeds to make his survey at his peril.”</p>
    <p id="b139-6" data-blocks='[["BL_139.6",139,[171,632,1159,688]]]'>It was strongly alleged that Moor marked his boundaries including less land than he had a right to claim, and there was evidence of marks on the ground. If the old survey which he was said to have made in 1794, had been produced and identified as his work, it ought to have been admitted in evidence, not in aid of the paper title, hut as a circumstance of designation, which in connection with the marks on the ground would have been powerful evidence of the extent of his claim. It should have been treated as part of the <em>res </em>gestee, like the declarations of the occupier in Potts <em>v. </em>Everhart, 2 <em>Casey </em>493. But instead of the original, an unsworn copy of the old survey was the thing offered, and we think properly rejected. This could not be consider as an office copy, because Moor being himself the deputy surveyor, could not make an official survey for himself. If he made a draft, it was a private paper, and if lost, it was to be proved like any other private paper.</p>
    <p id="b139-7" data-blocks='[["BL_139.7",139,[170,1317,1160,216]]]'>Without the old draft, however, there was evidence of lines on the ground, and of assertions of ownership up to them, which most likely would have rendered the qualified answers of the learned judge, to which I have referred, harmless, if it had not been complicated with what was said about a consentable line.</p>
    <p id="b139-8" data-blocks='[["BL_139.8",139,[173,1532,1158,814]]]'>And this brings me to the second topic of remark. In the answers to points, and in the charge of the court, the attention of the jury is frequently directed to the undoubted right of the settler to limit himself to less than 400 acres, by consenting to a line between himself and his neighbours. If there was evidence that Moor and Hill had agreed on a boundary short of the old marks of 1794, and that Hill’s warrant had been laid upon such new line, that was an end of the controversy. The plaintiffs could claim no land which their ancestor had once so distinctly surrendered. But in looking carefully through the case, we can see no evidence of a consentable line. On the contrary, the long-continued improvement of Moor, the claim of all the land up to the salt well — the caveat of 1810 — the ejectment of 1826 — and the payment of taxes, are all indications of adverse relations, rather than of a holding by an agreed boundary. And what is the evidence on which the court submitted this point to the jury ? The plaintiffs had called, Peter France to prove the continuity of the Moor improvement, by Isaac France and others. On his cross-examination the witness delivered the following testimony:—</p>
    <blockquote id="b139-9" data-blocks='[["BL_139.9",139,[175,2346,1156,84]],["BL_140.1",140,[310,415,1157,300]]]'>“ I helped out the timber for the France cabin; France said to us he did not know where the line was, but as soon as Foreman <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>would come, lie would show the line; Foreman came down; Isaac France came along and showed us the line, and read us the letter purporting to be from Moor ; the line was forty or forty-five rods above the cabin, near the mouth of a spring run, that same line Foreman showed us in 1810 — me and Stitt who were making sugar above the line; I was there.under Hill making sugar; Isaac France cut the timber on the lower part below that line.”</blockquote>
    <p id="b140-6" data-blocks='[["BL_140.6",140,[301,714,1163,1241]]]'>This must have occurred before the Hill survey, because Foreman went on in 1807, and was succeeded by Isaac France in 1812, who was there only about three years, and Nightingale, the next tenant, came on in 1817, and was in possession when Hill’s warrant was surveyed in 1818. Of what line, then, did Peter France speak ? Surely not of a line of Hill’s survey, for it had not then been made. But Hill’s application, made in 1814, was founded on an improvement claimed to have been commenced in 1808. Now, although there was no evidence of the improvement claimed by Hill, commencing in 1808, yet before 1810 he may have made some unofficial line to designate it, and of <em>thajt </em>line France may be understood as speaking. And such a line between improvers, if agreed to, would bind them, not only whilst they held as improvers, but after obtaining their respective office-rights. But when was this line agreed upon as a boundary between Moor and Hill ? I cannot find a syllable of evidence of such agreement. Isaac France read a letter from Moor, but what it contained we are left to guess. Did it confess this line ? The witness does not say so, and the letter was not in evidence to speak for itself. Foreman pointed out the line in 1810, but he was only the tenant of Moor, and incapable of changing his landlord’s boundaries without his consent. And <em>pointing it out </em>was not necessarily to confess it, even on the part of the tenant. The witness and Hill made sugar for Hill above this line, and Isaac France cut timber below it. What of such facts ? They prove acts of dominion on the land, but they do not prove this to have been a consentable line. Moor was not present, nor had he, so far as we know, knowledge of these acts. His consent and agreement then are not to be implied from such acts.</p>

They acquire that sort of notoriety in the neighbourhood — there are so many witnesses of the acts and declarations of the parties recognising a common boundary, that tradition is a safer medium of proof on this subject than on most others. Yet in the evidence sent up, we find nothing worthy to be called proof of Moor’s consent to the line in question.</p>

    <p id="b141-7" data-blocks='[["BL_141.7",141,[178,732,1161,292]]]'>The cause must go back to be retried on these points. In dealing with Moor’s prior rights as a settler, it will be of no consequence that his improvement did not adjoin the land in dispute, provided his claim embraced it.
