Yet the defendant, Thomas Crow, wrongfully and unjustly cast and deposited from his sawmill divers large quantities of sawdust, which flowed in large quantities into the stream, and flowed and came down into the dam and mill-race of the plaintiff. By reason whereof the mill-dam and mill-race of the said Evan Jones were and are greatly obstructed and filled up, and he was and is prevented from exercising his trade or business in so beneficial a manner as he otherwise might and would have done, to his disadvantage, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b401-6" data-blocks='[["BL_401.6",401,[190,1173,1159,1157]]]'>“ The circumstances which stand out prominently in the case would appear to be these: The plaintiff possesses a grist-mill on Buck Bun in this county. On the same stream, above the mill of the plaintiff, Thomas Crow, the defendant, is in the possession of a saw-mill, by lease from William Parke, the owner, to the defendant. The whole premises, including both mills, were formerly owned by Joseph Parke, who, in 1818, sold the lower property to Thomas Atkins, retaining the ownership of the upper mill in himself. In 1823, Joseph Parke sold the upper premises to Washington Parke, and thus the title of the two mills became out of Joseph Parke, and in the ownership of different holders. Thomas Atkins held the lower mill for a time, it then went into the possession of David Parke, who resided thereon for a short period, when it went into the possession and ownership of the present plaintiff, Evan Jones, more than twenty-one years ago, to wit, in the year 1832. Washington Parke lived at the upper mill up to the year 1855, or thereabouts, when he sold it to the present owner, William Parke, who has leased it to Thomas Crow, the present defendant. Thus we have the legal possession to the respective premises in the plaintiff and defendant, with the rights and privileges which belong to their respective positions. The question then arises, what are the rights of the parties with respect to the matter controverted ? The two mills, the saw-mill above and the grist-mill below, have been possessed, as you will have noticed, for more than twenty-one years, or indeed more than thirty years. Their legal rights are a question for the court, the evidence and its application to the principles of law are for you.</p>

In <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>virtue of this ownership, he has a right to the use of the water flowing over it in its natural current, without diminution or obstruction.' The consequence of this principle is, that no proprietor has a right to use the water to the prejudice of another. This is the necessary result of the perfect equality of right among all the proprietors of that which is common to all. Every man in this country has an unquestionable right to erect a mill on his own land, and to the use of the water passing through the land, as he pleases, subject only to this limitation, that his mill must not be so constructed and employed as to injure his neighbour’s mill. These are principles which none will contradict, and which are general in their character, yet cases may arise wherein they will not apply. While a riparian proprietor who owns the banks of a stream, has a right to have the water flow in its natural current without any obstruction over the whole extent of his land, yet his rights may be impaired by grant, license, or an adverse possession for twenty-one years. Our Supreme Court has said, and it is the undoubted law, that an uninterrupted adverse enjoyment for twenty-one years, is a title that cannot be afterwards disputed. Such enjoyment, without evidence to explain how it began, is presumed to have been in pursuance of a full and unqualified grant. The .case before you shows, as I have already stated, that old Mr. Parke held both possessions while the mills were on the respective premises, and conveyed the title to the mill below to another, while he still held the upper in his own right. What reasonable inference may be drawn from this fact, that the right for the mill-dam was retained, is for the jury, and may be considered in connection with the presumption arising from length of time. Hence, if the jury believe that for the period of twenty-one years, during George W. Parke’s occupancy of the defendant’s mill, the sawdust thereof was cast into the water and carried down thereby upon the plaintiff’s land, the law presumes a grant of the privilege to do so, and the right thereby acquired is indefeasible. The evidence to the mind of the court is undisputed as to the existence and continuance of that practice ; and conclusively establishes the right. Here, however, it is proper to observe that the plaintiff’s points are true, and are hereby affirmed, that the owner of the land below is entitled to the use of the unobstructed flow of water through his land, and the party who claims the right to obstruct or interfere with such flow by reason of long usage, must prove to the satisfaction of the jury that such obstruction or interference has been continued, exclusive, and with the knowledge and acquiescence of the owner of the land for twenty-one years. The proof in such case should be clear, definite, and unequivocal, both as to the time of enjoyment, and also to the extent of obstruction. It is scarcely denied, indeed it cannot be denied, if the evidence is believed, that the <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>owner of the upper mill has exercised the uninterrupted and adverse right of throwing the sawdust into the stream for more than twenty-one years, and whether with the knowledge and acquiescence of the owner below, must be a question for the jury.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b403-6" data-blocks='[["BL_403.6",403,[229,608,1161,764]]]'>“ The extent of the right must be measured by the enjoyment of it, and he had no right to use it in a different and more extensive manner. The existence of a grant being inferred from usage, it follows that the same usage must determine the extent of it. We know the right, only as we collect it from the enjoyment; and therefore, the enjoyment must be the measure of it. Whether the dust got into the tail-race one way or another, cannot vary the principle; the question is, as to the extent to which it was thrown into the race. It is for the jury to say from the evidence, whether the shute threw more dust into the race or not, inasmuch as when not thrown into the shute it fell either into the race or pit, from whence it was dislodged sometimes by the water, and occasionally, perhaps, being wheeled away. Unless the plaintiff has clearly shown, that defendant during the time he occupied the mill, cast more sawdust into the water than was accustomed to be done by George W. Parke during a like period of time within the said twenty-one years, he cannot recover in this action.</p>

In the year 1818, he sold the lower part of this tract, with a grist-mill erected on it, to Thomas Atkins; and in 1820, or 1822, erected on the upper tract a saw-mill. On the .6th July 1857, Evan Jones, the present owner of the lower tract, conveyed to Atkins, commenced an action on the case for a nuisance, against Thomas Crow, the tenant of William Parke, the then owner of the upper tract and saw-mill.</p>
    <p id="b405-9" data-blocks='[["BL_405.13",405,[199,1186,1160,758]]]'>The injury complained of was, that the defendant wrongfully and unjustly cast and deposited, and caused to be cast and deposited, from the said saw-mill of the defendant, and by the working and use thereof, into and near to other parts of the said stream or watercourse, higher up the stream thereof than the mill-dam and mill-race and other premises of the plaintiff, divers large quantities of sawdust, which there flowed and came in large quantities into the said stream or watercourse higher in the stream thereof than the premises of the plaintiff, and flowed and came down the said stream or watercourse, into the said mill-dam and mill-race of the plaintiff, by reason of which the said mill-dam and mill-race of the plaintiff were and are greatly obstructed and filled up; and the plaintiff is prevented from having the free use of the water of the said stream for his mill, and is prevented from exercising his trade or business in as beneficial a manner as otherwise he might and would have done; and he has been injured in his business, and his said premises have been deteriorated in value.</p>
    <p id="b405-10" data-blocks='[["BL_405.14",405,[202,1953,1158,172]]]'>The saw-mill was at first worked with an upright saw. This continued until 1854, when a circular saw was put up and abandoned, and then two circular saws were put up; but the upright and circular saws were not in operation at the same time.</p>

There is no doubt <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>that an easement like that claimed here, may arise from an uninterrupted adverse enjoyment of more than twenty-one years, and will impose a servitude on the plaintiff’s land of which he cannot complain; because it has arisen from his own acquiescence, during the period which the law has assigned for raising the presumption of a grant of the privilege thus exercised.</p>
    <p id="b406-6" data-blocks='[["BL_406.6",406,[331,660,1156,675]]]'>The judge, therefore, correctly said, “ If the jury believe that for the period of twenty-one years, during George W. Parke’s occupancy of the defendant’s mill, the sawdust thereof was cast into the water and came down thereby upon the plaintiff’s land, the law presumes a grant of the privilege to do so, and the right thereby acquired is indefeasible.” “It is proper to observe,” says the judge, “that the plaintiff’s points are true, and are hereby affirmed; that the owner of the land below is entitled to the use of the unobstructed flow of water through his land, and the party who claims the right to obstruct or interfere with such flow by reason of long usage, <em>must prove to the satisfaction of the </em>jury, that such obstruction or interference has been continued, exclusive, and with the knowledge and acquiescence of the owner of the land for twenty-one years. The proof in such case should be clear, definite, and unequivocal, both as to the time of the enjoyment, and the extent of the obstruction.”</p>
