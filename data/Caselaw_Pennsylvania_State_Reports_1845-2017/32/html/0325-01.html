And there is abundant reason for distinguishing vacant town lots from unseated wild lands in the country. Yery often town lots are vacant, simply because they cannot be profitably occupied as farming or gardening land, for want of civil protection of their produce, and because they are not yet needed for building lots. Often they are unenclosed, because the owners cannot preserve their fences from the spoliations of those who want more comforts than they are willing to pay for. The state cannot for this treat them as unseated, so long as the owners are willing to be personally liable for the taxes on them.</p>
    <p id="b327-6" data-blocks='[["BL_327.6",327,[201,891,1161,433]]]'>This lot was once seated, and was long regularly taxed to the owners as seated, and the taxes paid. It is apparent, therefore, according to the decisions already cited, that it must still be regarded as seated, unless it be shown that it was not only vacant, but abandoned in the sense already indicated. Nothing like this was shown, and of course the verdict could be no otherwise than for the defendant. The owner was personally liable for the tax, he had himself reported it for taxation, and was within reach of the tax collectors, and able to pay them, and nothing like abandonment could be pretended so as to charge the land only.</p>
    <p id="b327-7" data-blocks='[["BL_327.7",327,[199,1322,1164,471]]]'>To make town lots liable to sale in such circumstances, would place men’s titles at the mercy of dishonest collectors, and such speculating friends as should choose to join them in procuring and attending treasurers’ sales. Men who have vacant lots that were once seated land, and that have ever since been taxed as seated, and who have, therefore, been accustomed to pay their taxes to the collector when called on, cannot, with any kind of justice, be subjected to the loss of their property, by the neglect of the commissioners to hold collectors to strict accountability, and in suffering them to return, as unseated, lots that are only casually vacant, without being in any proper sense abandoned.</p>
