The same construction was placed on the revised Act of 13th June 1836, although the words of the 44th section, “ a writ of attachment in the form aforesaid, may be issued against the real or personal estate of any person not residing within this Commonwealth,” were large enough to include legacies and distributive shares.</p>
    <p id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.6",386,[339,958,1160,729]]]'>The legislature, aware of the reasons of policy assigned by the courts for not considering legacies attachable, on the 27th July 1842, passed “ an act to enable creditors to attach legacies and property inherited in the hands of executors and administrators” <em>(.P. L. </em>p. 436), W'hich provided in express terms, “ that all legacies given, and lands devised to any person or persons, by will or testament, and any interest which any person or persons may have in the real or personal estate of any decedent, whether by will or otherwise, or so much thereof as may be necessary to satisfy the demand and costs of claimant, shall be subject and liable to be attached by any creditor or creditors of such person or persons, by writ or writs of foreign attachment, in the hands or possession of . the executor or administrator, or in the hands or possession soever the same may be, as fully and effectually as in other cases; and the like proceedings shall be had, as are prescribed in the several acts of this Commonwealth, regulating the proceedings in actions of foreign attachment.”</p>

Legacies, if no time be limited for their payment, are due and payable at the expiration of a year from the death of the testator, and if the executor has in his hands sufficient assets to pay all the just debts and legacies, he is bound to pay them without further delay.
