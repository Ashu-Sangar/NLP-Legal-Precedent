The means employed in each particular instance, would have seemed to me immaterial, if the result were a transfer in trust, or a trust bottomed on a tra.nsfer; if, in short, the property ceased to be the debtor’s, without vesting directly and absolutely in his creditors, and remained outstanding in the hands of a third person, who could not be compelled to render an account, or to fulfil the duties imposed upon him without a recourse to the aid of equity. In other words, had the question been still open, I should have thought that the law had said to the debtor — You may put your property in any form in which it can be seized, and applied to the payment of your debts, or you may give it to your creditors, because it will then go to pay your debts directly; but you shall not place it in a situation where it shall be neither yours nor theirs, where no execution can reach it, without submitting to those rules and restrictions which have been prescribed for the regulation of trusts of this description, and which would seem essential to prevent them from becoming a fraud upon creditors, instead of a benefit., It would necessarily follow, if this were conceded, that although a debtor might lease or hire the whole or any portion of his property, reserving a stipulated rent or compensation for its use to himself, and might even direct the payment of what was thus reserved to those to whom he was indebted, taking care to make it theirs absolutely, and avoiding the interposition of a trustee, he could not put such a reservation in the form of a trust, nor place the new interest which he had called into being, where it could not be seized by his creditors, without rendering it fraudulent as against them, and giving rise to the mischief which the statutes regulating trusts for <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>the payment of debts were intended to obviate. The transfer of a rent in trust for creditors, would undoubtedly be viewed as an assignment for their benefit, and it would seem immaterial whether the reservation came first and the assignment subsequently, or whether both are the work of one and the same instant.</p>

But the •position thus taken was virtually abandoned in the subsequent case of Guy <em>v. </em>Mcllree, 2 <em>Gasey </em>92, and a fund resulting from the sale of the goods of a debtor, under a judgment confessed by him, in trust for his creditors, held to be insusceptible of an attachment, because the transfer to the garnishee had been effected through the means of a confession of judgment, which, it was said, was not and could not be an assignment; a reason which must be admitted to be undeniable, whatever may be thought of the conclusions deduced from it. It is indeed very plain, that a judgment cannot be in itself an assignment; the difficulty is to know in what respect a transfer through the means of a judgment and execution differs, when actually effected, from a transfer made in any other way.</p>

I therefore concur with my brethren in thinking that we cannot view a hiring or letting as an assignment, consistently with the doctrine held in Guy <em>v. </em>Mcllree, because the rent is reserved in trust for the payment of the lessor’s debts, and thus placed beyond the reach of an attachment by his creditors, without being directly vested in them. If it be said, that this opens a door for the evasion of the rules by which trusts for the benefit of creditors are regulated, that debtors may make long leases of their property, with a clause requiring the lessee to apply the accruing rent to the payment of debts in a prescribed order, and subject to such <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>conditions as the lease may impose ; I can only answer, that the objection applies with as much, if not more force, to a transfer effected through the means of a confession of judgment, followed by an execution, under which the whole of the debtor’s property is turned into cash, and placed in the hands of a trustee, beyond the reach of his creditors. In construing a statute, the presumption should always be, that nothing has been left out, which is necessary to give it effect, but when the highest court has once declared judicially that such an omission exists, the gap cannot be supplied by inferior tribunals. The rule for a new trial is discharged, and judgment entered for the defendant on the point reserved.”</p>
