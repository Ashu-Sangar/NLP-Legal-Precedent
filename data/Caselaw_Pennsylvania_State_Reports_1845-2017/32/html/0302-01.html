    <p class="summary" id="b303-11" data-blocks='[["BL_303.11",303,[225,1464,1162,85]]]'>Answer — “ This point is sufficiently answered in answer to the first point.”</p>

What, then, was the character of Mrs. Dawson’s possession? She claims under the will of her mother, Mary Hemphill, who was one of eight children of St. Clair Gibson. Her possession, from the evidence, can be regarded only as the possession of herself' and her brothers and sisters, and not for herself exclusively; and one tenant in common can only recover in ejectment his or her own individual share or interest in the land.

That if the parties, Gibson and Thompson, in 1805, agreed upon the Armstrong line, or any other line, as the dividing line between them, and five years after-wards the deed given in evidence was executed and delivered, if it embraced some twenty-four or thirty acres more than the quantity originally agreed upon, the jury might presume, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that they intended to abandon the former line, and that the division line should be moved further to the south, so as to correspond with the calls of the deed. That as they had power to fix a line they also had power to alter or shift it at pleasure, and if they did fix it in 1805, as alleged by plaintiffs, still if they afterwards changed it, according to the testimony of Mrs. McGeary, and made it to correspond with the courses and distances in the deed, the former line, of course, would be thereby annulled, and those claiming under the Thompson deed would have the legal title. But if the parties agreed upon a line in 1805, and afterwards adhered to it, notwithstanding the courses and distances in the deed, and "continued to claim and hold, according to that line, after the execution and delivery of the deed, during their lives, that line would be binding upon their heirs and those claiming under them; and the plaintiff would be entitled to recover, notwithstanding the land turned out to be embraced in the deed. But the proof, in that case, of the original agreement in regard to the line, and its subsequent adoption or the acquiescence in it by the parties, should be established by clear and satisfactory evidence.</p>

But they were not evidence to show an agreement between Gibson and himself to hold by a different line than the one on the ground, by which he had been holding; or in other words, to show that he had a right to shift his line. The offer, however, was to give the evidence in connection with what had already been proved in regard to the declarations of Gibson. It is possible, that these declarations, already given, may have been such as to render material and proper the evidence offered and admitted, and now complained of as error — we have not that evidence in the bill of exceptions or otherwise on the paper-book. It .lies upon the party alleging error to show it — it will not be presumed. This exception is not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b305-9" data-blocks='[["BL_305.15",305,[175,1524,1160,516]]]'>Thompson purchased the land, the lines of which are in controversy in this suit, from Gibson, the ancestor of the plaintiffs, about the year 1805, and the parties employed one Armstrong to run off Thompson’s purchase by a line between them. In 1810, Gibson conveyed by deed to Thompson the land purchased, but by courses including more land than the Armstrong line gave him. But it'appears that during Thompson’s lifetime, he held and occupied by the Armstrong line. It was proved, that Thompson said in 1810, that he was to have a different line, hut that he would never claim to it during Gibson’s lifetime — and it would appear that neither Gibson nor Thompson, during their lives, for a period of thirty years, claimed by any other line.</p>
    <p id="b305-10" data-blocks='[["BL_305.16",305,[173,2039,1159,383]],["BL_306.1",306,[323,401,1161,337]]]'>■The learned judge of the District Court refused to answer the plaintiff’s first and second points in the affirmative, which in substance affirmed the law to be, that if the parties had caused a line to be run between them on the ground, they and those claiming under them would be limited by the line, and that such a line on the ground would govern the courses and distances in the deed. These propositions the learned judge declined to affirm, but charged, “that if the parties, Gibson and Thompson, in 1805 agreed upon the Armstrong line or any other line, as the dividing <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>line between them, and five years afterwards the deed given in evidence was executed and delivered, if it embraced twenty-four or thirty acres (nineteen it should have been) more than the quantity originally agreed upon, the jury might presume, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, that they intended to abandon the former line, and that the division line should be moved farther south, so as to correspond with the calls in the deed.”</p>
    <p id="b306-6" data-blocks='[["BL_306.6",306,[321,745,1158,852]]]'>We think there was error in this instruction in' the abstract, and especially so in its application to this case. It gave the jury the power to find according to the line of the deed, notwithstanding the line on the ground, and notwithstanding the parties who caused it to be run, held by it for a period of near thirty years. Two great facts in the case, which, without clear evidence to the contrary, should have controlled the result, were by this instruction rendered inoperative, in favour of the courses in the deed. In official surveys the lines on the ground control the courses and distances in the patent: 4 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>456; 6 <em>Barr </em>478. In <em>Blasdell v. </em>Bissell, 6 <em>Barr </em>258, Gibson, C. J., after asserting this principle, asks, “ why shall they not constitute the boundaries of a grant by an individual ?” and after applying the rule to the case in hand, which was that of a deed made six years after the survey, including, as in this case, a greater quantity of land than that embraced in the survey, adds, “ it would be most unjust to let the grantee avail himself of the surveyor’s inaccuracies and the scrivener’s omission, in order that he might take in more land than he paid for, or was set off to him, and the judge should have told the jury that the law would not allow it.”</p>
    <p id="b306-7" data-blocks='[["BL_306.7",306,[322,1604,1157,514]]]'>This is a case very similar in principle and fact to the one now under consideration. In our ease, the deed was made five years after the survey; it includes more land — and there is nothing on our paper-books to show that any more was paid for than was contained within the Armstrong line; but the deed was simply allowed a controlling effect, because it differed from the line on the ground. This, the law, without more, will not allow. Besides, too, the line was sustained by the fact of acquiescence in it, and the respective claims of the parties making it, in accordance with it, for a great number of years, and as long as they lived. The deed alone could not prevail against the joint force of these facts, and there was error in the charge that it might.</p>

The line on the ground, notwithstanding the excess in the deed, would control the deed until there was evidence to show that a different line was adopted by the parties. More <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>particularly so in this case, where there was long acquiescence in it. On the question of a change of line, the deed would be some evidence, but alone it would, as we have seen, not be sufficient. It would be stronger or weaker as other facts and circumstances indicating a change might tend to show intent evincive of it. But a change of the line must be shown, or the one on the ground will control. For these reasons the judgment must be reversed.</p>
