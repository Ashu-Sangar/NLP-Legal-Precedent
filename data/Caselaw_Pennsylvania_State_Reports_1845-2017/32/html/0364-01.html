The defendant Nathan Taylor was named in the praecipe, but was not served with process, and the jury was not sworn as to him. The other defendants pleaded not guilty.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b364-16" data-blocks='[["BL_364.14",364,[314,1770,1160,643]],["BL_365.1",365,[210,406,1169,733]]]'>“ The declaration of the plaintiffs sets out that they were joint owners, and that they jointly have suffered injury by the conduct of the defendants. Although this objection is somewhat technical, it is undoubtedly true, that the allegation and proof must agree. A suit cannot be maintained when it is brought in the name of one man, and the property is alleged to be his, if the evidence discloses the fact that it belongs to another. In the case before us, the allegation is, that Taylor Brown was part owner of the horse in question, in connection with another plaintiff, Townsend Brown, and the suit is brought in the name of both. The defendants aver, however, that as Taylor Brown is a minor, he could not enter into a contract for the purchase of the horse; and that, if he could so make a contract, the proof is insufficient to show that he did it. It is further alleged by defendant’s counsel, that as Taylor Brown is a minor, no presumption of ownership arises from pos<a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>session in him, and the proof of ownership is insufficient. So far as these defendants are concerned, they cannot set up the minority of Taylor Brown to defeat the action. Taylor Brown was in possession of the horse when the injury was inflicted. He had, on more than one occasion before, been in possession of him in a way which implied ownership, and I 'hold that these acts of ownership constitute evidence for the jury. If such evidence, together with the testimony of the witnesses to this point, shall be considered by the jury sufficient to establish the fact of joint ownership, then the allegation and proof agree, and the action is sustained. I might, in the terms wherein they are conceived, affirm the foregoing points, leaving it to the jury to say Avhether the evidence is or is not sufficient. In doing so, I should not have answered the argument of counsel, that in a case of a minor no presumption of ownership arises, and the proof must be clear and conclusive to the fact. Believing as I do, I prefer to deny the proposition as applied to the case before us.”</p>
