Our alternative mandamus, founding itself on the matters charged by the relator, recites an Act of Assembly of 1849, incorporating the Pittsburgh and Steubenville Railroad Company, and a supplement thereto of 26th February 1853, authorizing the county of Allegheny, through its commissioners, and upon the recommendation of one grand jury, to subscribe an amount not exceeding ten thousand shares to the capital stock of said company, to borrow money to pay therefor, and to make provision for the principal and interest of the money so borrowed, as in other cases of loans to said county. The writ further recites the recommendation of the grand jury of June Term 1853, that the county should subscribe an amount not exceeding ten thousand shares to the capital stock of said company — the fact of a subscription of six thousand shares, and the issue of bonds therefor in the gross amount of $300,000, in amounts respectively of one thousand dollars each, and that the two bonds of the relator, issued as part payment of said subscription, were transferred by the railroad company, in conformity with the aforesaid Act of Assembly of 1853, as well as of two other acts approved March 2d 1855, and March 27th 1855.

    <p id="b222-3" data-blocks='[["BL_222.5",222,[286,1396,1155,382]]]'>Such is the relator’s case. It is an appropriate case for <em>mandamus. </em>He does not ask that judgment be rendered for him for the amount of the unpaid interest, but simply that public officers —the fiscal agents of the county of Allegheny — clothed by law with the power of assessing and collecting taxes to the extent of one cent in the dollar of the adjusted valuation of taxable property in the county, shall be required to provide means for paying that interest in the same manner they provide for paying other debts of the county.</p>

The Acts of Assembly relating to county rates and levies, impose no specific penalty upon the commissioners for the neglect of such duties as the relator calls on them to perform, and if a penalty were provided, it is well settled that it would not supersede the remedy by <em>mandamus. </em>If the relator were demanding <em>payment </em>merely of his interest, he might, indeed, sue by action of debt, but so might every holder of any of the three hundred bonds, and thus every six months would bring down upon the county an avalanche of lawsuits that would be destructive to her treasury. And a remedy that would require three hundred creditors to sue twice a year for interest, could scarcely be regarded as adequate. The law is bound to furnish some better means, even if immediate payment were the thing sought. Rut where that is not the immediate object, but the relator only seeks to put the county commis<a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>sioners in motion to execute duties devolved on them by law, neither the action of debt, nor any other ordinary action, is adequate. I need not consider whether he had any remedy in equity, for according to the best authorities, both English and American, the existence of an equitable remedy is not a ground for refusing <em>mandamus.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b223-5" data-blocks='[["BL_223.6",223,[202,671,1166,1501]]]'>Although <em>mandamus </em>is usually spoken of as an <em>extraordinary </em>remedy, and it is so in the sense that it lies only where there is a clear legal right, and no adequate remedy for it at law; yet since the time of Lord Mansfield, it has grown into great use in England, and the effect of the various decisions is said to be, that the Court of King’s Bench, as the general guardian of public rights, and in exercise of its authority to grant the writ, will render it, as far as it can, the suppletory means of substantial justice in every case, where there is no other specific legal remedy for a legal right; and will provide, as effectually as it can, that all official duties are fulfilled, whenever the subject-matter is properly within its control. Originally, <em>mandamus </em>was a mere letter missive from the king to a subordinate functionary, commanding the performance of his duty — then it became a legislative power — and finally was committed to the Court of King’s Bench as a judicial remedy, and as such, it has been extensively and beneficially applied. Thus, it is a general rule, that whenever an act of Parliament gives power to, or imposes an obligation on a particular person to do some particular act or duty, and provides no specific legal remedy for non-performance, the court will, in order to prevent a failure of justice, grant the writ to command the doing of such act or duty. The books abound with instances of the writ directed to inferior courts, magistrates, and local authorities, commanding them to execute acts of the legislature. So, the Ordinary has often been commanded to grant letters testamentary and of administration ; bishops to institute clergy; aldermen and burgesses to proceed in the execution of their official duties; incorporated companies to execute charter-powers; and churchwardens to make and raise one or more rates for the repayment of money and its interest, borrowed on the credit of the parish. It lies also to command a municipal corporation to enforce payment of existing borough rates, and to make and cause to be collected another borough rate wherewith to pay instalments on a composition bond ; and in a case in <em>Strange’s Iiep. </em>63, it was held to lie commanding the making of a county rate.</p>

The irrelevancy of this will be seen, not only from the general views hereafter to be expressed in reference to the third plea, but from the absence of any allegation on the part of the relator that the grand jury recommended any “ given amount.” He does not allege it, and he was under no necessity to allege it, for the Act of Assembly did not require the grand jury to specify or designate the amount of the subscription. The act authorized the county to subscribe an amount <em>not exceeding ten thousand shares, on the recommendation of the grand jury. </em>The relator charges that the grand jury recommended a <em>subscription not exceeding ten thousand shares, </em>and that the commissioners made a subscription of six thousand. It is manifest,'that the plea meets nothing contained in this charge, and amounts to nothing as a defence, because the law did not impose on the grand jury (as in the case of Mercer County <em>v. </em>The Pittsburgh and Erie Railroad Co., S <em>Casey </em>390) the duty of <em>“designating” </em>the subscription to be made.

The respondents do not deny that the certificates or bonds were executed and delivered in satisfaction of the subscription. The county has got the stock, which was the consideration of the subscription. The certificates or bonds on the face of them pledge the <em>“faith, </em>credit, <em>and property </em>of the county” for the payment of both principal and interest. The pledge is as absolute for the interest as for the principal. It was a public loan, on the faith of the public credit. Such loans are common, hot only on the part of our general and state governments, but among all organized states of the civilized world, and there is no sentiment on which mankind are more united than on the inviolability of such public pledges. And the sentiment is very sound; for repudiation of public obligations is sure to be followed by social disorders and general decay of private morals. A pledge of the public faith ranks as an imperfect obligation, because no action at law ordinarily lies to enforce it. The state or community may furnish a qualified remedy against itself; but unless it do so, the contract is remediless. Everything beyond this must be referred to the arbitrament of the sword. But, because all ordinary remedies are lacking, the obligation is considered all the more sacred. In the revolution of governments, whatever dynasty goes up or down, the public debt remains, and is always recognised by the existing government.

Owing to this belief, the opinion just delivered appears to my mind inadequate, because it does not adequately treat the fundamental question of the cause.

They are a people as sincerely devoted to the order of the state as any other, and as little inclined to reject the acts of their government as any people in the world. But they have been forced by circumstances into a review of the fundamental principle of this case, and I think that they are entitled to hear something from us in relation to it. They have gone back into the moral questions that lie at the foundation of all authority and law, and I am willing to accompany them there.</p>

Now it is a question of the validity of contracts, in which the law is only one of the elements.</p>

These laws were to have no operation without the assent of grand juries drawn by lot from the body of its citizens, and of the county commissioners elected by ballot to manage its financial affairs. This assent was given on many occasions, and the contracts were made; and on the faith of them, with other means, two railroads were constructed, and four others commenced. None of these things were hidden from the people of Allegheny county, for they were not done in a corner, but openly before the public; and all participated in them that chose to do so. Newspapers and public meetings freely discussed the subject, and the hopes of the people bore down all doubt about their right to enter upon the adventure, and it was only when it was discovered to be unsuccessful that any respectable number became awake to the question of the constitutionality of their proceeding.</p>

Now, therefore, we are not to look upon the Act of Assembly as being the only authority for the issue of these bonds, or to suppose that they are to be set aside — even if the unconstitutionality of the act were fully demonstrated. If the constitution has been violated, it has been done by the combined act of the government and of the people that were interested in the question. It is, therefore, a mistake of the people, as well as of their functionaries, in relation to the meaning of their own frame of government; and the question now is, who shall bear the consequences of the mistake ? — they who made it, or those whom they induced to trust in them — they who actually or tacitly set aside or misunderstood their own constitutional principles of social authority, or the stranger, who trusted that the united conduct of the people and of all their officers was a safe exponent of their principles ?</p>

If one puts another in a <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>position that gives him an apparent authority, others may trust to the appearance, though it may not truly express the real authority vested in the agent.

Even a usurping government has authority over those who submit to it, to bind them towards other persons and nations. If it be in fact the government, it may do all acts of government, though in moral principle it ought to have no authority. It binds the nation by its acts, and all the people who constitute the nation, whether they assent or dissent.</p>

So far as relates to strangers, the exercise of authority is proof of its legitimacy. If it were not so, every person, and every government, having occasion to treat or contract with another government, would have <em>a right </em>to investigate and decide upon its legitimacy. More than this ; since nations have a <em>right to demand treaties </em>of each other, in order to regulate their intercourse, each would, on this theory, have a right to demand that the other should have a legitimate government, that could enter into a valid treaty; and this would often furnish an excuse for a strong nation to dictate a form of government to a weaker one.

We select one from Grecian history, perhaps an extreme one. When the Thirty Tyrants, an unconstitutional and usurping government, in the last days of its. existence, and as a means of saving itself from the returning constitutional democracy, borrowed a large sum of money, the restored Athenian democracy, taking a large view of the question, resolved to pay the debt out of the public money, and did so as soon as an exhausted treasury and impoverished country allowed it.</p>

This is an essential incident of society, and of human nature. Man is made for society, and is morally bound to associate. He cannot otherwise fulfil his destiny. He is therefore bound to <em>give form </em>to society, that .is to institute government and live under it. He cannot reject government because its form does not please him. The best government that a given association of men can make, must be legitimate for them and for the time. Even .those who object to it must bear with others the consequences of its defects. This is a natural necessity. In the present case, this people, with as good a form of government as they know how to make, have brought upon themselves this evil, and common justice forbids them to throw it over upon others.</p>

Is property more valuable than government, and peace, and order ? Property, without government, is good for nothing; because property is never cared for, or sought after, or valued when acquired, when it is unsecured by social order and the saeredness of social forms. In savage life, and in lawless societies, property is valueless, because it has not these securities. According to these forms, as society has honestly understood them, and under their highest sanction, these contracts stand approved as valid contracts of the county. To repudiate them now is to cast down the very safeguards of liberty and property. It is to fly from evils that we know and can measure, to those which the future only can reveal. When, after the battle of Arginusas, the victorious generals, with barbarous neglect, left their dead uncared for, and abandoned their yet living comrades to perish, with their disabled ships, the Athenian democracy departed from their accustomed judicial forms, in order to hasten their condemnation; but they afterwards sorely repented of it, and Kallixenus, the senator who led them astray,driven into exile and detested by all, died of hunger.</p>

A people does not act upon these principles only — perhaps not at all on some of them — but on the faith that is in them, and upon the common customs and principles that constitute the atmosphere of their social life. Locke’s Carolina Con<a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>stitution, and the French Constitutions of the Revolution, and the various systems of socialism, were the product of these scientific principles, and they perished as soon as applied to the life of the people.
