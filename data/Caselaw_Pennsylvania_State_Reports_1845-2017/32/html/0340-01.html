The Pittsburgh - and Steubenville Railroad Company was the company spoken of at the time.

It becomes important then to inquire whether it was sufficiently authenticated to form the basis of a recovery. As to the first eight names, including the defendant’s, it is clear from its face, that this book is not an original, but a copy of some other book or paper. Although it was proved before the book was offered in evidence, that these names were in the handwriting of Lewis, yet the writing‘in pencil, both at the head of the list and under several of the names, was not discovered until afterwards, owing to its being nearly obliterated at the time. The mere fact of the names of such men as Edwin M. Stanton, E. D. Gazzam, W. A. Hill, the treasurer of the company, James Gray, Charles H. Paulson, and Charles Naylor, being written by Mr. Lewis, is enough of itself to stamp the character of the book. Who would suppose for a moment that any one of those gentlemen, if presented with a subscription book and requested to take stock in a railroad company, would ask another to write his name ? And yet this book is gravely offered as an instrument of evidence, upon the theory that the defendant’s name was written therein by his authority, or that it was subsequently ratified by him. No proof whatever is offered of the existence of an original, nor any search made in the office of the company, or elsewhere, for any such book, and, therefore, it is difficult to perceive upon what grounds this book, which in no aspect rises higher than secondary evidence, can be admitted. The simple proposition is to give in evidence what purports on its face to be a copy of a contract, without first proving the existence and loss of the original.</p>

Mr. Vonbonhorst, the secretary and treasurer, says it was <em>some time </em>after January 1855 — but whether that expression means one month, one year or more, we are not informed. It might have been a day, a week, or a month before the case was tried. The company was either ignorant of its existence when the present suit was brought, or had no faith in its authenticity, because the action as we have seen was brought on an entirely different sort of contract. But Mr. Lewis never regarded this book as an original subscription book, so far as those eight names are concerned — otherwise he would have taken measures to secure himself against the imputation of forgery, by providing the necessary evidence of his authority to write their names, or their express approval after it was done. He did, no doubt, what many of those commissioners, it appears, were in the habit of doing. Each one gathered up all the names that could be found in any book, or attached to any paper purporting to be a subscription, and placed them in his own book, in order to show who had taken stock in this company, as an inducement to others to do likewise ; and finding the name of Dr. Gazzam to the paper upon which this suit is brought, supposed himself justifiable in placing his name in the book as a stockholder. This is no doubt the true explanation of this affair, and if this be so, it tends to show that when Dr. Gazzam presented this book to Chambers for his signature, his own name was not in the book, because Chambers subscribed after Jacob Weaver, who attached the date, viz., 14th July 1851, to his signature, which is the date of the paper signed by Gazzam, on which this suit is brought. The strong probability therefore is that Lewis saw this paper, some time after Gazzam returned the book to him, and Copied the name therefrom into it.</p>

      <em>“ </em>If this view of the case <em>be </em>correct, it disposes of the question of ratification, and cuts up the plaintiff’s case by the roots. For, if Mr. Lewis did not place the name of the defendant there for the purpose of binding him as a subscriber to the stock of this company, then there was nothing to ratify — nothing to adopt. Lewis had done no act for Gazzam, or in his name, and of course there could be no adoption or ratification. Ratification of a contract is ‘ an agreement to adopt an act performed by another for us. By ratifying a contract a man adopts the agency altogether, as well what is detrimental as that which is for his benefit:’ <em>Bouv. L. B., </em>title Ratification. The relation of principal and agent is necessarily implied by the term ratification. Now if these names were merely copied into this book by Mr. Lewis, from different books or papers, on his own account, and not with a view of affecting or binding the defendant, the relation of principal and agent could not exist, and consequently the idea of ratification is <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>entirely excluded. But if this were otherwise, the rule is well settled, that a full knowledge of all the material facts and circumstances attending the transaction is necessary to give validity to the ratification; and the party must know that he would not he hound without such ratification. Now let us suppose that Mr. Lewis had undertaken, without any authority whatever, to make a subscription to the stock of this company for the defendant when he wrote his name in this book, is there any evidence from which a jury would be justifiable in inferring, that the defendant ever knew, or had any reason to suppose, that his name was in that book? The only time when it was clearly traced to his hands was when he presented it to Chambers. Chambers was not asked whether the name of the defendant was in it then or not. From this omission we may clearly infer that if he could have proved the fact, the question would not have been omitted. And if the array of influential names, now on that first page, had been there then, is it likely he would not have seen them, or that <em>the </em>defendant would not have called his attention to them? More especially when he said he had subscribed himself, would he not have shown the list of names, as an inducement to Mr. Chambers to take stock ? And again, if his name had been there at that time, with his knowledge and assent, as an absolute subscription, why would he execute and deliver to the commissioners, and why would they accept the paper of the 14th of July 1851, in the form and with the conditions of that instrument ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b348-3" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[286,1471,1156,587]]]'>“ But why should we be left to strained inferences and forced conclusions, on a point regarded by the plaintiff as vital to their cause ? When they had it in their power to clear up all doubts on this point, by calling up Mr. Lewis himself, who is in full life, and resides within sight of the court-house ? But, it is suggested, that being a stockholder, he was incompetent as a witness. So was Mr. Chambers a stockholder, but by assigning his stock he became competent, and so might Mr. Lewis. But it was for the defendant to object to his competency, and not the plaintiff. Perhaps no objection would have been interposed, and then we would have had the whole transaction disclosed in its true light. It was their duty to have called Lewis, and if objection had been made by defendant, the inference would have been shifted to the other side.</p>

This evidence is so slight, as, in our opinion, to be entitled to very little weight. But if those entries and figures were clearly proved to have been made by the defendant, they would be no evidence of a ratification of that which we have already shown was not the subject of adoption or confirmation. The same may be said of the defendant’s declarations, proved by Follansbee. All the declarations proved by Chambers and Follansbee, in relation to the defendant’s subscription to the <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>stock of the company, may very fairly and truly be referred to the paper signed by him, on which this suit is brought, as they were all after its date.</p>

But a contract of subscription must be in writing, and cannot be established by parol evidence: Pittsburgh &amp; Steubenville Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Clarke, 5 <em>Qasey </em>146.
