They are not to suffer, and languish, and want, and die, and perish without necessary raiment, and food, and medicine, and Christian burial, except by the charity of the few who happen to witness their anguish and suffering; but there is a duty devolved upon the public to maintain them, and alleviate their misfortunes, or to compensate those who come forward in the hour of need and perform these duties.

If you believe that Earrell was poor, and unable to pay for the services rendered to him by the plaintiff, and that the calamity that happened to him was so sudden, and the necessity for immediate relief so pressing and urgent, that it would be unsafe to await the slow process of an adjudication of two justices, before the performance of the services, then we think the county would be liable for services thus performed, even although no order was procured at the time.</p>

The constable acts as a public officer, as a coroner does upon an inquisition upon a dead body when he calls in <em>the </em>services of a physician. He has no right to receive the moneys nor the services of a physician, as others attending upon the pauper. And in acting thus in his official character, he merely discharges a public duty, and incurs no pecuniary liability.</p>

This is the general rule, and this case is not an exception. But in the present case, if the position assumed by the defendants’ counsel was even correct, it would not avail him under the pleadings in this case.

And in sustaining the recovery, Huston, J., p. 96, delivering the opinion of this court, suggests, that the obligation created by law renders the directors liable in <em>assumpsit. </em>The pauper is not to lie and suffer, and perhaps die, in consequence of want of prompt relief, upon what might be denominated the etiquette of the law; first, notice to the justices, next their meeting and consultation, and finally the issue of the order for the required relief. It is the necessary care of an actual pauper that forms the consideration, while the promise to pay for it is implied from the legal duty imposed. In Overseers <em>v. </em>Bunn, the liability is indicated to be ope that can be enforced as a contract, express or implied.

So in Bradford <em>v. </em>Keating, 3 <em>Casey </em>275, an action on an implied <em>assumpsit </em>was sustained for maintenance afforded for a period of nearly two months previous to the order of removal or notice. These, and many other analogous cases that might be cited, are all predicated upon the same docrine of implied <em>assumpsit, </em>arising from the legal obligation or duty.</p>
    <p id="b183-6" data-blocks='[["BL_183.6",183,[227,856,1166,1547]],["BL_184.1",184,[278,392,1170,1622]]]'>We will next inquire whether the Acts of Assembly, relative to the directors, the plaintiffs in error, have relieved them from any liabilities. It is scarcely supposable that the people of Westmoreland county, in asking for this special law, or the legislature in granting it, intended any indulgence or exemption in. or from the discharge of moral and social duties. The Act of 1849, <em>Pamph. Laws </em>354, is the first on the subject, and declares, • especially in the third section, that the directors “ <em>shall provide all things necessary for the lodging, maintenance, and employment of the poor.” </em>This language is full as comprehensive as that of the general law. In the eighth section the directors are prohibited from establishing any rules and regulations conflicting with the legislative enactments; and the seventeenth section limits the repeal of former laws to such only as are by this act altered or supplied. The general intent and purpose of the previous law's are in no particular altered or supplied, but very carefully preserved. It was only the machinery for carrying the same object into effect, that was even attempted to be changed. The duties of the overseers of the poor, under the general law, were merely transferred to these directors. In the third section of the supplement of 1852, <em>Pamph. Laws </em>276, they are prohibited from paying funeral expenses or other charges on any order for relief, obtained after the death of any pauper, if there were previous thereto five or more days wherein it could have been obtained. By a familiar rule of construction, the implication would seem to be, that such expenses and charges, undel <em>all other </em>circumstances, are to be paid, and to be paid, too, by <em>them, </em>and not at any time by a constable or other officer, although the pauper may not have been removed to the house of employment, nor even entered upon the poor-books, as directed by the law in ordinary eases. But it is contended by the plaintiffs in error, that the second section of this same supplement makes the constable the paymaster, and exclusively responsible in the first instance. This, however, cannot be the true rendering of this section. Such a construction of it would be a torture of language and perversion of the law from its true intent and meaning, and inconsistent wdth the entire policy of the <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>system. It would be more complicated, inconvenient, and embarrassing than the old system of township overseers. Under this section it is simply the duty of the constable to see that the humane purposes of the law are executed in these cases of emergency. In this he acts merely as the agent of the directors, contracting for them and on their credit. There is not a word used indicating that he shall pay. The law provides him with no funds. He is-to furnish no vouchers nor settle any accounts, but he is <em>to notify the directors of the facts of the case, as soon as convenient, whose duty it is to provide for the payment. </em>A specific fee of fifty cents is given the constable for his services as such agent, and the usual mileage. This is all he receives and all he is to do. In case of neglect, he is subject to indictment and a limited fine. The whole of these provisions are merely directory. His performance creates no liability, on the part of the directors, towards the relief afforded the unfortunate pauper, nor does his neglect exonerate them from any: there is no intimation of the sort anywhere in the law. The liability results from the necessary services rendered in the emergency. The spirit of the law is to afford ready relief for the poor. This is the main object of it. The protection of the treasury is but a secondary one. Hence, even if the construction we give the law were a doubtful one, it ought to be maintained. The necessary services then having been rendered, under the emergency, and the order for relief obtained within the time limited, as appears to have been the case here, the law implies all the rest necessary to sustain the action. It then has about it all the legal essentials of other indebtedness, and is certainly equally meritorious. The general principle requires the debtor to seek out the creditor and make payment. Neglect to do this subjects the former to an action. We see nothing here requiring the application of any different principle. The evidence, however, shows that the plaintiff below caused his claim or bill to be presented for payment to the directors before suit brought. The objections to payment, then made, were very different from those urged now. This recovery is essentially upon a <em>quantum meruit, </em>under the sole plea of <em>non assumpsit. </em>Upon any aspect of the case, both upon principle and authority, we think the court below committed no error.</p>
