The injunction asked for was what is called, in the practice of that state, conservatory process; the object of which is to keep things in <em>statu </em>quo, pending the decision of some issue. The cases in which it is allowed, are specified in articles 296 to 303 of the. <em>Oode of Practice. </em>The scope and- operation of the conservatory process of injunction are very extensive under art. 303.
