By the same instrument, the intended husband covenanted with the trustee, that he would not oppose, at any time thereafter, directly or indirectly, or obstruct, litigate, or defeat the uses and estates therein declared, nor any future revocation or change of the same, or any declaration or appointment of uses, which his said intended wife might thereafter, either by deed or will, declare: <em>Held, </em>that this covenant did not confer on the wife a power to revoke the uses declared in the marriage settlement, either by deed or will.</p>

After providing for the appointment of trustees, in case of death or refusal, the instrument closed with the following covenant: “And the said Stephen Ammidon (the intended husband), for himself, his heirs, executors and administrators, doth hereby covenant, promise, grant and agree, to and with the said Allin Robinett, his heirs, executors and administrators, that he the said Stephen Ammidon shall not, and will not oppose, at any time hereafter, directly or indirectly, obstruct, litigate, or defeat the uses and estates hereinbefore limited and declared, or any future revocation or change of the same, or any declaration or appointment of the uses which the said Maria Quesnet may hereafter, either by her deed or deeds of indenture, or by her last will and testament in writing, or by any writing in the nature of a will, agreeable to the tenor and the true intent and meaning of these presents.”</p>

Then, if it be immaterial in what part of the deed the proviso is inserted, and indeed it is so, the fair construction of the whole deed taken together, is that an estate for life was reserved to the father, and an estate in remainder granted to the pauper.”</p>
