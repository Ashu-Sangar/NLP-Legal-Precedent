The only questio'n is, as to the proof of such an intention. In general, as we have already seen, by the law of England, and of most of the states of America, the receipt of a promissory note of the debtor, for a debt, is, in the absence of all other proof, treated as a conditional payment only of the debt; that is to say, if, or when, the note is paid. But if the note is intentionally received as absolute payment, the original debt becomes thereby extinguishedsee <em>Ohitty on Bills, </em>10th ed. 1859, p. 119; <em>Smith’s Mercantile Law, </em>6th ed. 1859, p. 542.</p>
