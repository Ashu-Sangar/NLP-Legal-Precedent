    <p class="summary" id="b71-6" data-blocks='[["BL_71.6",71,[221,560,1170,346]]]'>“ The defendant claims the land by the statute of limitations. For all the purposes of this case, the deed to Miller, in 1820, may be treated as if never offered in the ease. His title was divested by adverse holding. It is not set up as a defence here. It is true, that the title to the land was in .Miller, at the death of the father, but the adverse holding began under him, and was perfected by his family. The land, therefore, really descended to his family, at his death, in equal parts.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b71-8" data-blocks='[["BL_71.8",71,[215,1034,1171,1287]]]'>“ One tenant in common may oust his co-tenant, so as to obtain title by statute, although they may have surrendered the possession under a mistaken impression of their rights. But the possession must be adverse, uninterrupted, and notorious, and by clear, positive, and unequivocal acts of open denial of their rights, and by keeping them out of the land. And what a man may do in this respect himself, he may do by his tenants. Here the defendant seeks to make out the period required by statute, by adding the possession of his co-tenants to his own — persons who, at their father’s death, had an equal share in the land with himself, and, according to defendant’s views, by their own act, lost, and he gained, the title. The widow7, and most of the children, made frequent declarations, after the old man’s death, that the land was Samuel’s; that they had nothing to do with it; that they did not claim or own it. But they seem to have been labouring under the impression, that he had the right under the purchase from his father. In speaking on the subject, they usually concluded it with the payment, by defendant, of his father’s debts. George and his mother were, for many years, the sole occupants of the land, after the father’s death; they paid no rent, as far as we can learn from the evidence. Defendant, during that time, made some repairs and paid for them. In 1837, Barnhart had the land as defendant’s tenant, and by defendant’s direction he handed over the thirds to George and the mother. In 1842, Walter says, they admitted to him that they were Samuel’s tenants. Shortly after this, he went into possession. The plaintiffs say, that, if the heirs, who remained on the land, did so under the mistaken impression that defendant was the true owner, by purchase, from his father, and made the declaration under the same delusion, defendant cannot claim them as tenants.</p>

He left a widow and a number of children, the <em>eestuis que trust </em>of the plaintiff, and the defendant. The widow, and George, one of the sons, with some of the younger children, continued in possession, occupying and farming the land, receiving and using the products, up until in 1842. In that year, the defendant having got married, moved on to the place, and George and his mother surrendered the possession to him. This was the commencement of his personal occupation of the premises. In 1855, the plaintiff purchased the land, under proceedings in the Orphans’ Court, for partition, commenced by one of the heirs, and holds the <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>title in trust for the heirs of Samuel Deetz, Sr.; and in the same year instituted this ejectment for the recovery of the premises.</p>

    <p id="b73-7" data-blocks='[["BL_73.7",73,[182,1577,1164,807]]]'>In the case in hand, it was claimed that the jury might find an ouster by Samuel Deetz of his co-heirs, from the declarations of George and his mother, while in possession of the land, and of some of the other heirs at different times; and so thought the court, and left the fact of ouster on this evidence to the jury. These declarations consisted in George saying, frequently, that the place belonged to Samuel; that his father had given it to him, because he paid debts for him. The mother said the same thing; and they both said at several times, that Samuel could turn them out of possession. It appeared also, that Samuel leased the place one year, in 1838, while George and his mother were in possession, and that Barnhart, the tenant, by his direction, paid the rent, the one-third of the crops, to the widow. There were also declarations by both George and his mother, that they had nothing to do with the land. After Samuel took possession, in 1842, George, it appeared, worked on the place; and his declarations were proved, to the effect that Samuel paid him for his labour; but the witness says further, that George was the active man on the place, and owned the cattle and horses.</p>
    <p id="b73-8" data-blocks='[["BL_73.8",73,[226,2392,1115,43]],["BL_74.1",74,[314,415,1171,1759]]]'>This was the character of the evidence relied on by the defend<a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>ant, to establish an ouster of his co-tenants and title by the statute of limitations. To arrive at this result, it was necessary on part of the defendant, to claim that these declarations eonstituted George and his mother tenants of Samuel, and to presume that they had been turned out of possession by him shortly after the death of his father, and were held out until they came in again on condition alone of holding for Samuel, against themselves and all others. All this was claimed as a presumption from the declarations in evidence; an ouster to be established; thenar of the statute to be raised by these parties against themselves and their co-tenants whose possession they had never resisted; and all from mere talk, without an act, on part of the alleged disseisor. Potent words, and full of vast meaning, and vaster consequences! Notwithstanding the impossibility of producing such results by such totally inadequate means, as we have shown from principle and precedent, the court seems to have recognised the possibility of it by charging on this hypothesis, for there was no other, “ that one tenant in common may oust his co-tenants, so as to obtain title by the statute, although they may have surrendered their possession under a mistaken impression of their rights, but that the possession must be adverse, uninterrupted,” &amp;c. It was scarcely worth while to speak of a surrender, with no better proof of it than that which arose from the declarations, 'that the property was Samuel’s, and he could turn them out. But, independently of this, there was error in the idea that the giving up the possession under a mistake was a disseisin — an ouster. It wanted the element of action on the other side. A turning out, adverse claim, and defence of the disseisor’s rights. For all that appears, the case had but imagination to bolster up the idea of anything else than a' fanciful surrender. But, even if there were a surrender in mistake of rights, this would indicate a voluntary yielding of possession, and w7ould be no ouster. We see nothing in the case that is evidence of an actual ouster of George, nor is there a <em>“ </em>shadow of a shade ” of anything of the kind in regard to the other heirs. If there were no ouster -established by the tests of law, then there was no point at which the statute of limitations could commence running in the case; for the possession of George, and afterwards that of Samuel, was without doubt the possession of the co-tenants. So that the defendant had no case against the title of the plaintiff on the principle upon which it was placed.</p>
