When the final decision is made, directing the payment of a sum of money by one party, and the conveyance of the land by another, the equities between them are taken to be fully adjusted, and no subsequent action of covenant for the rents and profits can be entertained. It is the policy of the law to put an end to litigation, and to avoid circuity of action. It is still more clear, that where one is in possession, under a legal title, with a full right to retain both the possession and the title until the purchase-money be paid, he cannot be regarded as a trespasser during his rightful occupancy of the premises, and therefore no action of trespass for mesne profits would lie against him.</p>
