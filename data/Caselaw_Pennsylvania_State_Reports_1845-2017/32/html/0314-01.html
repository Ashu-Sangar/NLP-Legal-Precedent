McVay, against William A. Irwin, Samuel Baird, and Alexander McClurg. The cause was arbitrated by agreement of counsel, and on the 23d November 1857, an award was made in favour of the plaintiff for $637.90, on which judgment was entered.</p>

And on the hearing of this rule, the court below ordered that the judgment of revival be opened and the defendants let into a defence; which was here assigned for error.</p>

The error assigned on this record is to the action of the District Court, in opening a judgment obtained by the plaintiffs in error against the defendants in error, by submission and award, alleged to be under the Act of 1836. There has been no final judgment as yet in the case, and <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>as the act complained of is neither the entry of judgment nor an order in the nature of a judgment, it is not the subject of a writ of error. Acts within the discretion of the courts are generally not reviewable, unless perhaps in a flagrant case of wrong, which is very unlikely to occur. If an interlocutory proceeding be injurious, it may be examinable after final judgment in the case, but not before. "We cannot review the act of the court in opening this judgment, and the writ of error must be quashed.</p>
