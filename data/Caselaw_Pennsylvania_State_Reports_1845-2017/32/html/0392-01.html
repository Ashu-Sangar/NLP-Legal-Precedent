This is clearly not the meaning of the word, when applied to the present case, where this relation did not exist, and where the transaction is simply a reloan of the name. It is distinctly sworn to by both these defendants, that these notes were the renewals of the original notes; that is, as we understand it, it was a continuing loan of credit through a series of years, forming but one transaction, and of course secured by the mortgage which was given for this very object.</p>

We believe this reaches the real justice of the case, as every tribunal before which it has been heard in various forms, has arrived at the same conclusion. The appellant suffers no other injury than that of not having made a successful speculation.</p>
