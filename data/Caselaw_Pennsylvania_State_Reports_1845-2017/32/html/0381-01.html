    <p id="b382-13" data-blocks='[["BL_382.19",382,[318,1679,1161,346]]]'>Is this a valid ground of exemption? We think not. There is nothing very poetic about tax laws. Wherever they find property, except what is devoted to public and charitable uses, they claim a contribution for its protection, without any special respect to the owner or his occupation, and without reflecting much on questions of generosity or courtesy. They leave no discretion to the taxing officers by which any exemption can be allowed; for if they did, favouritism and corruption would soon publicly abound.</p>
    <p id="b382-14" data-blocks='[["BL_382.20",382,[318,2024,1159,254]]]'>Clearly the liability to taxation does not depend upon the intention of any one relative to his domiciliation, for this would make the state’s power of taxation dependent, in numberless cases, on the pleasure of the persons proposed to be taxed. Residence is a definite and obvious fact, and is of itself a sufficient ground of liability.</p>

But the officer’s household furniture, not within army quarters, stands as much in need of state protection as any other kind of property, or as the property of any other person. What is official about the plaintiff here is his surgical and medical function, and that is not taxed. As an owner of household furniture or other property (not being special instruments of his office), he stands on common ground with other residents and citizens, and is subjected to corresponding burdens and duties.</p>
