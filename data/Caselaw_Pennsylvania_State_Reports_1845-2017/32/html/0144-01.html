Honest men, who could foresee results only according to their wishes, and who were not sufficiently sceptical of the flattering schemes of sanguine projectors, nor sufficiently experienced in the interested and purchased representations of professional borers, to spurn them with disgust, such men, for the most part, passed the laws which have resulted so disastrously; and similar men gave them effect by making the subscriptions. Most of them acted honestly for the public benefit, and according to the best of their knowledge; and they fall not at all into the class of men who have been knowingly faithless to their trusts to the great injury of the public.</p>

If the people cannot select wise and good men for important offices, they must expect sad deficiencies in performance, and must be ready to take much of the blame to themselves, and to accept the consequences of their mistakes. To an honest discharge, by every officer, of his public functions, and to an earnest desire and effort to be fit to perform them, the people are entitled; but they are not entitled to any greater capacity of performance than the officer possesses, <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>when elected, or can reasonably acquire in the short time usually allowed him to learn his duty.</p>

The railroad projectors had a hearing, and the people had none; yet this is a very common way of dealing with the people’s interest, by officers "of a much higher grade than county commissioners. Wherever legislation is carried on, there projectors and speculators congregate in multitudes, and. their opinions and wishes are often quite efficient even against manifest public interest; and even professional borers are there regarded by some as fit companions of gentlemen and honest citizens. Though this is politically and morally a great wrong, yet we are not authorized to declare it illegal; the remedy will no doubt be some day provided by the legislature, for they see the evil as clearly as others do.</p>
    <p id="b151-6" data-blocks='[["BL_151.7",151,[178,1212,1155,471]]]'>Public business is itself a source of public demoralization, whenever it allows itself to be urged on by the presence and promptings of private interest. Men of reflecting and experienced honesty hesitate in approaching public officers, in relation to matters in which they are individually interested, lest they should be suspected of desiring to practise improper means of influence; and if less thoughtful and less honest men are allowed such advantages, then even good citizens are tempted to imitate their example, in order to prevent the advantages of government from being monopolized by the unworthy. In such contests, however, honesty always has the disadvantage.</p>

If they were cheated by relying on such opinions, we have no authority to relieve them. It might have been otherwise, if they had demanded information relative to the facts that were necessary in judging of the expediency of the proposed subscription, and had been falsely informed of them; but we do not discover that they sought any such information. They ought not to have relied, as a ground of their action, on the hopes expressed by the railroad officers.</p>

They were issued and delivered to the company; but the county has never acted as a stockholder, <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>has never voted at any election, or been represented at any meeting, and has never received any certificates of stock.</p>

This was an essential condition of the contract. On no other terms, did or could the county contract with the company to become stockholders. It was a gross and manifest fraud in the company, thus to deal with the bonds of the county. It was a violation of the county’s rights as subscriber, and a plain violation of a known Act of Assembly. It is equivalent to offering them $64 of stock for every $100 which they have promised by their bonds to pay with interest. If the bonds had been sold at ten per cent., the case would be the same in principle, but more striking. Then the county would have an actual stock investment of $20,000, as a compensation for the $200,000 which they are to pay by the terms of the bond, with semi-annual interest.</p>
