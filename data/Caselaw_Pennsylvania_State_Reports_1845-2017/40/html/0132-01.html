A judicial sale of the land, as the property of either Green or Shoenberger, upon the judgment of a third person, would not have extinguished the charge in question: Dewait’s Appeal, 8 Harris 236.

The payment of that debt, under the terms of the agreement, was adjudged to be the principal consideration of it, and, therefore, in the case of an unexecuted contract, signed by both parties, held to amount to a covenant to pay it. It was very unlike the case of a deed conveying the legal title subject to a charge, which adhered to it in its various stages of transmission to the present owner, under the will of Dr. Shoenberger.</p>

J., says the true rule of interpretation is the intent of the parties. This of course denied to the words, <em>per se, </em>the effect of a covenant, or a personal promise to be liable. Many reasons, derived from results which might flow from holding them to have the force of an agreement to pay, are given in that case, proving what has already been said, that such a conveyance does not, <em>pier se, </em>imply a personal covenant to pay without regard to the enjoyment of the property.</p>

But Mr. Justice Rogers denied what has sometimes been asserted, that buying, subject to encumbrance merely, created no privity of contract. That the assignee, and so Avith his successors, Afere liable for ground-rent only on privity of estate arising <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>from the “ actual or beneficial enjoyment of the premises, or the right of possession and enjoyment.”</p>
    <p id="b139-6" data-blocks='[["BL_139.6",139,[170,476,1165,507]]]'>These authorities are sufficient to establish, beyond doubt, that the words in the <em>habendum, </em>in the deed by Green to Dr. Shoenbergcr, “ <em>subject also to the payment of the doiver of the widow of Valentine Hay, deceased, and which the above tract of land was subject to in the hands of the said Samuel Green,” </em>do not, of themselves, the deed not being sealed by the latter, import a covenant or a promise by acceptance of it, to be personally answerable to discharge the dower. The dower having become due and payable after the doctor’s death, and after the estate had passed by devise to Mrs. Duncan, upon no principle of privity of contract or estate is his estate answerable to discharge the encumbrance.</p>
    <p id="b139-7" data-blocks='[["BL_139.7",139,[175,991,1165,766]]]'>As we see no indication whatever, outside of the words used, evincive of an intent to make the payment of the decree a personal obligation by the testatór, we are clearly of opinion that the case must be reversed. It is not, in principle, distinguishable from Bell’s Executors <em>v. </em>Bell, already cited, and which followed abundance of authority, as appears by the citations therein. In the case in hand, the dower was not even counted as part of the purchase-money. That was $825 for the land, “ subject to the payment of the dower,” <em>ko,., </em>“which is $562.82.” “I have no doubt,” says Gibson, C. J., in Walker <em>v. </em>Physic, “that they actually meant no more than to say the grantee was to take an encumbered estate, without recourse to the grantor for a breach of the statutory covenant arising from the words “ grant, bargain, and sell.” And the fact that the encumbrance was not included in the purchase-money, is a strong circumstance that this was the understanding of the parties. I need do no more than to notice one or two cases relied on by the defendant in error.</p>

Shrum sold to Campbell, by articles of agreement, an equitable title, which agreement both parties signed and sealed. By these Campbell agreed to buy, for a consideration to Shrum, “ subject to the payment of the <em>purchase-money </em>and <em>interest now due, </em>on articles of agreement between Thomas Netly and James Gibson of the one part, and the said Shrum of the other part.” It is evident that the principal consideration for the sale to Campbell by Shrum, was, that the former should discharge the arrears then due by the latter, and for which he was liable to be called on at any moment. It was the evident intent apparent in the covenants, as appears in the opinion of the court, Avhich led to the ruling there. No one can doubt its propriety, I think. But it does not conflict with the case in hand. The dower was not <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>payable when Dr. Shoenberger bought, nor did it become so in his lifetime. The estate came to him charged with it, and it is evident he took it to hold as encumbered.</p>

We may dismiss it with the only remark remaining, in view of the case before us, and that is, that the point there decided was that covenant does not lie against a party who has not signed or sealed the instrument sued on. No point of that kind arises here. This was an action of debt, and as there can be no doubt but that it would lie in all eases for the recovery of a specific sum of money, we see no objection to the form of action.</p>
