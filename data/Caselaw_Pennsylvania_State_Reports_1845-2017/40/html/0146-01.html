That proposition may be stated thus : That, whilst mere omission of a creditor to sue the principal debtor does not discharge a surety, yet when the creditor has the means of satisfaction either actually or potentially in his hands, and does not choose to retain it, the surety is discharged. What it is to have the means of satisfaction actually or potentially in hand, must be gleaned from the eases. Thus the levy of a <em>fi. fa. </em>on personal goods of the debtor, as in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Miller’s Adm’rs., 8 S. &amp; R. 457, and in Bellas <em>v. </em>Haas, 16 Id. 252, was to possess the means of satisfaction, and a release of the levies worked a discharge of the sureties. So when the surety applies to the creditor, and apprises him of any legal means of recovering his debt, and he declines, upon demand made, to pursue it, whereby the opportunity of being paid is lost, the surety is discharged : Lichenthaler <em>v. </em>Thompson, 13 S. &amp; R. 157. Or if suit be brought by the creditor which might result in satisfaction, but is discontinued against the consent of the surety, as in Bank <em>v. </em>McAllister, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20149" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 149">6 W. &amp; S. 149</a>, the surety is released.</p>

The debt was against Daniel Keim. He assigned the means of paying it to Benneville Keim. Richards, as the surety of Bonneville, promised that he should faithfully apply those means. The assignee’s possession was, as between the debtor and creditor, the possession of the debtor rather than of the creditor. The debtor appointed the assignee, and though he became trustee for the creditors, it was a trust created and limited by the debtor for his own benefit. Benneville Keim and his sureties were substituted for Daniel Keim. The assets of Daniel were in their legal and their actual possession. But the creditor might have obtained payment by calling for his money. It was set apart and ready for him, and, though actually in the hands of the assignee, it could be had for the asking. Grant that this was extraordinary and unreasonable inaction on the part of the creditor, it was not possession actual or potential of the means of satisfaction, and thus the main proposition of counsel fails of its application.</p>

No; because the rule is well settled that mere forbearance, however prejudicial to the surety, will not discharge him.

Webner’s claim had become a debt of Benneville Keim. His estate was ample to pay it, and was in process of liquidation for payment of all his debts. Erill had only to come in and receive his money at the hand of the assignee of Benneville Keim. He neglected to do it. Was this the release <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>of a potential satisfaction, like- the staying of a <em>fi. fa., </em>or the discontinuance of a suit? We cannot think so. For the reasons before given, we consider it mere indulgence — unreasonable inaction — which the surety ought to have quickened into activity by notice to the creditor. He knew, or had the means of knowing, that his principal had not paid the Webner debt. It was negligence in him to stand by and see the estate of his principal scattered without providing for this ascertained claim, or giving the creditor notice to secure it. The utmost he can impute to the creditor is inaction, not release of anything in possession— and the cure for inaction was in the surety’s own will. Whenever he chose to require the creditor to move, the creditor would have been obliged to put himself in motion, and further inactivity would have discharged the surety. But until he gave the word, and he never gave it, he acquired no legal defence, from lapse of time, to the plaintiff’s claim.</p>
