This case is noticed <em>arguendo, </em>in Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Lloyd, 1 Vesey Senior, p. 33, S.

In the Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Andrews, 1 Vesey Sr. 225, the testator made his will before the statute of mortmain, devising his copy-hold lands to a charity. He had some copyhold surrendered to the use of his will, and other copyhold not surrendered, all of which the Lord Chancellor held were included by the terms of the will. To the objection of the mortmain act, he replied, the doctrine already settled, saying, “ this will was made before the day on which the act took place, and all the cases arising before must be left on the same rules of law and equity.” To that of the Statute of Frauds, he cited the case of Tuffnel <em>v. </em>Page, April 1740, 2 Wms. 262 (S.

There the will was dated 3d June 1831, and the testatrix died on the 7th July 1837, and her will was proved in Baltimore on the 10th of the same month, and on the 17th letters testamentary were issued, upon an exemplification filed in the register’s office for the city and county of Philadelphia, to Caspar Souder, the executor. After the date of the will, the testatrix disposed of two messuages and lots which she owned, one in the city and one in the county of Philadelphia, and reserved to herself and her heirs two annual ground-rents; and the question was whether these ground-rents passed by the will. She did not republish her will.</p>

The broad question was therefore presented to the court, whether this will was to be governed by that act, the existing law at the death of the testatrix, or by the law as it stood when she executed her will. It was a subject the whole court was familiar with, and three of its members had given opinions upon branches of this subject. Judge Sergeant answers this question by saying that the act does not apply to a will dated before its passage, where the testator died subsequently. <em>“ We </em>think, however,” says he, “ that it does not. It could only do so by giving the act a retroactive effect, which will never be done, when such does not expressly appear to be the design of the legislature, but the Act of Assembly will be left to operate on wills made and executed after the act comes into operation.” After quoting most of the decisions on the mortmain act, used in the cases of 5 and 6 Watts, and which I have stated more at large, he uses this language : “ There, the application of the statute” (of mortmain) “would have abridged the right of the devisee; here, it” (of 1833) “would abridge the rights of the heirs : and there seems no difference in principle.”</p>

The question is, did the legislature intend that the act should operate on wills executed before its passage, the death happening after, so as to change by the construction the legal intention of the testator ? For I agree if this intention clearly appear, it must be so construed: it would interfere with no vested right, as the testator is saved the power of directing otherwise. It however strikes me that the intention must be most clearly expressed in language which it is difficult to misapprehend; and such is the doctrine held in Mullock <em>v. </em>Souder, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0198-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 198" data-case-ids="478141" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0198-01">5 W. &amp; S. 198</a>.

Mullock <em>v. </em>Souder, it is true, is the case of real estate, and as this is assumed to be personal property, it does not in terms rule this case, nor is it in this case cited for that purpose, but for the sake of the principle decided, which is as applicable to personal as real estate. Nothing appears, but rather the reverse, in the Act of 1844, indicating any intention to give it a retrospective effect. No devise or legacy <em>hereafter made, </em>is the phraseology of the act, thereby meaning, according to the usual acceptation of language, wills made and executed after the passage of the act.” After discussing the will of personal property, including <em>ex necessitate, </em>all the testator had at his death, and the legatee intended when the will was made, and granting the constitutional power of the legislature, he says: “ but is it going too far to require that such intentioñ shall be expressed in such clear, unambiguous terms as to preclude all hesitation and doubt? It is, in my judgment, giving the act a retroactive effect, which, as is ruled in the case cited, Mullock <em>v. </em>Souder, will not be permitted, unless such appears expressly to be the design of the legislature. Though a will, it is true, does not take effect till after the testator’s death, yet it is inchoate, though not consummate from the execution of it, and, for many purposes in law, of which this is one, it relates to the time of making it.”</p>
