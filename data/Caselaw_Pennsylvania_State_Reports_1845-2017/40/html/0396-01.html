The street is some fifteen feet higher than the adjoining land.

The íavo lower stories of this house are built of brick, nine inches thick. In Avet weather the Avater accumulates and stands on the rear of the two lots. In the spring of 1859, Hutchinson commenced filling up his lot, and employed Rourke to deposit upon it the earth which he was excavating from a lot or lots on the side of the adjoining hill, in order to bring the lot up to within eight or ten feet of the grade of Magee street, the usual height for the bottom of the cellar. In doing this the earth necessarily came in contact with the side or cellar wall of the house belonging to Schim<a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>melfeder, and, as he alleged, caused the same to spring and crack, which was the trespass complained of.</p>

He cannot so fill up his own lot as to let the earth pass over his line on the lot of his neighbour; and if the latter has built a wall and erected a house within his own line the former is not at liberty either to build to his neighbour’s wall, or throw earth against it so as to spring it out of line or do it any other injury, and if he does so he is responsible in damages. If the plaintiff’s house was built of improper materials, and the injury to the walls resulted from that cause, the plaintiff cannot recover for that injury. In other words, if the injury to the walls was not caused by the defendant heaping up the earth against them he cannot recover for that injury, but still the plaintiff would be entitled to recover nominal damages, at least, if the defendant covered up for several feet the small strip of ground between his line and the wall of his house, and this is an answer to defendants’ first point. In answer to the second point we have to say that there is no evidence in the case tending to show that the plaintiff was under any obligation to grade his lot up to the street or to any other grade, nor that he was guilty of any negligence or breach of duty in that respect.”</p>

Com. 128. These are said by the same author to be irrevocably secured by <em>Magna Gharta; </em>by the statute <em>de confirmations chartarum; </em>the Habeas Corpus Act; the Bill of Rights, and lastly, by the Act of Settlement, after the Revolution. With us these rights are secured by the constitution of the state and United States, and thus being defined, we distinguish constitutional from arbitrary or despotic governments. The light of private property, as defined by the same authority, consists “in the free use, enjoyment, and disposal of all acquisitions, without any <em>control </em>or <em>diminution, save only by the laws of the land:” </em>Id. 138.

This not requiring any concession to the defendant, the latter was without the shadow of right in carting earth and dirt upon his premises. If, therefore, his acts occasioned injury to the plaintiff, it was right to hold him answerable to the extent of the injury. It was no excuse for his trespass that he could not with equal facility, or at the same cost, fill up his lot to the grade of the <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>street, without carting a portion of the material on plaintiff’s lot. He was, by a moral as well as legal obligation, bound to use his property so as not to injure that of the plaintiff. If he could not act in accordance with this principle, he could not lawfully act at all. We think the judgment of the court on the points of the defendant were expressed entirely in accordance with the law, and the answers given to the jury faultless.</p>
