According to the express terms of the association, it seems to us that the new stockholders were to be at least equal sharers in the capital, and that they must have purchased on this supposition; and equity will not assume inequalities or preferences in such matters further than it finds them contracted for. The old stockholders have contracted for a preference out of the profit, but not out of the capital stock or basis of the operations of the company, and there is nothing revealed to us that satisfies that they ought to have it.</p>

Yet we do not consider that vote as binding on the rights of any; for, however majorities may bind in the conduct of a concern, they can decide no one’s rights in the act of settlement and distribution. Even when the by-laws or articles give the largest control to majorities, they mean this only as power in carrying on the business and not in its dissolution and distribution among the members. The resolution declaring how distribution shall be made is not binding because of any. by-law giving authority to alter or amend the articles, but only because it is right, or in accordance with the relations existing among the stockholders.</p>
