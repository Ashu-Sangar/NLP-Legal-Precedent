In 1793 the surveyor who had made the survey for Green made three other surveys on warrants to William Adams, Dr. Young and Robert Gray, two of which call for Green as an adjoiner. The official distance of the northern line of the Adams tract as returned, is the same as that of Green, while the western line of Gray’s survey is the same as the eastern line of Green. Marks of the date of the Adams and Gray survey were found on their lines where Green is called for as an adjoiner, and the theory of the plaintiff upon which he based his right to recover, was, that the survey of Green being called for by the surveys of Adams and Gray, the Green tract extends to the surveys which call for it as an adjoiner, unless there are marks found on the ground corresponding with the Green survey to restrain it, and that after the lapse of so many years as intervened between the return of this survey in 1793 and the application of Cleaver, without any interfering claim, the law will presume that the surveys adjoin each other, and that there is no vacancy. The defendants on the other hand contended that the legal presumption after twenty-one years have expired since the date of a survey, is, that the survey is made on the ground as it is returned into the land office, which presumption limited the holder of the Green tract to his official distance, in the absence of marks on the ground corresponding with the date of the survey extending the linos beyond the official returns; that the call in the junior surveys of Adams and Gray cannot enlarge or abridge the boundaries of the Green tract, and that locating it according to its official courses and distances, the vacancy claimed for the Cleaver warrant and survey remains.</p>

These facts would seem to tend strongly to show that the southern line of Green is identical with the northern line of Adams, and that the eastern line of Green is identical with the western line of Gray. The plaintiff contends that the southern and eastern lines of Green were never actually run, but were left open until the surveys of 1793 were made, when they were designated and fixed by running and marking the boundaries of these adjoining surveys. If this be so, then there was no land applicable to the Cleaver warrant, and the land surveyed in it is properly embraced in the plaintiff’s survey. The question then in the case is narrowed down to this: does the evidence in the case satisfy you that the southern and eastern lines of the Green survey are identical with the lines of the Gray and Adams survey ?

The authority of the deputy was exhausted by the return: <a href="/yeates/3/0399-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Yeates 399" data-case-ids="6774450" data-case-paths="/yeates/3/0399-01">3 Yeates 399</a>; <a href="/binn/2/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Binn. 55" data-case-ids="1788983" data-case-paths="/binn/2/0055-01">2 Binn. 55</a>; 7 Barr 72. Thenceforth the boundaries would remain, unless changed by the authority of the land office. It follows, therefore, that the mere act of the deputy for other parties and at another time, could not produce the effect of enlarging the survey — that he could not effect a result indirectly, which it will not be pretended he could do directly.</p>

It is certainly not a natural presumption, that an act not done in or about the latter, but exclusively for the former, <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>shall be intended as-done for the latter, and so materially to affeot it. . It would do violence to common sense to hold this to be so ; nor can it be claimed to be a presumption of law, which is artificial, without showing authority for it. The presumption that the survey was made as returned, stands until it is overturned by facts; but the assurance presumptive of the plaintiff neither disproves it nor touches it. “ <em>Stabit presumptio, doñeo probetur in contrarium.”</em>

    <p id="b268-6" data-blocks='[["BL_268.6",268,[296,736,1175,1361]]]'>On the authority of Sweigert <em>v. </em>Richards, 8 Barr 436, these junior surveys of the Adams and Gray warrants were received as the declarations of a deceased artist, who located the Green tract, and who it was claimed had afterwards located them. This was on the principle of hearsay evidence in regard to boundary. They were perhaps evidence in this aspect of the case, but it was going very far to say they were “powerful evidence,” as the learned judge thought that the Green lines had been actually run just where they were found. It would be strange that the junior lines were to be found on timber still standing, on and near them, and not a single mark to be found of the survey made four years before. In the presence of such a fact as this, the declaration of the deputy in making these returns, that they were on the actual lines of the Green tract, is, to say the least of it, not powerful. This fact, and the incongruity between the courses, distances, and corners of the Green survey, as returned, and these junior surveys, induced the jury to disbelieve that the lines of the former and latter had been run on the same ground. About this part of the case, however, we have no point before us for review. The only use and effect to be given to these returns on the trial was given, in submitting them as hearsay evidence of boundary. As calls they have no effect to enlarge the boundaries of an older survey, and to this point is Carbon Iron Co. <em>v. </em>Rockafeller, 1 Casey 55. “ The adjustment of the lines of a younger survey,” said Woodward, J., “can never affect the location of an older; it lies where it was put by •the surveyor, and whilst it may help to locate surrounding surveys that are younger, it (the older) is not to be changed, contracted, or enlarged by what may be <em>done in the location of them.” </em>This is the true doctrine of this case, and we might well leave the discussion here. But we may notice the practical workings of a different rule.</p>
    <p id="b268-8" data-blocks='[["BL_268.7",268,[297,2106,1174,300]],["BL_269.1",269,[200,378,1167,773]]]'>It would have the effect to change and enlarge surveys even after, as in this case, a patent had issued. It would introduce lines neither returned by the deputy surveyor, nor to be found in the patent. It would pass lands not sold by the commonwealth, and without her consent, and without paying to her the purchase-money. It would ignore the orderly mode of changing ■ a boundary by an order of resurvey, a consequence of which is, <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>payment for any increase of land, and an official return of 'the new survey. On the other hand, as the enlargement by this process is without the consent of the senior warrant-holder, it might give him quantities and qualities of land which he did not want, and worst of all, render uncertain the lines in his patent, and the description in deeds of conveyance that may have been made from it. Gores will exist wherever vacant land lies between the marked lines of approximating surveys; and we do not advance a step to prevent this by unhinging the settled law, which presumes the location to have been made as returned after twenty-one years, thus establishing boundaries. They will necessarily exist when lines on the ground exclude land between surveys. If evil arise from gores, it cannot be helped in such circumstances, and the commonwealth being the proprietor, has the sole right to appropriate them to parties willing to buy and pay for them. So the same rule should hold when, upon other principles, the location of land is equally well settled, or capable of being settled.</p>

This court has said that the acceptance of a patent ends all controversy about lines and quantities other than those described in it: Hagerty <em>v. </em>Mathers, 7 Casey 357; so it is here. True, a resurvey, ordered by the land office, might have enlarged the original survey, if obtained before intervening-rights, and even after a patent, by surrendering it, but that was not done, and the junior calls did not and could not change the boundaries of a senior survey. The consequence is, that the plaintiff must submit to be bounded by the lines of his tract as made and returned into the land office seventy years ago. We see no error in the case, and the judgment is</p>
