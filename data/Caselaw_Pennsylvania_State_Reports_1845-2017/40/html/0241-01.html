If it had been, it will, be conceded that the custom would have been the law of the contract, and both parties would have been bound by it. The one would not have been liable to suit, nor the other to the running of the statute until the customary credit had expired. It was not this, however', which the testimony was offered to prove, but the practice and usage of the firm in regard to giving credit. Now, as this was not good, as a custom, according to the definitions, it did not, <em>ex proprio </em>vigore, bind. Plow else could this practice, if it existed, have effect ? We answer, either by being expressly made parcel of the terms of the contract, or shown to have been known to the defendant and assented to. And this might be shown either by express proof, or by proving a practice of habit of dealing between plaintiffs and defendant, on such terms of such frequency, as to justify an inference that this transaction was on the accustomed terms. Evidence of this nature would have justified the reference of the question to the jury, from which to ascertain the terms of the contract and the credit given, but that received did not. It was error, therefore, to receive it, and consequently error to refer it to the jury as evidence from which they might extract a contract different in terms from that exhibited by the account.</p>
