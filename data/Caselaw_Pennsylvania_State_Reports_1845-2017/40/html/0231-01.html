On the 7th of January 1859, a citation was issued to them to settle an account. On the 24th of January 1859, they settled their <em>first </em>separate accounts, including nothing but personal estate actually received by them, exhibiting a balance on the account of Michael Gable of $6527.57, and on the account of Elias Tome of $6180.70.

    <p id="b235-6" data-blocks='[["BL_235.7",235,[202,479,1166,431]]]'>1. The accountants must pay under the direction of the court: Act of February 24th 1834, § 99; Act of April 13th 1840; Ludlam’s Estate, 1 Harris 188. The distribution was to be between brothers and sisters, or those claiming under them, of the deceased and of her deceased husband. These main truths were known to the auditor, wdiich was sufficient; nor was it necessary to report evidence when there was no controversy or room for it. The principal parties in interest were represented by counsel, between whom there was no dispute as to the right to participate in the distribution.</p>
    <p id="b235-7" data-blocks='[["BL_235.8",235,[203,909,1165,131]]]'>2. Therefore, the. accountants had no voice in the distribution, nor any right to detain the fund in their hands, while such questions are litigated.</p>

Whether the grandchildren of Mrs. Stahly are to stand in the place of their deceased parent or not, is of no consequence to the executors. But as the distribution is <em>per stirpes, </em>it is fair to suppose that the word children was used in the sense of <em>issue. </em>Her family do not raise this question, or wish to exclude any member of it from the distribution; nor are they willing to have it forced upon them by others.</p>

    <p id="b235-11" data-blocks='[["BL_235.12",235,[204,1598,1166,344]]]'>6. The payment of this money into court is a perfect and full discharge of'these accountants. As a distribution is for the purpose of ascertaining who are entitled to the fund, no one can surely be called upon to file a refunding bond until it is ascertained that he is entitled. The bond is not a condition precedent to the decree, but is in time when payment is demanded: Logan <em>v. </em>Richardson, 1 Barr 372; Bixler <em>v. </em>Blankenbiller, <a href="/watts/8/0064-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Watts 64" data-case-ids="1848404" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0064-01">8 Watts 64</a>; Act of February 24th 1834, § 2.</p>
    <p id="b235-12" data-blocks='[["BL_235.13",235,[202,1941,1168,294]]]'>8. The interest charge complained of is in accordance with the rules of right. There is no reason why the accountant should retain the interest which accrued on the balance due on his last account, without accounting for it at all, or for some future distribution. The practice of the court is to dispose of the whole matter at once, and distribute with the principal the interest which accrued on it.</p>
