Defendant also proved, that the tenants of Mitcheltree had cleared a portion of the land between the line running from the hickory corner and the Vanmetre line, using the land in dispute as his woodland; that Shirk had improved and cultivated about thirty-two rods south of the line running from the hickory corner, and west as far as John Gailey’s line, using the disputed land as his woodland; that S. S. Ewing, from the time he purchased in 1842, had possession, and used the cultivated and wood land, in connection with his other land, until he sold a portion of his farm in 1856, after which he erected a house on the part reserved and now in dispute, on which he lived until his death.</p>

S. Ewing. The learned judge cannot be blamed, therefore, for assuming such a line. Indeed, the whole testimony proceeds upon this as a fixed fact, and consequently there was no error in assuming it in the charge, and this disposes of the exception to the charge for so doing.</p>
    <p id="b500-6" data-blocks='[["BL_500.6",500,[321,734,1167,1199]]]'>But the existence of this line was the key to the solution of the whole difficulty in the case. It was the south boundary of the Ewing purchase, and to land south of it Ewing could only acquire title, as the learned judge said, by residence or clearing and cultivation. If he had gone upon it and cleared a field, and defined his boundaries, his occupancy thus would have drawn to it the possession of the woodland within the boundary, even as against the owner in the actual occupancy of other portions of the land. That was ruled by this court in Ament’s Ex’ors. <em>v. </em>Wolf, 9 Casey 331. But there must be a <em>pedis possessio </em>of the land. This possession being actual, adverse, notorious, hostile, and continued for twenty-one years, would give title by the Statute of Limitations. Here this sort of possession did not exist. It was simply the case of an adjoining owner, with actual boundaries and legal title, trespassing occasionally, and but seldom at that, until lately, on his neighbour’s woodland, by the occasional cutting a stick of timber thereon. His occasional declarations that he claimed it was of no avail, unaccompanied by actual occupancy in the manner stated, and as absolutely essential to the acquisition of title by the statute. Under circumstances even of this kind, an actual extension of the line from the Yanmetre fence west was an essential element to the ouster of the occupying owner of the tract. Without this, even an occupancy by clearing and cultivating for twenty-one years would only have availed to the extent of the enclosed territory. See Nepean <em>v. </em>Doe, 2 Smith’s Lead. Cas., 5th ed., p. 563, where the law is well stated. We see no error whatever in the law, as laid down by the learned judge in his charge.</p>

But we do not esteem it so. .The <em>praecipe </em>contains a sufficient description, and when that is the case, a general finding for the plaintiff, with nominal damages, is referable thereto.' It stands in lieu of a <em>narr., </em>and that and the plea of “not guilty” forms the issue between the parties. See 12th section of the Act of 21st March 1806. A general finding for the plaintiff is a finding of the issue for him. If it is sufficiently descriptive, therefore, the finding will be good, and as the judgment has reference to the issue, it will be sustainable by it.
