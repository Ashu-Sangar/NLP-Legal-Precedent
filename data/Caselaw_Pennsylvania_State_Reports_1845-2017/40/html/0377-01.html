The owners of the land were named, and they could show that the proposed road was unnecessary, or failing in that, could have their damages assessed, which was all they were entitled to under the law; nor were they compelled to appeal in order to prevent her participation in the damages, for the assessment was not an adjudication between them, and if it had been, it is no ground for reversing the action of the court below, where the damages had been assessed for the rightful owners: nor can <em>they </em>complain that their tenant was not named in the petition, for such omission was not a defect therein.</p>

That the risk of fire being communicated from locomotives to any building now erected or that may be erected hereafter on their land, could not be taken into consideration by the jury in estimating the damages sustained by the defendants arising from the construction of the plaintiff’s railroad over their land, because of the uncertain and contingent nature of such damages.

That the damages found by the jury ought to be sufficient to compensate the defendants for all the actual injury that will be done them respectively by the construction and use of the road, but they ought not to be extravagant or unreasonable; and in estimating the damages, they should take into consideration the advantages, if any, which may be derived by the defendants respectively as owners of the land passed through by the railroad, and make due allowance therefor; but might set off against this the' risk of fire to buildings from locomotives, and contingent disadvantages arising from the inconveniences that may be sustained in future, in ease of some possible use of the property, as the expense and inconvenience to which the owner of unopened mines may be put when he begins to work them, in consequence of the construction of the road over them, or in close proximity thereto, or the inconvenience and delay occasioned by having to cross said road in going from one part of defendant’s land to another.</p>

It is urged that the petition was so defective as to require the court to refuse to order a view, and to quash the entire proceeding even after the viewers had reported. The first alleged defect in the petition which is insisted on, is that Mary Peadon is named as a reputed joint owner, with the plaintiffs in error, of one of the tracts over which the proposed railroad was located, <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>when in truth she was not a joint owner. We are unable to perceive that this was any sufficient reason for refusing the view or quashing the petition, or that the plaintiffs in error could in any manner have been injured by the averment. The mistake did not appear on the face of the petition, and it was, therefore, no reason for refusing the view. Besides, the Act of Assembly does not in terms require that the names of the intervening landowners should be set out in the petition, though it is quite proper that they should be. Notice must be given if the owners are known and resident in the Commonwealth, yet it is supposed they may be unknown. But Boyd and wife were named as owners in the petition. This at most was all that they had a right to ask. It gave them an opportunity to show that the proposed road was not necessary, and failing in that, to have their damages assessed, and Mary Peadon’s name was stricken from the record, by leave of the court, after the report of viewers, and before the final assessment of damages. There is nothing in the argument that m consequence of a joint assessment by the viewers, the plaintiffs in error vrere compelled to appear, in order to prevent the participation of Mary Peadon. The assessment was not an adjudication between them, and if it had been, it would not justify us in reversing the action of the court now, when the damages have been assessed in favour of the rightful owners.</p>

It may have had some bearing upon the question whether the proposed road was necessary — nothing more — but that was a question for the <a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>viewers, and afterwards for the discretion of the court.

    <p id="b384-7" data-blocks='[["BL_384.7",384,[295,850,1160,203]]]'>The 6th and 7th assignments are disposed of by what we said in Horner &amp; Roberts’s Lateral Railroad, <a href="/wright/1/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Wright 333" data-case-ids="625773" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0340-01">1 Wright 333</a>, and in Brown <em>v. </em>Peterson, decided at this term. The court was right in refusing to submit to the jury the necessity of the proposed road.</p>
    <p id="b384-8" data-blocks='[["BL_384.8",384,[294,1064,1161,85]]]'>The 8th assignment is shown to be without merit, by what we have said respecting the 4th and 5th.</p>
    <p id="b384-9" data-blocks='[["BL_384.9",384,[295,1150,1161,126]]]'>The 9th, 10th, and 11th have not been pressed in the argument, and they are not sustained. The testimony offered and rejected was wholly irrelevant to the issues before the jury.</p>
    <p id="b384-10" data-blocks='[["BL_384.10",384,[297,1277,1159,127]]]'>The 12th and 13th are also not sustained. The charge of the court was in entire accordance with the doctrine of Searle <em>v. </em>The Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad Company, 9 Casey 57.</p>
    <p id="b384-11" data-blocks='[["BL_384.11",384,[295,1404,1161,126]]]'>No attempt has been made to vindicate the remaining assignment of error, and none could be with success. The judgment is, therefore, to be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b384-12" data-blocks='[["BL_384.12",384,[296,1534,1162,471]]]'>We deem it proper to remark, though not required to do so by any of the assignments of error, that before an appeal from the report of viewers of a proposed lateral railroad, be sent to an appellate jury for trial, the court should approve or disapprove the finding of the viewers respecting its necessity. There is nothing to be tried, if the court_does not concur in opinion with the viewers. In the present case, sending the issues to a jury, and entering judgment upon their verdict, was perhaps in effect a decision that in the opinion of the court the road was necessary, but we think it better that the action of the court upon that subject should directly appear.</p>
    <p id="b384-13" data-blocks='[["BL_384.13",384,[1068,2004,344,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
