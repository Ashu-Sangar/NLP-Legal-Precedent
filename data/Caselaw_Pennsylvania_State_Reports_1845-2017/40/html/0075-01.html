Sheriff Snively received bail for the hand-money, and took judgment-bonds from the purchaser for the two annual payments which were filed as liens against the lands sold. This was done in the fall of 1850. The last note was due 30th November 1852, and the auditor’s report was confirmed February 17th 1851. No word of complaint from any quarter is heard until the 1st of November 1859, when these plaintiffs brought suit. Surely the jury had a right to suppose that those very plaintiffs, as “parties concerned,” had been entirely satisfied with the nature and kind of security taken by the sheriff in lieu of the consideration-money. This view is strengthened by the other .evidence in the case. In February, the judgments given for the payments of 1851 and 1852 were marked upon the record for the use of the plaintiffs in this action. They were, however, really the property of plaintiffs as soon as taken. The sheriff was a mere trustee, and although the notes <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>wore given to A. J.' Snively, sheriff, his heirs or assigns, they belonged to the plaintiffs. After the 14th of February 1859, the plaintiffs issued executions upon those very judgments, and sold property of defendant John King. When the whole of the lands of John King had been sold, and the money made thereon had been brought into court for distribution, these very parties claimed and received a part of the money. The judgment for hand-money was satisfied by the sale, and the money appropriated thereto was raised from a sale of the very lands, for the proceeds-of which these parties are now pursuing the sheriff. The plaintiffs in this action were the sisters of John King, the purchaser. Sheriff Snively went out of office in November 1851. He had never delivered his deed to John King for the lands sold. The plaintiffs, however, saw fit to indulge their brother for a period of nearly ten years, and now seek to hold the sheriff responsible. It is admitted that the notes taken for the purchase-money were abundantly secure until they were permitted to lose their liens. This did not happen until 1856, nearly five years after Mr. Snively was out of office. If any liability was incurred by him it did not happen until this latter period; and, as this is an action upon his official recognisance, there can be no recovery. But' under any view of the case which can be taken, the court was in error in taking the case from the jury. The questions of fact involved in the case were for the finding of the jury, and not for the decision of the court. The court not only decided all the law of the case, but also proceeded to find the facts and make the verdict for the jury. This was clearly error: McIldowney <em>v. </em>Williams, 4 Casey 492; Dougherty <em>v. </em>Stephenson, 8 Harris 210; Cole <em>v. </em>Bolard, 10 Id. 431.</p>

These notes and judgments were payable to Andrew J. Snively, his heirs and assigns, a portion being for the first payment, which it was his business to have in cash, and pay over under the decree of distribution; for there was due to some of these plaintiffs a full share of the hand-money from John and Thomas King, which was not paid accord<a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>ing to that decree, the sheriff having charge of the whole matter.</p>

If he desired or intended to do this, why was it not done years before ? To do it then was an acknowledgment .that he had not previously done his duty. It was his business then, if he wished *to get rid of the responsibility of holding the securities payable to himself, to go to the parties, and, after paying over their share of the hand-money, which he should have had in his hands, assign them their several portions of the judgments to fall due. But having accepted the trust, as one of the duties belonging to his office, and holding the money and securities as such trustee, nothing short of a compliance with the decree of distribution will release his liability. This view of the case answers both first and second points.</p>

There is a limitation of five years to an action against the sureties in the official bond of a sheriff, but this is an action against the sheriff only on his recognisance. At the time this suit was brought there was no limit short at least of twenty-one years on the recognisance of a sheriff. The Act of 3d April 1860 limits the lien of the recognisance to ten years, but expressly provides that this expiration of lien shall not be construed to release the sheriff, his administrators or executors, from liability to answer any claims which may be established against him occasioned by official delinquency. A sheriff is not, therefore, entitled to plead the statute against the payment of funds in his hands, being an officer of the court and a trustee.</p>

In taking the judgment-notes for the deferred payments, the sheriff’s name was used merely that there might be a formal contract for the money. In such judicial obligations, taken as part of the proceedings in a cause, it is not necessarily implied that the obligee is bound to see to their enforcement, for they are often taken in the name of the Commonwealth, and formerly very often in the name of the president judge, and they are really the property of the parties, or of some of them, and usually it is their business to attend <em>to </em>them.</p>
