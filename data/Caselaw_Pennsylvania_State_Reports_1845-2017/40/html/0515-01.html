In February 1857, he abandoned the seminary, sold to his mother, in satisfaction of her claim, this piano, with' some other articles of household furniture, and removed with his wife to Canons-burg, where he commenced business as a dentist. Mrs. McCreary, the plaintiff, moved to Sewickly, taking with her the goods she had there purchased from her son, where she remained until June 1858.

The plaintiff thereupon instructed the sheriff to relinquish all except the piano, which was subsequently sold for $170.

Both parties claimed through him, and thus affirmed his title. He was not called, therefore, to support his title ; but to prove a sale of the property, a fact necessary to the plaintiff, and which the defendants denied. They did not rely on the absence of title in the witness, but only that his transfer to the plaintiff was fraudulent either in law or fact. If it were either, the sale surely did not imply a guarantee on his part that such a transaction should be effectual to vest title in his participant in the fraud. The defendants alleged that it was a collusive transaction to defraud creditors, and in that aspect they could not apply a doctrine which a vendee might do if the title failed by reason of a fraud in the sale. But the question is settled by the case of Miller <em>v. </em>Fitch, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0366-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 366" data-case-ids="481842" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0366-01">7 W. &amp; S. 366</a>, in which it is distinctly ruled in a case like the present, and where the objection was the same, that the vendee- was a competent witness.</p>

It is true that he further testifies that after a few weeks, not succeeding as he expected, he and family returned to this county. After this his mother became again a resident with him, and the piano was kept at his house, and used by his wife, with the permission of his mother. From these facts, a court could not pronounce the transaction a fraud in law. There was in appearance, at least, a substantial delivery and transfer of the possession, and so retained exclusively for four or five weeks. This length of time was thought to be sufficient, in Brady <em>v. </em>Howes, 6 Harris 113, when there was nothing to show it to have been a delivery merely proforma, to prevent the operation of the doctrine in cases of fraud in law from applying, to turn it into a question of fact as to whether the transaction was collusive or not; and see Smith’s Leading Cases, 5th Am. ed., p. 73.
