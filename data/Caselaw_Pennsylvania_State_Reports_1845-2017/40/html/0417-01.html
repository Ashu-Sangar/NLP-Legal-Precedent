    <p class="summary" id="b417-15" data-blocks='[["BL_417.14",417,[173,1792,1163,373]]]'>The oxen in controversy were purchased by the plaintiff from Isaiah Cobb, at a place called Beach Bottom, about nine miles from Ridgeway, and paid for by a credit for their value on a promissory note which plaintiff held against said Cobb. They were then delivered to plaintiff, who drove them to Ridgeway, where he remained with them over night. As he was leaving the next morning for his home, in the state of New York, the oxen were levied on by the defendant, as the property of John Cobb.</p>

B. Cobb, for the sale of certain personal property therein mentioned, amounting to &lt;§5772.84, and for the interest which John Cobb had in a certain <a id="p418" href="#p418" data-label="418" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*418</a>made by Mm with Blake, Dreeden, Garnett, and Wilcox, for manufacturing lumber at the Beach Bottom Mill in Elk county. This was followed by evidence tending to show that at the time John Cobb sold the personal property and interest in the contract to I. &amp; T. B. Cobb, he was insolvent, and the allegation of the defendant was that the sale was intended to delay, hinder, and defraud creditors, and was therefore void, under the statute of 13 Elizabeth. One yoke of the oxen in controversy was included in the sale of June 5th 1858, above mentioned. The other was bought afterwards by Isaiah Cobb, from Zina Yanorman, and paid for with a pair of horses, which were included in the agreement of June 5th 1858.</p>

If they should find it was not, then their verdict should be in favour of plaintiff for the value of the property of which he had been deprived by defendant, and interest. If they should find that the sale was fraudulent, their verdict should be for the defendant. That defendant would not be a trespasser, if the jury should find that the sale to I. &amp; T. B.

The present case, as presented by the plaintiff in error’s paper-book, appears to come within this category, and the error of the court was in instructing the jury, upon only one branch of the proposition, that if the sale by the alleged fraudulent vendor to the <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>alleged fraudulent vendee was fraudulent, then their verdict should be for the defendant, entirely ignoring the question, whether the plaintiff purchased with a knowledge of the fraud or not. Upon that point, the court should have instructed the jury upon the law as we have stated it, and submitted the facts to them under such ruling, for their decision.
