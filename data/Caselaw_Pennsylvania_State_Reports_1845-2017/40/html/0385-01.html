The fees charged by the master being excepted to, the court, after argument, confirmed the report, and ordered them to be paid on or before a given time by the complainant, who appealed from that decree: <em>Held, </em>that the court below were the best judges of the amount due the master under the circumstances, and that where it appeared that the master had much labour and trouble in investigating the affairs of the parties, the order of the court below would not be interfered with, even if it were such a final decree as is the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court.</p>

His first notice was issued to the parties on May 30th 1860, and the first meeting held on the 12th of June following. Between that time and the date of the supplementary order several meetings were held, and various questions heard and decided by the master. In August an application was made by defendant’s solicitor to revoke the appointment of the master, which was refused by the court, and the master authorized to take testimony and return it to court, with his opinion thereon. Under these orders a large amount of labour was performed by the master until June 29th 1861, when the suit was settled, withdrawn, and discontinued.</p>

This, of course, could not be done without the express or implied leave of the court, and the payment of the costs of the master. On the 2d July the master made his report, stating this fact and the amount of his fees, and on the same day this report was filed. On the 16th August exceptions to the fees as master were filed by both plaintiff and defendant, and on the 17th August the report of the master was confirmed, and the complainant ordered to pay the fees of the master; and on the 81st August it was ordered and decreed that the complainant pay to the master his fees, on or before the 16th September, and from this decree the complainant appealed.</p>
