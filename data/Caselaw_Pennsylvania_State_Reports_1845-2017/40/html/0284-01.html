In 1855 another supervisor was appointed by the town council of the borough, who, under the same order, opened the road to its full length and breadth, and was paid by the borough for his work and expense in so doing. Two years after, the “street commissioner” of the borough, under resolution of the town council, got another order from the clerk of the quarter sessions, in which the draft was changed, and “ street commissioner” inserted for “ supervisor,” under which he changed the location of the road as opened in 1855, placing it farther upon the land of an adjoining lot owner, who brought an action of trespass against the “ street commissioner” for tearing down his fence, &amp;c., in altering the road. <em>Held,</em>

As he was threatened with a suit in case he proceeded to execute the order, Mr. Ammon took a bond of indemnity from certain persons interested in the opening of the road, and opened it according to the order of the court, except that he made an offset in the road on the side owned by Mr. Malcom. Previous to this, to wit, December 29th 1854, a petition was presented to the court, setting forth that the order to open had not been exécuted farther than Race street (which,was the boundary of the land owned by the University, or by Mr. Malcom), and praying for a view to <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>vacate the remainder of the road south. A jury was appointed, who reported to May Sessions 1855. A review was granted at September Sessions 1855, and the contest kept up by re-reviews and exceptions until February 21st 1857, when the Quarter Sessions so disposed of the reports and the exceptions as to leave the road as originally laid out in 1850.</p>

In doing so he set in the fence of Mr. Malcom at one end of his lot, the other corner being at or near its proper place, which was the trespass for which suit was brought.</p>

It was done by the supervisor, and not disputed by any other officer or person until near two years afterwards. It is now insisted that the street commissioner was the proper officer to do it, and not the supervisor, or at least that he should fix its lines.</p>

No ordinance assigns this duty to any one officer, and we cannot supply this defect. If the superiors of an officer do not dispute his acts at or about the time of their performance, we must treat them as valid. The name of the office supervisor helps us in this. Without a special definition of it, we must receive it according to its general definition., or common usage, and then we treat the supervisor as the proper authority to open roads under the order of the court. This road having been opened by him, we presume-that he was the proper officer to do it, unless the contrary be shown, and this throws all the burden of proof on the defendant below.</p>
