Mrs. Miller, being in possession from the time the lot was purchased from Massey, had no rights which required “ enforcing.” She might have had a bill to compel the conveyance of the legal title, but could not have brought ejectment. The 6th section was intended for cases where no possession was taken by the <em>cestui que trust. </em>The Act has no implied retroactive operation: Mullock <em>v. </em>Souder, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20198" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 198">9 W. &amp; S. 198</a>; Martindale <em>v. </em>Warner, 2 Harris 471.

We do not think there was any error in admitting in evidence on the part of the defendant the last will of Harriet Summers. It was part of the defendant’s title, and necessary also to raise a legal question which, because it was not decided in the court below, we shall not consider here, to wit, how far the plaintiff was estopped from setting up his present claim of title by the fact that he was an accepting legatee under his aunt’s will.</p>

If the plaintiff be subject to this section, he has no reason to complain of the construction and application which the court made of it. But is he subject to it? Is it applicable to him ? He was a minor when his estate vested — a minor when the Act of 1856 was passed, and' he did not attain to his majority until April 1858 — a year only before he brought suit. The Act óf 1856 has no saving clause' for minors, and others under legal disabilities, but the 3d section of the Act of 26th March 1785, Purd. 653, which limits a right of entry into lands to twenty-one years next after the right or title “first descended or accrued,” has in the proviso a saving clause in behalf of minors, <em>femes </em>covert, and others under legal disabilities, and declares that notwithstanding the expiration of the allotted limitation, they may make entry or bring suit within “ten years next after attaining full age, discoverture,” &amp;e.</p>

And so would her son, succeeding on her death to her rights, be entitled to his action, not within ten years after his majority, according to the Act of 1785, but within thirty years from the time the right accrued to his mother. In some circumstances this might be a total denial of action to a son when he came of age — in the circumstances of this case it was an extension of remedy much beyond what the Act of 1785 allowed him.</p>

And, because of the express modification, we assume there was no intention to repeal the prior statute. There is no word in the Act of 1856 which implies an intention to repeal the proviso of the Limitation Law of 17 85. If the first section had been omitted altogether, it is very doubtful whether we could have regarded the 6th section as a repeal of that proviso ; but with the first section before us, it is impossible to imply a repeal of the proviso of 1785, except as modification and substitution were repeal. Taking the limitation, therefore, as it stands modified by the legislation of 1856, it is apparent that the plaintiff is within it. His suit was brought within thirty years after his mother’s right of action accrued. It is not material that it was brought within ten years after his own disability ceased. It was brought in good time. It is not barred by the limitation of the 6th section, because that limitation is inapplicable to persons under legal disabilities. Another rule is provided for such persons, and the plaintiff brings himself within it. Hence it follows that the court erred in applying the bar of the 6th section.</p>

For that statute was intended to discourage all titles resting in parol, and to compel people to create written evidence of their rights in land. The 5th section was most unadvisedly repealed by a subsequent legislature, but the 4th and the 6 th sections were designed to reduce all <em>trusts </em>to writing, or to furnish record evidence of them by putting parties to their action within a reasonable period. But Mrs. Miller having died before the Act of 1856, it became a rule of law to her successors in title. It was as much the duty of her heir to create written evidence of the trust as it would have been her duty had she still lived; and this without regard to. the actual possession. The statute meant to superadd to the possession written evidence of the right of possession. But this duty thus devolved on the heir, was to be discharged under the limitations and provisions of prior acts, as modified by the legislation of 1856. He has brought his suit in discharge of that duty, and for the reasons before stated, we think it was brought in time.</p>
