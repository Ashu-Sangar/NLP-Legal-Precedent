In 1849 an account of the trust was filed and confirmed in the Court of Common Pleas, showing a balance in favour of the committee. After the death of both, suit was brought in 1858 by A.’s administratrix, to recover the balance due upon the single bill, against B.’s executor, who set off in defence the balance due his testator in the account as settled, to which plaintiff replied that it was barred by the Statute of Limitations.</p>

Herein it acts as a Court of Chancery, exercising a jurisdiction which in England is committed to Chancery, and exercising it in chancery forms of procedure.
