His notice of a road-tax sale of his own grain for Piper’s tax was found, upon scrutiny, to be wholly fictitious, but behind it was the concealed fact that the grains were his as assignee of Piper’s lessee. Admit that he had a kind of possession of the grain-fields, it was not such a possession as to require from bidders a closer reconnoissance of his right to the grains beyond the title he specifically asserted — the road-tax title. This bidders could ascertain was a nullity, and under the notice given, they •were not bound to make further inquiry. He led them to that, and that only.</p>

And the further notice that the plaintiff had bought the crop on a sale of it for road taxes was not misleading; for if growing crops may be sold for taxes, those even of a tenant may be sold for the taxes on the land occupied by him, and any one may buy them in and get a good title. Such a notice does not at all divert the attention of a purchaser, from the fact that there, is a crop in the ground that may belong to a tenant or his vendee. We perceive no error in the case.</p>
