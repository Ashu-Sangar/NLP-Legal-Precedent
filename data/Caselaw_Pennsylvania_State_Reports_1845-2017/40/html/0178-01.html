Nagle then called upon the plaintiffs to indemnify him, whereupon they, with John Manderbach and Rudolph Huzzard, of Berks, and George W. Mortimer, of Schuylkill county, executed and delivered to him a joint and several bond in the sum of $1000, conditioned to indemnify him against all suits, actions, costs, charges, and damages, by reason of selling the goods and chattels of any persons whatsoever, as, or supposing them to be the goods and chattels of the defendant in the writs.

In the record offered in evidence, it appears that the case was settled, and that damages claimed by the plaintiff, against "William Zerr, were included. Huzzard was not connected with William Zerr. He had no privity with him. He was not answerable in any way for damages on his account. This then was a case between other parties, to whom Huzzard was alien, and the record was not <em>evidence; nor </em>was the subject-matter of the suit the same. Huzzard had no right or opportunity to make defence, or control the proceedings, or adduce testimony, or cross-examine witnesses adduced on the other side. Not having these rights, or an opportunity to exercise these, he was a 'stranger to the case: 1 Greenl. Ev., § 523.</p>

Nagle held Huzzard’s bond of indemnity, in relation to the execution of Potteiger and Rice. When sued he should have given them notice. He should have made an honest and full defence — the confession of judgment by him would not have been evidence in his favour. It would be evidence made by himself. A settlement made by him would not be evidence for him for the same reason. If he permitted others to settle, it would fall within the same principle. Huzzard was not represented by any one. If Nagle intended to look to Huzzard, he should have given him notice. He knew of the suit, Huzzard did not. He lived in the county, and Huzzard did not. It was, therefore, his duty to defend the suit in good faith, or have given him notice, so that he might have made defence. It will not do for him to say, that Potteiger and Rice had notice, and that they made the settlement. It might answer as to Potteiger and Rice, but as to no other. Let him look to them, and not to Huzzard. <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>They treated him as if he had no right in controversy.
