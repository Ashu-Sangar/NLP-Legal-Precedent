Under the Act 21st April 1858, providing for the sale of the state canals, the Wyoming Canal Company, as “the assigns” of the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, were bound to keep in repair a private bridge crossing the North Branch Canal, as had been done by the commonwealth, who built the bridge for the owner of the farm when the canal was made; subsequently, the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad Company, duly authorized by law, built their road on the banks of the canal whore the bridge crossed, and so altered it in height and length as to increase the cost of keeping it in repair; the bridge becoming unsafe, the canal company refused to repair, whereupon suit was brought by the owner of the farm. <em>Held, </em>that the canal company was not relieved from its obligation to keep the bridge in repair, by any acts of the railroad company in the location or construction of their road, and that it was error in the court below to instruct the jury, that the railroad company had by their acts released the canal company from any obligations to repair the bi’idge.</p>

This bridge, with its embankments, was kept in repair by the commonwealth until the governor, under the provisions of the “ Act for the sale of the state canals,” passed 21st of April 1858, assigned and transferred the canal to the Sunbury <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>and Erie Railroad Company. In the 5th section of this act it is enacted that “the Snnbnry and Erie Railroad Company, or their assigns, immediately after taking possession of the said canals, shall be bound to keep up the same, including public and private bridges crossing the said canals, as heretofore done by the canal commissioners, <em>in as good repair and operating condition as they now are.” </em>The Wyoming Canal Company subsequently became the owner of that part of the canal which passes through the plaintiff’s farm, and took possession of the same. By an Act of Assembly passed 5th April 1852 and a supplement thereto passed 3d March 1853, the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad Company was incorporated “with all the powers and subject to all provisions and restrictions prescribed by an act, entitled an Act regulating Railroad Companies, approved the nineteenth day of February, one thousand eight hundred and forty-nine,” and were authorized to build and construct a railroad from Scranton, in Luzerne county, to connect with the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company or the Susquehanna Railroad Company, at the-town of Sunbury or northward thereof, at any point in the counties of Northumberland and Lycoming. By another supplement, passed 5th April 1855, the railroad company was authorized, “with the assent and under the direction of the supervisor of the North Branch Canal, to locate their road at certain points thereof upon the berme bank of said canal,” &amp;c. The railroad company constructed their road from Scranton to connect with the Sunbury and Erie Railroad at the town of Northumberland, but it was after the commonwealth had parted with her canals and the defendant became the owner of the part now in their possession, that the railroad company located and built their road through the plaintiff’s land upon the berme bank of the canal, and in doing so tore down the superstructure of the canal bridge, took away the embankment and the wing walls of the abutment on the north side, converted it into a pier, and added seven and a half feet to its height — raised the abutment on the south side four and a quarter feet higher — increased the width of the base of the embankment and raised it to correspond with the increased height of the abutment, thereby making the embankment steeper and three feet narrower on the top. They then reconstructed the superstructure over the canal with the old material at this increased elevation, and with other materials, and extended the bridge forty-nine feet over the railroad by two trestles to a new embankment made by them on the north side. The railroad company are required, by the 12th section of the Act of 19th February 1849, “for the accommodation of all persons owning or possessing land through which the said railroad may pass, to make or cause to be made a good and sufficient causeway or causeways, whenever the same may be necessary to <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>enable the occupant or occupants of the said land to cross or pass over the same, with wagons, carts, and implements of husbandry, as occasion may require, and the said causeway or causeways, when so made,” to “maintain and keep in good repair.” The alteration, extension, and elevation of the bridge was rendered necessary by the railroad company locating their road as above stated.</p>

L. 417. For a failure to repair the farm bridge on plaintiff’s land, this suit, after notice to repair it, was brought, and it was agreed on the trial below that repairs to the extent of $10 were required at the time, and that this was the amount of the damages to be assessed, if plaintiff was entitled to recover.

If the railroad company have injured the canal company in regard to it or increased their responsibility and expenses in keeping it in repair, the law must be very lame if it will not require them to make compensation, as it would be bound to do to any other proprietor whose property might be taken or injured by it. We have not that company before us, however; but we can see that it is possible for it to be answerable also to the plaintiff under its charter; but if it were this would not destroy the plaintiff’s right to hold the canal company to its obligation. A man may have several parties bound to the performance of duties and obligations to him, and there being-several so bound does not relieve either until satisfaction from some one is made. The assignments of error all relate to the same thing and are sustained. It was an error to charge that the canal company was not liable to repair the bridge in question, and the judgment must be reversed; but as the amount of the damages was agreed upon, if the plaintiff was entitled to recover, we will enter judgment now for that sum instead of putting the parties to a new trial.</p>
