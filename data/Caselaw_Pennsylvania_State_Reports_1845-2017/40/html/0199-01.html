He had known Sally for thirty years — “ she came into my house in summer of 1858 — she was jumping round and speaking very hard of Bricker. I never considered her crazy, but considered her very malicious when she got raised and on her high horse and took running spells — often came to our house, would dance round like a top, and then run out without speaking three words —at other times she would sit down and cry.”</p>
    <p id="b205-6" data-blocks='[["BL_205.6",205,[168,902,1172,1501]]]'>This witness, and several others on the part of the defendant, detailed facts and expressed opinions touching Sarah’s mental competency without objection, but when the plaintiff proposed in cross-examination to ask some of the witnesses, “From your observation and knowledge of Sarah Moore, of which you have testified, was the character of her mind such as that she had not an accurate knowledge of facts ? or would she fancy the existence of facts which did not exist?” — it was strenuously objected to on the part of the defence, and the admission of the answer is complained of as error. It strikes us as evidence of the same nature of much of that which the defendant had previously given. Why was it not competent for the plaintiff, as well as the defendant, to draw out from the witnesses an opinion of competency founded on their knowledge and detail of facts ? It is said we ruled, in Lecky Blosser, 12 Harris 404, that witnesses could not give their opinions that parties were in love with each other, and engaged to be married, but that the facts were to be described for the jury to judge of. Very well. That does not touch this case, for here the question was one of skill and science. What is mental competency to make a contract or will, or to deliver truthful testimony, is a question which must for ever depend, very greatly, upon the opinions of those who have had opportunities for observing the conduct of the party and the developments of the intellectual faculties. Facts and circumstances are to be sworn to as the groundwork of the opinions offered, and as affording tests of the soundness of the opinions; but opinions, the results of observed facts, are never excluded in such cases. It is the highest and most direct evidence the nature of the question can afford. Where the question is, as it was in Lecky <em>v. </em>Blosser, a question of contract between parties confessedly competent, the opinions of witnesses are properly excluded, for a contract is capable of affording other proofs. And besides, the inquiry had regard there to the state of the moral affections, rather than of the intellect — a point on which opinions are little trustworthy.</p>

      <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>The answer of the Rev. Joshua Evans, to the effect that Sarah told him the same story, as early as July or August 1857, which she swore here, was scarcely within the rule which allows what a witness swore on a former trial to be given in support of his present testimony: 10 S. &amp; R. 322. But still it tended not only to corroborate her (and she stood in great need of corroboration), but also to help the jury to a right estimate of her intellectual faculties. To reword a narrative without substantial variation, is indicative of memory, the most valuable of all the powers of the mind. Under the peculiar circumstances of the case, we are not disposed to sustain the exception to this piece of evidence.</p>
