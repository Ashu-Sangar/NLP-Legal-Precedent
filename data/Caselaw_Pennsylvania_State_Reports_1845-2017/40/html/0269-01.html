The Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company were to retain a specified portion of the earnings made by them upon the road of the Philadelphia <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>and Sunbury Railroad Company, and the balance was to be disposed of according to the provisions of the 6th section of the agreement, which were as follows, viz.: “ That the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company shall and will pay the remaining earnings of the local trade and through trade, when received by them in cash, and not required to be retained and applied by the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, for the purposes herein provided; and the same are hereby, by the said Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad Company, assigned, transferred, appropriated, and shall be applied and paid in the manner following, viz.: [but without any liability in the said Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, to see to the application of said sums of money, or any of them], the said Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company shall first pay thereout, unto Stephen Bittenbender, the sum of $7000, being the amount of indebtedness of the said Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad Company, to him for repairs of cars, with lawful interest thereon until paid; and after payment thereof, shall next pay to Alfred R. Fiske the sum of $1800, being the amount of indebtedness of the said Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad Company to him for services as superintendent, with lawful interest till paid; and after payment thereof, shall pay over and deliver all other sums which would, during the continuance of the contract, become due a,nd payable to the said Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad Company, into the hands of Edward S. Wheeler,” to be applied to the payment of the interest accruing on the mortgage bonds of the said company, in the order of the dates of the mortgages. On the 81st of March 1857, the Sunbury a.nd Erie Railroad Company applied to Bittenbender to make an arrangement with him for repairing their cars and engines. Bittenbender refused to make any arrangement for this purpose until his claim against the Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad Company, for similar services, was settled. Mr. Merrick, the President of the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, then informed him of the provisions of the 6th section of the agreement between the twm companies, and promised him that his claim should be paid out of the portion due or accruing to the Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad Company as soon as sufficient for that purpose should be earned. Bittenbender then assented to the arrangement, said he was perfectly satisfied, and agreed to do the repairs for the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, and did do them w’hile that company ran the road. After the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company had run the road for some time, Bittenbender believing that they had earned sufficient to pay him, sent his attorney to Philadelphia to receive payment, and the president of the company, after consulting the counsel of the company, and examining the agreement again, promised to pay Mr. Bittenbender, <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>and said he would send his brother to make an arrangement with Mr. Bittenbender, and pay him with the notes of the company. An attachment-execution was subsequently issued out of the District Court of Philadelphia by Robert Lucas, a judgment-creditor of the Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad Company, and served on the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, who then refused to pay Bittenbender, and this action was instituted. After the service of the writ in this case sundry other attachment-executions were served on the defendant. Before suit brought, the defendants had earned and received in cash more than sufficient to pay the plaintiff’s claim and the amount of the execution of Lucas, and at the trial had earned more than enough to j&gt;ay the plaintiff’s claim, and all of the attachment-executions.</p>

The plaintiff’s debt was against the Philadelphia and Sunbury Railroad Company, his action against the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company.

But a man cannot grant all.the wool that shall grow upon his sheep that he shall buy hereafter, for there he hath it neither actually nor potentially.

The court would supply a competent trustee. The question raised in the case, however, has not reference to the capacity of the assignee, but to the fact of an assignment. For the reasons before given, we think an assignment, though not intended, was in fact made. And made not directly to the creditors, as argued, but to the Sunbury and Erie Company, in trust for the creditors. Though the trust is not very distinctly defined, and all liability for mis<a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>application of moneys is released to the assignee, yet it is too apparent to admit of a doubt that the transfer of the property was by one company to the other in trust, for the benefit of creditors. At no time could Bittenbender have claimed possession of the road under the assignment. <em>He </em>was not to earn ne.t profits by use of it, but the Sunbury arid Erie was to have the exclusive possession of the road and to earn the profits. And these when received “by them in cash, and not required to .be retained and applied for the purposes herein provided for, shall be applied and paid in manner following,” &amp;c.</p>
    <p id="b277-5" data-blocks='[["BL_277.6",277,[239,832,1167,216]]]'>This was a grant, not to Bittenbender and Fiske, but- to the Sunbury and Erie Company, for their use and benefit. It was -an express trust; we can make nothing else of it. But the preferences are void, because forbidden by statute.. For all purposes except the preferences the assignment is sustainable.</p>
    <p id="b277-6" data-blocks='[["BL_277.7",277,[234,1047,1171,474]]]'>But here comes in another argument, that- the preference of Bittenbender was lawful, because his bill was for repairs of the rolling stock, without which the road could not be. kept. up. Among execution creditors we do not allow one or more to seize and sell those appurtenances of improvement companies, without which they cannot accomplish the end of their being, .but we put the creditors to process of sequestration by which the corporate property may be continued in productive use for the benefit of all creditors alike. And we do essentially the same thing here ■when we hold this an assignment for creditors, and cut out its preferences.</p>
    <p id="b277-7" data-blocks='[["BL_277.8",277,[236,1520,1167,385]]]'>The fact that Bittenbender’s labor was expended on cars, entitled him to no preference in the assignment. It is hard to deny 'him a preference for so meritorious a claim, and it is with regret that we lay down the law against him. But we have to declare the legal effect of his position. He comes in under the assignment. The promise he lays in his declaration, was a promise founded upon the assignment. The law forbids preferences in such assignments. The plaintiff’s action is to enforce one of these preferences.</p>
    <p id="b277-8" data-blocks='[["BL_277.9",277,[285,1906,911,40]]]'>To sustain this action would be to repeal a statute.</p>
    <p id="b277-9" data-blocks='[["BL_277.10",277,[895,1947,461,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b277-10" data-blocks='[["BL_277.11",277,[285,2033,370,42]]]'>Strong, J., dissents.</p>
