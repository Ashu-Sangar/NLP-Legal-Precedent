On the trial, the plaintiff attempted to prove that the logs had been cut on a tract of land belonging to him, and of which he had possession. To meet the proof thus offered, the defendant then proposed and was permitted to give evidence tending to show that the timber was not cut on the land of the plaintiff, but on land at the-time belonging to and in possession of his, the defendant’s, vendors. The admission of this evidence is the matter complained of in the first assignment of error, and the reason alleged for the complaint is, that it was allowing the title to land to be tried in a transitory action. It is easy to see, however, that the objection is based upon an entire misconception. While it is true that, in actions of replevin or trover, the title to real property cannot be directly tried and adjudicated upon, it is equally true that it may be incidentally brought in question, and may therefore be admitted in evidence. So it has often been held, and the mischief would be intolerable were it not so. In the case now before <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>us, the evidence was not received for the purpose of trying the title to any tract of land. It was material to the defence to show that the logs replevied had not been taken from land in the possession of the plaintiff; and this was directly proved by the evidence received by the court. In the absence of any actual adverse possession of timber lands, such as these were from which the logs were taken, the law casts possession upon the owner, Proof of title in the defendant’s vendor, therefore, was also proof of at least constructive possession in him, and consequently was fatal to the plaintiff’s action. That it was legitimate, is shown by the language of Mr. Justice Rogers, in Elliott <em>v. </em>Powell, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%20455" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="10 Watts 455">10 Watts 455</a>, and Chief Justice Gibson, in Wright <em>v. </em>Guier, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20177" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="9 Watts 177">9 Watts 177</a>.

It is obvious that the evidence admitted, would not have disproved the possession of his heirs, or tended to maintain the plaintiff’s action. But it is urged that it would have tended to reduce the damages to which the defendant, if successful, was entitled. By the writ of replevin, the logs were taken from the defendant and delivered to the plaintiff, in 1854, nearly seven years before the ease was tried. Both parties agreed that if the jury found for the defendant, they might find the value of the timber. Under these circumstances, we do not perceive that the proposed evidence should have affected the question of damages. We think, therefore, there was no error in rejecting it.</p>

The only avowed purpose for which the offer was made, was to show boundary, not that of the plaintiff’s land, of course, but that of the John Baird tract. Doubtless, it would have been competent to give any evidence tending to establish that the boundary of that tract did not include the land upon which the logs were cut, for the constructive possession which the title drew after it could not extend beyond the boundary, but the indescriptive warrant and survey under it, made of the plaintiff’s land, were no evidence of the boundary of the John Baird tract, for the survey was made long after that tract had <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>been located.
