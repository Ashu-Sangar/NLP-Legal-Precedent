Defendants claimed, first, that the beach of the river (including the <em>locus in quo), </em>if Dr. Bedford ever had any title <em>to it, </em>had been dedicated by him to public use, to be used as a street; and that plaintiff’s ancestor took subject to the public easement.

The first purchasers have their lots designated only by numbers, and the bank on the Delaware is left open east of the front street, which it is known was intended as a top-common from end to end, and yet this plan is the foundation of a great and populous city, and has always been received in evidence as well as the list of first purchasers, which contains only the name of each purchaser, and the number of his lot.</p>

The plan is a title paper of the borough, and of every lot-holder, and the municipal authorities took the only course they could devise to establish its authenticity, by perpetuating the testimony of the person who drew the plan, and who is now dead. Fifty years have elapsed, and where is another living witness to be found ?</p>
    <p id="b513-7" data-blocks='[["BL_513.7",513,[179,954,1167,558]]]'>The present suit arose under a claim for damages by the defendant in error, under the Act establishing a Public Wharf or landing in the borough of Birmingham, in the county of Allegheny, passed April 19th 1858, upon the ground that her four lots extended to the low water mark of the river. The plaintiff below claimed under a deed from Dr. Bedford to Patrick McKeag, dated 2d January 1812, after the recording of the plan for “five certain lots or pieces of ground, situate in the town on the south side of the Monongahela river, in St. Clair township, Allegheny county, marked in the general plan of said town Nos. 48, 55, 63, 71, and 105; said lots 49, 55, 63, and 71, lying contiguous to each other, and bounded by Denman street, Virgin alley, Grosvenor street, and the Monongahela river.”</p>
    <p id="b513-8" data-blocks='[["BL_513.8",513,[180,1513,1165,470]]]'>Now this whole conveyance depends upon the general plan. How are yon to tell where Denman street, Virgin alley, and Grosvenor street are, their width and location, or whether it was No. 48 or 49, or where No. 105 was, except for the plan which is the very foundation of the plaintiff’s title, and which must have been seen by the grantee before his deed was executed ? No. 48 is on Denman and Carson streets, at the south end of the town, and No. 105 is on Bingham street, and could not be identified at all except for the plan. The plan is, therefore, an essential muniment of the title of the defendant in error, and she could not proceed a step without it.</p>
    <p id="b513-9" data-blocks='[["BL_513.9",513,[179,1984,1164,429]]]'>Under these circumstances the defendants below offered this plan in evidence, in connection with the testimony of John O’Hern, taken in pursuance of a bill to perpetuate his testimony in No. 108 March Term 1847, in the Court of Common Pleas, with further evidence that this had been a recognised plan of the town of Birmingham for fifty years. If O’Hern’s testimony was admitted, it proved the plan to be a copy, and of course the plan must have been admitted also, as the original was lost or mislaid. The court rejected both, after examining further testimony; the record of the plan was offered again, and it was again rejected.</p>

      <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>It is clear that there was a plan made by direction of Dr. Bedford, upon which the whole title of his intended town was to depend, for he sold by its numbers, and his vendees, particularly Mr. McKeag, purchased by them. All, therefore, had notice, and must have seen his plan somewhere. No doubt some one said, Doctor, put this plan on record; it is a necessary part of our title. "We have seen already that this copy, in the first place, corresponds with the survey on the ground, and that it is accurate ; and as it is conceded there was a plan, where could it come from except from Dr. Bedford, and could it or its original have been made by any one who had not the possession of his title-deed from Ormsby ?</p>
    <p id="b514-6" data-blocks='[["BL_514.6",514,[327,902,1166,259]]]'>The natural presumption, therefore, is, that it was placed.on record by Dr. Bedford, and if so it was competent evidence, and should have been admitted by the court. This plan is fifty years old, made and put on record in the year the town was laid out, and is clearly, with the work on <em>the </em>ground, the work of a surveyor who understood his business.</p>
    <p id="b514-7" data-blocks='[["BL_514.7",514,[328,1160,1164,257]]]'>In connection with this plan was offered the testimony of John O’Hern, taken on the 1st of April 1847, on a bill to perpetuate testimony on the part of the borough of Birmingham, in the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny county, with further evidence that this had been a recognised plan of the town of Birmingham for fifty years.</p>
    <p id="b514-8" data-blocks='[["BL_514.8",514,[328,1417,1164,889]]]'>The witness was a surveyor, and is now dead, and every owner of property was interested in establishing what turned out, after the strictest search for many years past, to be the only paper which can be found purporting either to be the original plan or a copy of it. When, therefore, the bill was filed by the borough, there was no individual whose interest it was to oppose the action of the municipal authorities, for it was an essential muniment of title of every lotholder and citizen of the borough, and, therefore, there was no person against whom the bill could be brought unless they had made defendants the whole population of the town, who were no doubt in favour of their action. If any one had been selected but Mrs. Anderson, according to the present argument, it would not have been evidence against her. Suppose that this plan had been that of a populous city of 100,000 or 600,000 souls, against whom should such a bill be brought? for certainly if there is but one living witness who can prove its plan, there must be some mode of perpetuating his testimony. A city cannot be remediless, simply because it is so large that it is impossible to make all its inhabitants defendants, and therefore you must resort to the only practicable method adopted in this case.</p>
