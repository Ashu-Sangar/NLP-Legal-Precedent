The validity of liens is not a matter within his province to judge of; nor is he, in point of intelligence, always competent to decide upon them. Therefore he has no concern with these matters.

    <p id="b176-8" data-blocks='[["BL_176.9",176,[329,987,1162,506]]]'>In Berks county it was not supposed that the Act of the 6th of April 1830 altered the practice of selling subject to or discharged of liens, except as to mortgages provided for in the act; and soon after, the court adopted a rule, simple in itself, that has repeatedly prevented a sacrifice of property, and apprised lien-creditors as well as purchasers accurately of what was sold, and what was to be paid, and how. Upon the application to set aside the sale, the court thought the rule of court complied with, that the sale was a fair one, and therefore confirmed it, notwithstanding the purchasers objected, and filed exceptions to its confirmation. Nelly Lamm never made any objection at any time.</p>
    <p id="b176-9" data-blocks='[["BL_176.10",176,[328,1501,1159,461]]]'>The rule is as follows: “ In all cases of sheriffs’ sales, if there be a lien or liens charged upon the property proposed to be sold, which is or are not to bo discharged by the sale, it shall be the duty of the sheriff to state specifically, in his conditions of sale, that the property is to be sold subject to such lien or liens, and, as nearly as can be ascertained, the nature and amount of the same, and if the sheriff shall neglect so to do, it shall be a sufficient cause to set aside the sale; and it shall be the duty of the sheriff to set forth, in his deed to the purchaser, the liens to which the property shall have been sold subject, in and by the condition of sale.”</p>

This case is even much clearer than that one, for here the conditions defining the liens to which the sale was subject, were in writing, are expressed in the sheriff’s deed, and have the sanction of a rule of practice of the Common Pleas of thirty years’ standing. This decision makes <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>the purchaser pay exactly according to his purchase, instead of relieving him from $622 of his bid, and leaves the widow her claim unimpaired.</p>
    <p id="A5k" data-blocks='[["BL_177.6",177,[189,531,1164,417]]]'>But the argument in the present case, urges upon us a review of the reasoning in Kurtz’s Appeal, 2 Casey 465, and we have been urged to it before. We are very sure that the decision in that case did exact justice to the parties; but the reasoning in which it is founded has ceased to satisfy us. We think now that the widow’s statutory dower ought not to be treated as a lien on land, but as an interest in it, and that for this reason, also, the decree must be affirmed; because then the fixed lien immediately succeeding it, prevents the discharge of even the accrued interest.</p>
    <p id="b177-7" data-blocks='[["BL_177.7",177,[192,959,1164,432]]]'>We have examined the old Acts of Assembly, 19th April 1794, § 22, 7th April 1807, § 6, and 14th April 1828, § 5, relative to the assignment of the widow’s share in partition, and compared them with the Orphans’ Court Act of 29th March 1832, §§ 41 — ■ 43, and are satisfied that none of them change the character of her estate given by the intestate acts in lieu of dower, but only prescribe the form of assigning it. What her estate really is, is expressed in the Intestate Act of 8th April 1833, § 1: — “ One-third part of the real estate for the term of her life,” and the form in which the law assigns it leaves its character unchanged.</p>
    <p id="AZJ" data-blocks='[["BL_177.8",177,[194,1388,1164,632]]]'>In some cases the amount at which her interest was valued in partition has been incautiously called a lien, when it was not important to distinguish accurately; but at other times it is not improperly so called, that is, when the heirs are claiming it after the widow’s death: 2 Penna.

And in cases where accuracy of denomination was important, it is described as “an interest issuing out of land of the nature of a rent-charge,” and liable to sale by execution: 12 S. &amp; R. 12; 3 Barr 69; <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20458" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 458">3 W. &amp; S. 458</a>; or, “a defined interest in her late husband’s lands — a freehold estate,” passing to a new husband by marriage in the same manner as dower, and liable to execution for his debts (before the Act of 1848): 11 Harris 163.
