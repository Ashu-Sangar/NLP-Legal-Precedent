Instead of receiving the bonds of the company, he was to be paid in cash for work to be done by him in the building and construction of said road. Easton failed to comply fully with the terms of the contract made with the railroad company, and also failed to pay Frederick, the plaintiff, his just dues, but left the state, whereupon these proceedings were instituted by plaintiff in error for the recovery of his money. The company admitted, in their first answers, that at the time of the service of the writ they were indebted to said Easton in a much larger sum than the amount of plaintiff’s claim, although, at the time of filing the said answers, it was impossible to designate the precise amount.</p>

We have some difficulty in understanding the answers of the garnishees, but that is their fault, and the plaintiff must not suffer for it. However, this much seems clear. The garnishees were indebted to the defendant in a much larger sum than was sufficient to satisfy the claim of the plaintiff, but the defendant had been in default with them, and this caused some difficulty which was finally adjusted, and the garnishees paid the defendant in full in their own seven per cent, bonds, payable in twenty years, and counting them as of par value; retaining, however, enough of said bonds to pay the plaintiff’s claim, if they should be received at par. The answer and amended answer leave it somewhat doubtful whether the debt was contracted payable in that way, or whether it was so paid by compromise. It is sufficient, however, that they owed enough to secure the plaintiff’s claim. If they owed it in marketable bonds, the law would have found some way to make the plaintiff’s money out of them, had the garnishees retained enough of them, as they ought to have done.</p>
    <p id="b421-10" data-blocks='[["BL_421.14",421,[204,1889,1163,416]]]'>They confess that they did not retain them, and therefore no judgment against the defendant’s effects, in their hands, can do justice to the plaintiff, and the judgment ought to have been against the garnishees themselves <em>de bonis propriis. </em>They had enough to pay the debt, interest, and costs, and the plaintiff ought to have recovered all this from the garnishees, and it would be their right to deduct it all from the debt due by them to the defendant. The plaintiff is not to suffer by their imprudence in parting with the property after the service of the execution.</p>
