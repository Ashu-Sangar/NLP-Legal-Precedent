This will was dated October 11th 1849. On the 21st of April 1859, a codicil was attached, in which his nephew James was substituted for William, who was deceased. The devisees were also named as executors.</p>

The evidence on these points was conflicting, and somewhat contradictory. At the close of the case, the plaintiffs were permitted by the court below (Burlington, P. J.) to prove that as far back as twenty or thirty years before his death, the deceased had repeatedly declared that “ he would leave his lands in the name of Neel.”</p>

It was contested by the heirs. The plaintiffs, — the Neels, — were the devisees. It was assailed on two grounds. First, for want of mental capacity in John Neel to make a will. Secondly, on account of alleged undue influence by members of the family of the devisees.</p>
    <p id="b484-8" data-blocks='[["BL_484.13",484,[336,885,1152,297]]]'>The testimony received and excepted to was of declarations of the testator, running hack to a period of nearly thirty years, and up to within a much later period, that he intended to “ leave his farm in the name of Neel,” and similar expressions, to witnesses at different and distant intervals. The reception of the evidence constitutes the first bill of exception, and is the only assignment of error in the case.</p>
    <p id="b484-9" data-blocks='[["BL_484.14",484,[336,1181,1152,599]]]'>We are of opinion that it was clearly competent, certainly on the point of undue influence. It would strongly rebut the idea of any such influence on the mind of the testator when making his will, if it were shown that he made it in accordance with a long-cherished purpose, and especially when in the execution of that purpose he was keeping it, not only in the name but amongst his own blood-relations. This was the purpose of the evidence, and it is sustainable on express and clear authority: Sterrit <em>v. </em>Douglass, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Yates%20Sel.%20Cas.%2046" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Yates Sel.
