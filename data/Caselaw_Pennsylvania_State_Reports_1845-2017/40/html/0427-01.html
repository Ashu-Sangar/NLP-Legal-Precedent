    <p id="b429-8" data-blocks='[["BL_429.14",429,[177,1020,1163,857]]]'>This is very right. The 27th and 32d sections of the Act of 1834, relating to executors and administrators, have nothing to do with the proceeding; it is governed entirely by the 33d section. That requires that the administrator be warned to appear and show cause against the issuing of the execution. This expression defines the purpose of the appearance. The law takes the judgment for verity, but requires that when the defendant is dead his'representative shall take his place, and shall have an opportunity of showing any cause known to him, arising since the judgment, why the plaintiff should not have execution. The fact that defendant is administrator he does not mean to deny, and this fact and the previous judgment entitles the plaintiffs to their execution, unless the administrator appear and show some such cause against it as would have entitled the decedent himself to a stay, or to a modification of the execution, on account of payments, or otherwise. But such a judgment does not prevent a stay in order to let the administrator apply for a sale of the property under the direction of the Orphans’ Court. Judgment of substitution, and that execution issue, would have been a better entry.</p>
