Leiby was not in possession either in law or fact. Blizzard being thus in possession, it was notice to all persons dealing with him, that his title alone, was to be looked to as security ; if such persons looked further than the possession, they were not warranted by the statute in so doing, and the contract itself informed them, if they looked to it, that neither Leiby nor his'estate was to be responsible.</p>

A lease for three or six months to a builder and possession under it, with a contract to build a house on the lot for the owner, would be exactly a ease for no lien a.t all; for the builder would be in possession without the house being erected at his instance, and the owner would have had it erected without being in possession.
