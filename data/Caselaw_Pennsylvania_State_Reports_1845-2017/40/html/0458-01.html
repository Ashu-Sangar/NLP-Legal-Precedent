It does not contain nor set out “ a copy of the instrument of writing” (being in this case two notes) “on which action was brought;” but simply “a statement or specification” of them, which is only allowable when that upon which suit is brought “ is not in writing.” In this case his notes ■were in writing, and he was bound by the rule to file “a copy” of them.</p>

It is sworn to and claims to have been sworn to before one “ S. B. Nicholson,” major of the city of Maysville, in the state of Kentucky. Is he an <em>authorized </em>magistrate to administer oaths to be used in the District Court of Allegheny county, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania ? Is he a magistrate at all recognised and known by that court for any purpose, much less for the administration of oaths to be used in the proper and legal administration of its justice ? If so, by whose authority ? Certainly not by any rule or decision of that court; certainly not by any rule or decision of this court; certainly not by any law or laws upon the statute books of this state; and equally certainly not by any law or laws upon the statute books of the United States. Is he such an one, and is the corporate seal of the city of Maysville, in the state of Kentucky, of such a character that any civil or even criminal court in the state of Pennsylvania could or would recognise either the one or the other, without extraneous proof of their existence and character ? Is this verification or <em>jurat </em>before this so-called mayor, of such a character that an indictment for perjury could be predicated upon it, and successfully prosecuted in the county of Allegheny, in the Commonweath of Pennsylvania ? To all of these interrogatories it is contended and insisted upon negatively by the plaintiff in error. The office and functions of a mayor are criminal and not civil, and outside of his limited and peculiar duties he has not any power whatever; certainly none to administer oaths to be used in a civil proceeding in a foreign state: Chew <em>v. </em>Keck, <a href="/rawle/4/0163-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Rawle 163" data-case-ids="1823536" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0163-01">4 Rawle 163</a>; Leasure <em>v. </em>Hillegas, 7 S. &amp; R. 313, 318; 1 Greenl. on Ev. 642, § 606; Miller <em>v. </em>Henshaw, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Dana%20329" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Dana 329">4 Dana 329</a>; Behn <em>v. </em>Towney, 21 Georgia R. 207; Wilburn <em>v. </em>Hall, 16 Miss.
