A debt due to a third person by the plaintiff in an execution, under which the goods of his debtor, the defendant, are taken by the sheriff but not sold, may be attached in the hands of such defendant, by attachment process, from a justice of the peace; and after judgment on the attachment, it is entitled to payment out of the proceeds of the sale paid into court for distribution.</p>

The rule that money in the hands of the sheriff, in his official capacity, cannot be attached, does not apply to an attachment made pending the levy, nor is the levy, as between the debtor and creditor, a satisfaction of the debt; therefore, up to the time of the sale, there was a debt due to the plaintiff in the execution, which was liable to attachment at the suit of his creditors.</p>

Before this judgment, but after the attachment, the sheriff’s sale <em>took </em>place.

Possibly he might have defeated the attachment-execution process, if he had tried it before the justice. But he did not, and thus a portion of his claim against Gumpertson was appropriated by the law to pay his debt <em>to </em>Smith &amp; Co., and it was right in the court to give this effect to the judgment of the justice.
