No doubt the father intended that the amount should be deducted from the daughter’s share. in this estate, and so he directed by his will. It Avas therefore an advancement, and none the less so because made to the husband of the daughter. It was the father’s mode of benefiting the daughter, by enabling her husband to procure a farm, and by his will she was charged with it as an advancement. Advancements to a married daughter in gifts to her husband are not uncommon. Thus in Wentz <em>v. </em>Dehaven, 1 S. &amp; R. 312, a release of a bond and mortgage by a father-in-law to the husband of his daughter, was held to be an advancement to her. See also Hayden <em>v. </em>Mentzer, 10 S. &amp; R. 333, 11 Iredell 68, <a href="/mass/67/0587-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Gray 587" data-case-ids="1973995" data-case-paths="/mass/67/0587-01">1 Gray 587</a>.

Not, certainly, in consequence of any undertaking of the husband, for there was none. When the claim for the purchase-money of the farm was remitted, the accountant ceased to OAve the $Í627.75 to his father-in-law, and he assumed to pay it to no one else. If any <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>debt was then created, it was the debt of the wife, not of her husband. The donor no longer considered him a debtor.

    <p id="b29-6" data-blocks='[["BL_29.6",29,[198,748,1165,766]]]'>The other position of the appellant, that the husband is chargeable because he received his wife’s money, and there is no proof that it ever became his, is equally untenable. It assumes what is in direct conflict with the facts. The $1627.75 never was her property. It belonged to her father until it was acquitted to the husband. The cases cited to show that the money of a wife, which comes into the hands of her husband, is his at common law, or remains hers, according to his intention when he receives it, and that since the Act of April 11th 1848, it is presumed .to be hers, have, therefore, no application here. Johnston <em>v. </em>Johnston’s Administrators, the case principally relied on, is totally unlike this. There the money received by the husband belonged to the wife when it came into his hands. Obtained after the Act of 1848, it was presumed to have been received for her. She might have lent it to her husband, and he would have been under obligation to pay it. But the Act of 1848 has nothing to do with property which never was the wife’s. She cannot lend to her husband what she has not.</p>
