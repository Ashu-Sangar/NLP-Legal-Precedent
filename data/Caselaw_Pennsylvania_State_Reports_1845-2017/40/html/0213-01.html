Though one verdict and judgment in ejectment upon an equitable title is conclusive between the parties, and a bar to any subsequent ejectment for the same land, yet in order to have this effect, the judgment upon the verdict must have been regularly entered on the record: it is not enough that the jury fee was paid after verdict, and an entry thereof indexed in the lien docket.</p>

In an action of ejectment by F. &amp; B., the holders of the legal title to the undivided half of a tract of land, against S., who claimed under an equitable title, a verdict was returned for the defendant, but, the charge of the court being excepted to, no judgment was regularly entered upon the verdict: the jury fee was paid by the defendant, and the verdict indexed in the lien docket. A second ejectment for the same land, and between the same parties, was brought, and a verdict found for the plaintiffs, upon which judgment was regularly entered, whieh was never reversed. Afterwards a third ejectment was brought by S. against F. &amp; B., and a verdict rendered for the plaintiff, which was reversed by the Supreme Court, and a new trial ordered. On the new trial, S., the plaintiff, set up and relied upon the record of the verdict in the first ejectment as a bar to defendant’s recovery; whereon judgment was entered for the plaintiff by the court below. <em>Held, </em>that the record was not a bar, and no defence, for there had been no judgment entered upon the verdict, the payment of the jury fee and the entry upon the lien docket not being equivalent thereto ; that there being a verdict and judgment in favor of the defendants, F. &amp; B., in the second ejectment, it was conclusive in their favor —and that judgment should have been entered for them by the Court below.</p>

On the third trial, Staver sets up that rule, and relies solely on it.

The lien docket is not the <em>record </em>of judgments, but the essential index of them as a general rule, and there is no exception in favour of this case. It does not make a judgment, but refers to one supposed to he already made. There is none such; and it would be quite a surprise, and even a trap, to infer one; for the parties never thought, until now, of regarding the first trial as being so efficient.
