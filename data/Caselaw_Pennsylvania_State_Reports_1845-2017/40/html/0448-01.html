Upon the principle that one for whose use and benefit a promise is made, if upon sufficient consideration, may maintain an action on it, it was held in Beers <em>v. </em>Robinson, 9 Barr 229, that where A. promises B. to pay B.’s debts, so far as the consideration received would go, the creditor of B. may maintain an action on the promise. And to the same effect are Vincent <em>v. </em>Watson, 6 Harris 96; Bell <em>v. </em>Fagely, 7 Harris 273; and Ayer’s Appeal, 4 Casey 179. A distinction is taken in Blymire <em>v. </em>Boistle, <a href="/watts/6/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts 182" data-case-ids="1846089" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0182-01">6 Watts 182</a>, and the rule is there laid down, that if one receive money from another for the use of a third person, or having money belonging to another, agree with that other to pay it to a third, action lies by the person beneficially interested. But where the contract is for the benefit of the contracting party, and the third person is a stranger to the contract and consideration, the action must be by the promissee. This distinction is recognised and approved by Justice Kennedy in DeBolle <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Insurance Company, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Whart.%2074" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Whart. 74">4 Wh. 74</a>, and Hubbert <em>v. </em>Borden, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Whart.%2094" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Whart. 94">6 Wh. 94</a>.</p>

Gladstone conveyed the lot, but Blymire did not pay the judgment according to his agreement, and Boistle brought suit against him. And the question was, whether the action was rightly brought. It was held that the action should have been brought in the name of Gladstone, the contracting party for whose benefit the agreement was made, and not in the name of Boistle, who was a stranger to the contract and consideration.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b450-7" data-blocks='[["BL_450.7",450,[317,1667,1164,725]],["BL_451.1",451,[202,369,1167,256]]]'>“It is suggested by Justice Rogers, in Esling <em>v. </em>Zantzinger, 1 Harris 50, that the decision would have been different if Boistle had participated in the contract; that is, if the three had met together, and Blymire had expressly promised Boistle to pay the judgment. And accordingly it was held in Esling <em>v. </em>Zantzinger, that where a landlord gave a creditor an order on his tenant to pay the creditor the rent as it became due, which was accepted by the tenant, that a liability by the tenant in favour of the creditor was thereby created, which could be enforced by an action in the name of the creditor, and that the tenant’s liability to the action was grounded not merely on the extinguishment of his liability to the landlord, but mainly on the express promise, for which there was a sufficient consideration. In reference to Blymire <em>v. </em>Boistle, and other cases relied on by the defendant to defeat the action in that ease, the learned judge says: <em>‘ </em>In all of these the privity of contract, which is indispensable to the maintenance of the suit in the name of the original creditor, is <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>wanting.’ The decision in Finney <em>v. </em>Finney, 4 Harris 380, is put expressly on the ground of the want of privity of contract between the parties, and for this reason it was there held that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, though the court, from the manifest unfairness of the defendant’s conduct in withholding the fund from all parties, was anxious to sustain the action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b451-6" data-blocks='[["BL_451.6",451,[197,626,1171,1462]]]'>“ The case of The Commercial Bank <em>v. </em>Wood, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 89" data-case-ids="481747" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0089-01">7 W. &amp; S. 89</a>, falls clearly within the distinction taken in Blymire <em>v. </em>Boistle, though, in delivering the opinion of the court, Kennedy, J., seems to lay stress on the fact that the plaintiffs subsequently assented to the arrangement made by their debtor with the bank for the payment of the note held by them. The arrangement was this : The bank received from Piatt, the agent of McCoy, <em>as cash, </em>a draft drawn by the Commercial and Railroad Bank of Vicksburg on the Girard Bank of Philadelphia, and agreed with him to pay McCoy’s note, held by the plaintiffs, Wood &amp; Abbott; and in an action on this promise it was held that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. The decision is put mainly on the ground that the bank, having taken the draft as money, received it in trust for the plaintiffs, and McCoy’s indebtedness to them was a sufficient consideration for the creation and support of the trust thus created in their favour, and the right to the use of the money passed thereby to them, so as to entitle them to demand and receive it from the bank. Perhaps the true reason, if there be one, for the distinction is here indicated, viz.: Where the promissor receives the fund, or other consideration of the promise, in trust for a third party, there the action may be in the name of the latter. But, with the exception hereafter noticed, in all other cases the action must be brought in the name of him from whom the consideration moved, or too was the meritorious cause of it, whether, as in Blymire <em>v. </em>Boistle, Ramsdale <em>v. </em>Plorton, 3 Barr 330, and other like cases, the promise be made to him from whom the consideration moved, or, as in Edmondson <em>v. </em>Penney, 1 Barr 334, and Comfort <em>v. </em>Eisenbies, <a href="/nc/46/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Jones 13" data-case-ids="8680990" data-case-paths="/nc/46/0013-01">1 Jones 13</a>, it be made to a stranger to the consideration. The exception to the rule is in the case of an express promise, upon a sufficient consideration, to pay a third party, where the latter participates in the contract; and in such case, as we have seen in Esling <em>v. </em>Zantzinger, the action may be maintained, by reason of the privity of contract, in the name of the third party.</p>
