    <p id="b71-6" data-blocks='[["BL_71.6",71,[198,786,1177,948]]]'>It is a recognised principle of equity practice, that when an answer negatives the allegations it contains, and no further testimony is adduced in its support, the court will dismiss it, as of course. This is analogous to the <em>declaration </em>and <em>flea </em>at law. In the latter case, there is allegation and denial; the parties stand <em>in equilibrio, </em>and the testimony of a single witness will decide the issue on either side. In the former, there is also allegation and denial, but in each under oath, and, therefore, on principles of strict reasoning, a like equilibrium should result,, and the testimony of a single disinterested witness, sustaining the-allegations of the bill, should be sufficient to turn the scale. Otherwise we are compelled to adopt the anomalous doctrine, that at law one witness is sufficient, but in equity, two are required. The rule now in force in England, of allowing both parties to a suit at law to testify, and in which, where they negatived each others’ testimony, the oath of a single disinterested and credible witness would prevail, is believed to furnish the true doctrine of equity practice in this réspect, and this would seem to be the doctrine laid down in Brightly’s Equity, § 720: Horton’s Appeal, 1 Harris 71; Baker <em>v. </em>Williamson, 4 Barr 468.

In a resulting trust, can the trustee execute a conveyance of the legal title to persons other than the <em>cestui que trust, </em>without the authority of the latter in writing, or proof of such authority, if denied by evidence outside of his own declaration ? If this doctrine should be adopted, it is easy to see that every <em>cestui que trust </em>must be at <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>the mercy of the trustee, for to divert the trust estate all that is necessary would be to make a declaration of trust to that effect, and allege that it was done in obedience to the directions of the beneficiary.</p>

As a trustee, Daniel L. Bitting was bound to convey according to the <em>cestui que trust’s </em>direction, and if the conveyance had been made to her in fee, and she had thereupon executed a declaration of trust, but retained the writing in her possession and under her control, a power of revocation existed. No difference in principle is perceived between the case supposed, and the one under consideration. They are both substantially the act of Susan Hassler; in neither case is the control of the deed parted with, or the trust in remainder consummated by delivery: Maynard <em>v. </em>Maynard, <a href="/mass/10/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="10 Mass. 456" data-case-ids="2027022" data-case-paths="/mass/10/0448-01">10 Mass. 456</a>; Eames <em>v. </em>Phillippi, <a href="/johns/12/0418-02" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="12 Johns. 418" data-case-ids="2139176,2139277" data-case-paths="/johns/12/0418-02,/johns/12/0418-01">12 Johns. 418</a>; Stilwell <em>v. </em>Hubbard, <a href="/wend/20/0044-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="20 Wend. 44" data-case-ids="2150246" data-case-paths="/wend/20/0044-01">20 Wend. 44</a>. Nor can delivery to the complainant be held to be a delivery to the others named in the assignment. To accept the deed, under those circumstances, was probably the only way in which the trustees would consent to part with the title, and the fact of not recording it, and keeping it entirely under her control, was evidence of an intention to retain the power to revoke. The respondent declares in his answer, that the complainant put the deed into the hands of Jeremiah D. Bitting for safe keeping; but as this was not responsive to anything alleged in the bill, it would be no evidence, unless supported <em>aliunde. </em>Even if evidence in the cause, which it certainly is against the respondent, it shows no delivery. It was left with Jeremiah D. Bitting for a specific object, <em>viz.: for safe keeping, </em>and liable to reclamation at the will and pleasure of the complainant. Having been put in a place of deposit merely for secure custody, it did not pass out' of her possession or control. This was also the understanding of the bailee, for if the fact is as the respondent alleges, the deed was redelivered to her, as it was in her possession at the time of her death. The case of Simonton’s Estate, <a href="/watts/4/0180-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="4 Watts 180" data-case-ids="1842779" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0180-01">4 Watts 180</a>, does not apply, for there innocent-parties were to be affected. To the same effect is Blight <em>v. </em>Schenck, 10 Barr 285. In the present case, there was no change in the <em>status </em>of the parties, nor is there any pretence that either of those named in remainder paid any consideration for, or ever had any possession of the property in question, or expended any money on the faith of the assignment, or would sustain any legal injury by the cancellation of said declaration of trust. Cases can be found in which a delivery has been held without an actual delivery of the deed. <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>But, in those instances, it will be found that no revocation took place in the lifetime of the grantor, whereas, in this case, it was doubly revoked; first, by the bill in equity, and again by the last will and testament of complainant.</p>
