As a purchaser he was bound to know the law, and that the stock was liable to the bank for any indebtedness of William McKinney to it at the time of his levy, and he took the risk of existing debts to the bank when he bought. By the sale, he acquired a right to the stock, only in case the indebtedness of the proprietor to the bank was otherwise extinguished. Or he could have rendered his title complete by payment of the debt himself. This he did not think it expedient to do. Previously to the date of Mehaffy’s judgment, the bank obtained judgment by confession against the maker, John, and the endorser, William McKinney, and subsequently against both endorsers for the amount of the note. Execution on the first of these judgments proving unavailable, on the 16th November 1858, an <em>alias fi. fa. </em>was -issued; and also at the same time an execution on <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>tbe judgment against William McKinney and the plaintiff. Both judgments were for the debt created by the note. The stock was seized on both executions and sold on the first, as appears by the sheriff’s return. After the seizure and before the sale, the bank assigned the judgments to Mr. Armstrong. These transfers carried with them any rights of the bank under the judgments and executions, and unless the receipt of the debt from Armstrong, one of the defendants, must be taken as a satisfaction of them, he has all the rights of the bank, and entitled to all its remedies, by virtue of the assignments: Foster <em>v. </em>Fox, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 92" data-case-ids="1856233" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0092-01">4 W. &amp; S. </a><em><a href="/watts-serg/4/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 92" data-case-ids="1856233" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0092-01">92</a>.</em>

I know of no principle of law which will hold the 'judgments to be satisfied against the intention and contract of the parties. The defendants do not object to it, and Mehaffy is placed in no different position by it, from that in which he would have stood, had the bank proceeded in the execution for its own use, instead of the use of Armstrong. By the course adopted the latter secured to himself at least partial contribution from a joint promissor. With the equities between them Mehaffy has nothing to do. The bank never relinquished its hold on the stock, which, we have seen, was good against Mehaffy, and Armstrong, standing in her shoes, has her rights. We think, therefore, that the right to the stock passed by the sale to plaintiff, and that</p>
