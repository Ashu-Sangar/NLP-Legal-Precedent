In an execution-attachment, the plaintiff is placed in the position and acquires the rights of his debtor, as regards the garnishee; and after an answer filed and issue joined, the same presumptions of law arise upon the trial from any particular evidence, as if there had been no attachment, and the suit had been by the creditor of the garnishee against him.</p>

The garnishees in an attachment answered to the interrogatories, that they had no goods or effects of the defendant, and that nothing was due him by them. Issue being joined on the plea of <em>nulla bona, </em>upon the trial, the plaintiff showed that one of the garnishees had been indebted to the defendant for sawing upon contract a large amount of lumber, but did not show any indebtedness at the time of or since the attachment; nor did the garnishee show any payment or set-off, which would have been a defence had suit been brought for the manufacture of the lumber. <em>Held, </em>that the contract and performance being proved, and no payment or set-off shown, the presumption arose that the money earned had not been paid; that from the facts in evidence, the conclusion of law was, that the garnishee had funds in possession sufficient to satisfy the judgment, and that the instruction of the court below to the jury, to find for the defendant on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to make out a case, was error.</p>

The interrogatories are not “were you not some time ago,” but “are you not now,” and “were you not at the service of the writ, indebted,” &amp;c. The language of the Act of June 13th 1836 is, “from and after the service of the writ all debts, &amp;c., shall remain attached.” The plaintiff must show indebtedness at the time of the service; if not, a verdict might be had for money paid by the garnishee years before.</p>

If Fields had a right of action against Mrs. Ellis for the $2457, which he had earned by sawing lumber for her, Fessler acquired that right to the extent of his judgment against Fields. He was as well entitled to call on Mrs. Ellis to pay him the amount of his judgment, as Fields was to call on her to pay the whole of her apparent indebtedness.</p>
    <p id="b250-5" data-blocks='[["BL_250.5",250,[297,382,1172,1147]]]'>
      <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>True it is, that, under the Act of Assembly, Mrs. Ellis, as garnishee, was liable only for moneys in her hands belonging to Fields at the time Fessler laid his attachment, the 4th February 1859. But suppose, instead of Fessler’s attachment, Fields had brought suit against her as of that date, had shown the manufacture of the lumber for her in the years 1856-7, 8 and 9, to an amount exceeding $2000, and she had shown no payment, set-off, or defence whatever. Can there be any doubt that Fields would have recovered ? Why should he not ? The contract and his performance of it were fully proved. .The money was earned, and was not shown to have been paid. The necessary <em>primd facie </em>presumption would be that it was still due. And if that presumption would have arisen, on such proofs, in a suit by Fields, the same presumption belongs to his creditor, Fessler, coming in ■as an attaching creditor. That presumption is, that moneys earned before 4th February 1859, and not shown to have been paid, were due and owing on that day. A debt once proved is presumed to exist till its extinguishment is proved. Even when the remedy for it is barred by the Statute of Limitations, the law does not presume extinguishment of the debt. But here there was no bar of remedies, and no ground laid for a presumption of extinguishment. The necessary conclusion of reason and of law is, therefore, that at the time the attachment was executed, the garnishee had funds in her hands, belonging to the defendant, sufficient to satisfy his debt to the plaintiff. The court erred, therefore, in holding that the plaintiff had failed to make out his case.</p>
