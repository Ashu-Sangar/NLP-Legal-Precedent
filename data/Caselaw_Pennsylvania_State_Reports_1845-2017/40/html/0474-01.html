David Jackson made a will in the presence of his wife, and upon consultation with her, in which he devised the land in dispute to the brothers and sisters of Mrs. Jackson, James Fuller being one of them. In this will this land was divided into eight shares, and James Fuller received two shares and one half, while the others received but one share each. Some time after the making of this will Mrs. Jackson died, when it was thought that portions of the will would have to be altered, and it was alleged by Jackson that Fuller procured the alteration at a time when his mind AYas Aveighed doAvn by grief at the loss of his wife, and that by reason of his weakness both of mind and body, occasioned by his constant watching and anxiety during the sickness of his AYife, as well as by his very advanced age (he being over eighty years at the time), the grantee Avas enabled to overreach and defraud him. It was in evidence that Fuller stayed AYith Jackson the night after his wife’s funeral, and made arrangements with him to convey this farm, and that one Aveek after the funeral he came to the house of Jackson, and had the deed drawn up according to his OAvn wish.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b475-8" data-blocks='[["BL_475.8",475,[154,1551,1162,471]]]'>The scrivener testified that when he came to the consideration, he asked what consideration was to be mentioned ? that some one said, one dollar ; but Fuller said, “ Say one thousand dollars, and other services” — Avhich was done.

He also stated that Jackson said, several times, “James, I am afraid I am giving you too much; I don’t intend to give you but $6000;” and that Jackson estimated this property to be worth betAveen $8000 and $9000. At the time this deed was made, a will was signed by Jackson, giving to James Fuller the one-half of his personal property, which, according <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>to the evidence, was worth from $10,000 to $12,000; also, that when Jaclcson expressed a wish to give a portion of this personal property to David Fuller and John Fuller (his brothers), James objected, saying that they deserved nothing, and the whole amount was then given to himself, he having to pay out $2000 to other heirs.

There was testimony given to show that Jackson’s mind was very much affected by the loss of his wife, that he lay around the house, on the floor, walked his room at late hours of the night, and gave many manifestations of overwhelming grief. The witness stated also that on the night of her death he gave positive indications of mental derangement ; that he said he was glad she was dead, and while the corpse was lying in the room he was talking about the weight of cattle, the price of cattle, and other unseasonable subjects. Evidence was also given for the purpose of showing that Fuller did not consider Jackson capable of taking care of his own interests at the time the deed was made, and that after this transaction Fuller said that ho had urged Jackson to make this conveyance at the time he did, because he knew if he had waited longer he would not have done it.</p>
