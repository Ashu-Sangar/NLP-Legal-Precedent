Prior to that time the firm owed the defendant, Shoemaker, $485, for which they gave him their judgment, made part of this finding. They also gave said Shoemaker a mortgage for $1000, to cover future expected advances, but none were ever made under it. Said Harper &amp; Reese had, prior to that time, built a shop and certain machinery on a lot of said Shoemaker, rented by them ■ at $60 per annum, and Shoemaker had placed therein certain lathes and planing-machines, worth about $1300, for their use, but the property was to remain his until paid for. No time of payment was fixed, but it was to be done when they were able, they paying interest in the mean time. In June 1859, Shoemaker issued a <em>ft. fa. </em>on bis judgment of $485 aforesaid, and levied on all the property of the firm, the sheriff closing the shop. On the 22d day of June 1859, the said Harper &amp; Reese made a bill of sale to said Shoemaker of their shop, all the materials, fixtures, book accounts, &amp;c., for the nominal consideration of $1500, but nothing whatever was paid except the debt of $485, which still stood open ; but Shoemaker then agreed with Harper that if they (the firm) would make him the bill of sale, he (Shoemaker) would pay all the debts owing by the said firm of Harper &amp; Reese, and carry on the shop for one year, giving employment to them, paying them by the day, and giving to the said Harper extra wages. At the time this arrangement was proposed, Shoemaker inquired of Harper how much the bills (being the debts) <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>due by the said firm amounted to, and was informed that the bills (being the debts) they owed were between $500 and $600; and he then agreed, in consideration that the said firm would make him the bill of sale aforesaid, he, the said Shoemaker, would pay all the debts of the firm, and carry on the shop as aforesaid. We find that the property assigned to Shoemaker, including the claims due the firm of Harper &amp; Reese, were worth $1885, and that all of the debts of the firm amounted to about $1315, exclusive of Shoemaker’s.</p>

We find that no direct or express promise was made by Shoemaker to King to pay him the debt in dispute, and have no other evidence of his (King’s) acquiescence in the promise made to Harper than is implied from his (King’s) bringing this suit, from which we find that he (King) agreed to accept said promise.</p>

The authorities cited by the court below fully establish the doctrine that a promise to one for the benefit of another, enables that person to sue in his own name : See Hinds <em>v. </em>Holdship, <a href="/watts/2/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Watts 104" data-case-ids="1840135" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0104-01">2 Watts 104</a>.</p>

He undertook for his own benefit, and for a valuable consideration, to pay another’s debt in discharge of his own. The consideration was new and original, being the assignment to himself of all the effects of King’s debtor, and the contract was between different parties. On each of these points, the authorities cited by the court below show the case not to be within the Statute of Frauds. The object of the statute being to prevent fraud, it would be a perversion of its intention to apply its provisions whore the promissor has deprived the creditor of the means of collecting his debt, and received property far beyond the amount of his assumption.</p>
