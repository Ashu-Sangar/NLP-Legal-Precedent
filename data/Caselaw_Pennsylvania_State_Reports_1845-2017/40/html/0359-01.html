If the jury find the facts to be as alleged, it seems to me, and I so instruct the jury, that the sheriff thereby rendered himself liable to the plaintiff for the value of the goods, in case it should turn out — as it has — that Baelz had no interest in them as a partner of Eebey.</p>

The plaintiff below and his counsel offered to give security to the sheriff, and upon their return from their search for the sureties who were proposed, the counsel was informed that Dr. Baelz had the key of the store.
