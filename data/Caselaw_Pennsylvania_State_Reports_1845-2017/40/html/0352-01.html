    <p id="b358-6" data-blocks='[["BL_358.6",358,[302,1309,1165,929]]]'>In Young <em>v. </em>McClure, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 147" data-case-ids="1853591" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0147-01">2 W. &amp; S. 147</a>, this Court said, following established doctrine and developing nothing new, “ The question, however, is not in these cases (of retained possession by a vendor), whether under all the circumstances the transfer is in good faith and without design to cover the property, or to delay or hinder creditors. It is an <em>inflexible </em>rule which makes it fraud <em>per se, </em>if the possession does not follow as well as accompany the transfer: Clow <em>v. </em>Woods, 5 S. &amp; R. 275; Babb <em>v. </em>Clemson, 10 S. &amp; R. 419; Carpenter <em>v. </em>Moyer, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%20485" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Watts 485">5 Watts 485</a>; Hamilton <em>v. </em>Russell, <a href="/us/5/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Cranch 309" data-case-ids="12123191" data-case-paths="/us/5/0309-01">1 Cranch 309</a>. If it was a fraud in law, without regard to the intent of the parties, it becomes a question for the court and not for the jury to decide : Dornick <em>v. </em>Reichenbach, 10 S. &amp; R. 84; Carpenter <em>v. </em>Mayer, <a href="/watts/5/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="5 Watts 483" data-case-ids="1844087" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0483-01">5 Watts 483</a>. There being no evidence to show that the possession accompanied and followed the transfer, the plaintiff failed in making out his case, and the court, on the evidence, ought so to have instructed the jury:” see also 6 Casey 639; 6 Harris 113; and particularly, Twyne’s Case, 1 Smith’s Lead. Cas. 47, 5th ed., Am. note; where this whole subject is fully and learnedly examined, and the law stated in accordance with the principles here declared. We think the learned judge erred in the manner indicated, and the judgment must be reversed.</p>
