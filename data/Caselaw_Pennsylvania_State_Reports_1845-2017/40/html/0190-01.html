This note Daniel Housum endorsed, for the accommodation of the drawers, who had the same discounted for their own use at the said office. When this note fell due, Norton &amp; Clymer were unable to pay it, and it was renewed by another note, dated September 17th 1857, for the same sum, drawn and endorsed by the same parties, and payable at the same place, sixty days after the date thereof. Soon after the making of this note, Thomas Allibone, the president of the Bank of Pennsylvania, made arrangements with John Welsh, agent for certain of the Philadelphia banks, by which it was agreed that the said banks should advance the sum of six hundred thousand dollars to <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>the Bank of Pennsylvania, to sustain her credit, in consideration of which, Allibone agreed to pass to the said banks certain bills receivable as collateral security. In pursuance of this arrangement the Philadelphia banks advanced to the Bank of Pennsylvania, $504,000, on the 23d of September 1857, and $163,000 on the 24th of the same -month; and Thomas Allibone passed over into the hands of John Welsh the sum of $718,000 in bills receivable, belonging to the Bank of Pennsylvania. Among these was the note on which this suit is founded, it having been sent to Philadelphia, from the branch at Reading, by David McKnight, the cashier, at the request of the president. It was then passed by John Welsh, or by Welsh and Robbins, into the hands of the plaintiffs in this suit, who allege that they hold it as trustees of the banks who advanced the money to the Bank of Pennsylvania. Before it fell due, it was sent to the Farmers’ Bank of Reading for collection, and when it matured, was renewed November 18th 1857, by another note of the same makers and endorser, for the same sum, and payable ninety days after date, at the Farmers’ Bank of Reading. At the time of the last renewal Daniel Housum, the endorser, was not told, nor did he know, that the note had passed from the Bank of Pennsylvania, nor was he aware of that fact until the time it fell due. The printed notice that he received, showing the time when the last note matured, was to the effect that the note was at the office of discount and deposit.</p>

Subsequently, however, he procured notes of the Pennsylvania Bank, which he tendered in payment of this claim. This action was then brought against him, and on the trial the .court below (Jones, P.

Had he a right to pay the note in the depreciated paper of the Bank of Pennsylvania to an assignee who had paid full value for it to the bank ? The court below said no, and we think they answered correctly.</p>
    <p id="b193-8" data-blocks='[["BL_193.12",193,[181,1540,1165,729]]]'>The analogies furnished by the cases cited in the argument are sufficient to justify the ruling of the court, but a reason which is decisive against the plaintiff in error may be drawn from the nature of the instrument he subscribed. It was a negotiable note. By his endorsement, the plaintiff in error meant to give it credit, into whose hands soever it should lawfully come for value. When he finds it in the hands of the trustees of other banks, who came forward in a vain endeavour to sustain the sinking fortunes of the Bank of Pennsylvania, and paid more money than the notes were worth which the Bank of Pennsylvania transferred to them, how can he refuse to perform his contract ? What equity has he to ask such trustees to receive the almost worthless notes of the broken bank in discharge of his liability ? He made a transferable instrument. He knew it might be transferred for value, and he was shown on the trial that it had been transferred <em>bond fide </em>and for full value. Then let him meet it as he meets other pecuniary obligations.</p>

Doubtless the arrangement made through Mr. Welsh was unusual and extraor<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>dinary, but it was an honest transaction. It seemed to' be demanded by the exigencies of the occasion. It was designed to benefit the public, to protect the stockholders of the'Bank of Pennsylvania, and to maintain a sound paper currency. Of what moment, then, that the transfer of this note, influenced by such laudable motives, and paid for in solid cash, was not in the usual course of business ? It gave the transferees a legal and equitable title to the note, and they have a right to demand its redemption in the constitutional currency, or its equivalent.</p>
    <p id="b194-6" data-blocks='[["BL_194.6",194,[314,776,1157,548]]]'>It is argued that the Bank of Pennsylvania had no power under her charter to transfer the note. The plaintiff in error is not in position to raise that question. His contract was not enlarged or impaired by the transfer. He gave his note a transferable quality, and seeing that it was transferred with the consent of the holder, and for value before it fell due — and seeing, especially, that he joined the' drawers in renewing it after the transfer, and after the failure of the Bank of Pennsylvania was known to him, we do not consider him at liberty to raise the question of charter powers, which is suggested in the argument. As nobody interested in the assets of the bank is here to question the transfer, a <em>debtor </em>of the bank is not the proper party to do it.</p>
