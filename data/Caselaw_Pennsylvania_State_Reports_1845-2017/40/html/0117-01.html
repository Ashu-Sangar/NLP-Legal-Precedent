It often merely embodies an idea, leaving it to the courts to give it practical efficiency. It is often mangled in its legislative form by the conflict and compromise by which it is beset in its passage through the law-making body. These early statutes, designed to give effect to a new idea, are always difficult.of application from these and like causes.</p>

The legislature obviously designed to encourage manufacturing enterprise, and at the same time to prevent organizations proceeding upon a large nominal but small real capital. The capitalist and the person of small but surplus means were equally invited to take part in these enterprises, by the assurance that there was no risk incurred beyond the extent of the subscription for stock. Any indefinite universal liability it was felt would repel capital, for it would be the act of folly or madness for any man of means to go into a concern not managed by himself, not controlled by himself, if by so doing he staked his whole fortune on a subscription, it might be, to a half dozen shares of its stock.</p>

We suppose that this was soon found to be an invitation to fraud, and that when the evil day was seen by the more sagacious members of the corporation to be at hand, or had already come, the holder of stock transferred it to irresponsible persons, or sold it to ignorant and innocent ones.
