It is not alleged that he does not obtain all that it was contemplated he should have when the contract was made.

The agents of the plaintiff represented that it had been or would be. This was obviously an expression of opinion only. According to his own case, the defendant was the purchaser of a scholarship. The plaintiff’s agents were vendors. The value of the thing sold and purchased was in debate. The agents said it would be worth as much as the amount promised before the collection of the notes; that it would become worth so much by subscriptions already made or to be obtained. That this is not enough to relieve a purchaser from his bargain, need not be argued. There is no relation of trust and confidence between a vendor and vendee. It is not every mistaken representation that avoids a bargain, much less a mistaken representation of value. A representation and a condition are not the same thing. Had the affidavit averred that the promise to pay was made contingent upon any condition, either that a sufficient sum had been or would be subscribed to pay the debts of the college, or even that the scholarship should prove worth its price, another question would be presented. But as it is, this averment sets out no defence.</p>
