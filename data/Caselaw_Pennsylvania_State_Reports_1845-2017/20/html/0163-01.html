The plaintiff contends that the White title has been long since divested by virtue of the statute of limitations — that, having color of title there has been an adverse possession under the Findley claim for more than 21 years, and that the owner of the whole survey has been ousted for that period. The warrants and surveys- in 1811, <em>though the surveys were not returned </em>(till 1817 and 1841), gave Findley a sufficient color of title to enable him and those claiming under him to avail themselves of the statute, if actual ouster is shown.</p>

Whether he occupied and cultivated the upper and lower tracts, must be determined by the jury. Residence is the most clear evidence of ouster. Cultivation without residence is evidence of the same fact, and may show adverse possession and ouster as well, though, perhaps, not so unequivocally as actual residence. Here the party had three small adjoining surveys. He resided on the middle survey, and as to that one, the defendant does not press his defence. The question of fact then is, did Findley, after the surveys in 1811, while living on the middle tract, <em>clear and cultivate </em>portions of the other two; and if so, was it for more' than 21 years before the sale to Baker, and was it kept up ?

The nonpayment of taxes by the owner of James White is a circumstance leading to the inference of ouster, because it is a kind of tacit admission of it. We can gather from the spirit of the law no reason why the Findley title should not be good under the statute as to the whole three adjoining surveys, if they were occupied together as one farm (although one or two of them may not liaye been actually cultivated for the <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>requisite period), by the same rule which would assuredly protect it if the land were in one survey. The question is of actual ouster. A constructive possession follows a warrant and survey, and, in case of conflict, the constructive possession of the elder title of course prevails. But the owner of the junior warrant and survey may, by taking actual, oust the constructive possession of the senior warrantee, and if he continues it for 21 years his title is good, although the disputed portion, or interference in the survey, may have remained woodland all the time. The owner of three small adjoining surveys interfering with other surveys, who cultivates <em>on but one or two of them, but occupies and uses the whole three as one farm, treating and using the woodland as others do theirs, </em>and pays the only taxes paid on the land he claims, commits as notorious and unequivocal an ouster, and takes a possession as visibly adverse as if he had but one survey.”</p>

On the middle one of these small surveys, Findley had his buildings and improvements, and resided.

They distinguish the case from Hole <em>v. </em>Rittenhouse. There, the land claimed was.more than can possibly be the subject of such acts as farmers and improvers ordinarily exercise over their adjacent woodlands; here, the quantity was less. There, such ownership was not exercised. Here, it was. In such questions as this there is no mysterious virtue in lines. White suffered himself to be ousted from his land by the entry of Findley into 200 acres of it. Of what moment is it that Findley run lines to divide the 200 acres into three parts, if he occupied the whole ? The exterior lines of his three surveys were the limits of his claim. The interior lines, made for his own accommodation, and themselves an assertion of ownership, signified nothing as to the disseissin and ouster of White. The open, notorious acts on the ground, for 21 years, were notice to White of the extent and hostility of Findley’s holding, and, having fled the field for so long a period, confessing himself disseised by nonpayment of taxes (Read <em>v. </em>Goodyear, 17 <em>Ser. </em>&amp; <em>R. 350; </em>McCall <em>v. </em>Neely, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%2070" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Watts 70">3 <em>Watts </em>70</a>), and not. yet, even, returning to assert his lost rights, it is.not for this defendant to assert and set them up against the payment of his bond.

When done under color of title, they are more significant and decisive than if done by a mere intruder. In a late case, Alden <em>v. </em>Grove, 6 <em>Harris </em>377, it was said, since the cases of Altemus <em>v. </em>Criswell and those which follow in its wake, it is vain to deny that the intruder’s use of the woodland, as woodland is ordinarily used, is, in the eye of the law, <em>actual possession </em>of it, as truly and effectually for the purposes of the statute of limitations as his cultivation of fields is actual possession of them. If Findley had cultivated fields on the two adjoining tracts for 21 years, nobody pretends that they would not have been an actual possession to give title. Rut, according to the adjudged cases, the acts performed by him were no less actual possession. The conclusion is obvious and inevitable.</p>
