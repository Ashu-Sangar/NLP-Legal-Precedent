'It is of course a consideration of some weight, that, besides our provincial existence with many laws and institutions peculiar to ourselves, we have existed as an independent state for three-quarters of a century without learning that such words have any technical meaning by our law, or are to be construed differently from words of common parlance.</p>

That it remains of, any force in England, after the reason of it has ceased, is not surprising ; for it is a common fate of institutions to outlive the causes which gave rise to them, and thus very often the form survives the principle which it was designed to express.</p>
    <p id="b277-7" data-blocks='[["BL_277.5",277,[239,1192,1167,600]]]'>It is acknowledged that the rule by which a trust is raised out of such words, was imported into the English from the Roman law. Its origin, therefore, in the Roman law, is a relevant subject of inquiry; for if we find it arising there, not from the ordinary meaning of the words, but under the constraint of circumstances which have no existence here, the force of the Roman rule will be much impaired, if not destroyed. If, under their law, words of common parlance acquired a technical value by reason of a peculiar institution, then that technical value depends upon circumstances and ceases with them, and the common meaning alone remains. To construe such words, after that, as technical, is, in .almost all eases, to pervert the true meaning of the words, unless other parts of the instrument clearly show that 'they are technically used.</p>

Hence, and by way of /compensation, he was not bound to pay any of the legacies bequeathed by the testator; but this matter was left by the law entirely to his discretion. It was of the essence of a Roman will that the. devisee should be universal successor to the property and debts of the decedent. He was in form and substance what we would call executor and sole deviseo and legatee, with the additional qualification that he (or they, for many might be joined) was bound personally for the debts, if he accented the devise.</p>

    <p id="b278-6" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[343,553,1157,512]]]'>Moreover, there were great and peculiar difficulties in making a valid will at all under the Roman law, owing to the excessive strictness and complexity of the formalities required; and hence it was usual to' add a codicil, in which the testator entreated his heir at law, if the will should not stand, to make the desired dispositions, or to hold the property for the benefit of the persons named in the codicil. Here, again, words of entreaty are much more appropriate than imperative words. Under the circumstances, they clearly proved an intention to impose a duty on the general devisee as far as was possible, and not merely to intrust him with a discretion. He intended a legacy; it was the law that made it discretionary in disregard even of imperative words.</p>

Hence arose an alteration of the law, and the praetors were required to enforce trusts that were created in this form. Under such circumstances the new rule was a proper one; for it enforced the very duty imposed by the testator in the best form in which he was allowed to express it. No doubt the law continued after the reason of it had ceased; but then it contravened the intention of the testator by enforcing, as a binding obligation, what had been intrusted to the discretion of the heir or devisee. These matters are fully illustrated in <em>Domat. </em>2, 3, 1; 1 <em>Spence’s Eq. Jurisd. </em>435; and in the <em>Corpus Juris Civ.

The power of devise existed 'among the Anglo-Saxons in its fullest extent, and hence we might expect to find no such trusts among them, and it is said that no Anglo-Saxon will has been found containing the appointment of an executor charged with trusts: 1 <em>Spence’s Eq. Jur. </em>23, quoting <em>Hinks’ Dissert. </em>37. Rut, after the Norman conquest, and under the strict principles of feuds, devises of lands were not allowed. Hence the frequent resort to conveyances in trust, in order to be able to make provision for younger children, and for other purposes. These trusts were at first of no binding obligation, but depended for their execution entirely upon the honor of the grantee, and it was therefore very natural and appropriate that words of recommendation, desire, entreaty, and confidence should be used. Dishonesty would, of course, often occasion enormous grievances arising out of breaches of such confidence. It was very easy then for an English Chancellor to bring <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>in the Roman law to correct such evils. It was really enforcing what was intended to be a trust, and changing the law to do it. It was equity stepping in to correct the deficiencies of common law institutions, and modifying them into accordance with the changing customs and circumstances of the people. The rule, thus properly introduced, has of course outlived the circumstances which gave it birth, and which alone ought to maintain it.</p>

He says, 13 <em>State R. </em>258, “it is plain that she was to use, not only the income of the personal estate, but the estate itself, as if she were the untrammelled owner of it. What other meaning can be given to the word ‘ absolutely <em>V </em>We may not strike it out, and if he meant not to give her a fight <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>to consume both principal and proceeds he knew not what he said.” And the order of reference to ascertain “the value of the surplus of the testator’s personal property unconsumed at Mrs. Pennock’s death,” was a consequence of that opinion. But it was not a legitimate consequence, as the cases last above referred to prove ; for if she might apply the principal to her own use, then there can be no trust, and the case ought to have been dismissed, not referred. How could there be a trust in the legal sense of that word ? No trust or contract that is uncertain is enforced by law; because the law would have to define it, or, in other words, create it, before enforcing it.</p>

An artificial rule like the one insisted on here, that is founded on no great principle of policy, and that sets aside, while it is professing to seek the will of the testator, must continually be contested and must be frequently invaded. And no one oan read the English decisions on this subject without suspecting that all important wills, wherein similar words are found, become the subjects of most expensive contests, and give rise to those family quarrels which are the worst and most bitter and distressing of all sorts of litigation.

What did he intend by those words of confidence ? Evidently to commit all the personal property to the discretion of his wife. He expected her to use it as she pleased, and to leave what should remain at her death “justly” among his children; but he enjoined nothing. Hi's will was to give her the power of disposal, because he' had confidence in her. He intended no interference with or guidance of her discretion; but trusted all to a mother’s heart. Yet this is the intention which the law is expected to guide. And, in order to enforce this demand, it is insisted that she had but a life estate in the personal property. But the testator excludes this construction, for he places the real éstate “for life” in con'trast with the personal estate “absolutely;” and contrasted expressions cannot be equivalent. And yet, without forcing this construction, this ease is at an end, unless it be insisted that the mother took no estate at all for herself; which is too absurd to be thought of. And as to the word “surplus,” it can have no other meaning than the one above given, and that given by Chief Justice Hibson in the opinion before referred to. The view here taken of the words of confidence is further confirmed by other parts of the will, where he, with “perfect confidence” and “full confidence,” intrusts his children to the kindness of their mother. Here, surely, he was intending no legal trust.</p>
