The persons thus appointed the building committee selected the site for a church, <em>and erected the-building. </em>Suit was then instituted against the defendants below to recover the $50 alleged to have been subscribed by Ellis Phipps. The defendants below contended that there was no promise which would bind the intestate during his life, or his representatives after his death; that there were not mutual prómises, and-, at most, the subscription was but a-promise of a gift, which could not take effect till the delivery of the thing given.</p>

Such associations have always, and especially since the Act of 1781, been recognised as having an associate and quasi corporate existence in law, with power to hold land and build appropriate houses, and of course with power to acquire rights by contract, and to vindicate them. And if the English common law forms are insufficient for such cases, we admit the infusion into our law of the plain equity principle that allows a committee of voluntary societies to sue and be sued as representatives of the whole: 1 <em>Bro. C. C. </em>101; 13 <em>Ves. </em>544; <em>Story’s Eq. Pl. </em>§ 116. There is, therefore, no difficulty about sustaining this action, if it has a contract to rest upon. In the case of Chambers <em>v. </em>Calhoun, 6 <em>Harris </em>13, the congregation had been already formed, and the contract of subscription was for the purpose of erecting a new church, and it contained a promise to pay to the building committee, which had not then been appointed, and, when appointed, the promissor was one of them; yet the action against him in the name of his fellows, on behalf of the congregation, was sustained.</p>

An engagement to subscribe for the benefit of an association is necessarily a mere proposal, and therefore revocable, until the association is formed. It is a promise of each for the benefit of the associate whole, and remains unattached and incomplete until the association is complete. Until then there is no one tojaccept the proposal, and, in this case, it was withdrawn by thejLeafrh of the subscriber before its acceptance.
