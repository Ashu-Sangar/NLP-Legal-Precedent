An executor was charged with making claim against the estate of the testator on a promissory note, which, it was alleged, had been forged, and his removal by the Orphans’ Court was asked for for mismanagement of the estate under his charge. An issue was sent into the Common Pleas to try the genuineness of the note, which issue resulted in a verdict for the executor, and the Orphans’ Court afterwards dismissed the citation. Subsequently, the executor, on his own petition, was discharged. Appeal was, however, after-wards taken from the decree dismissing the citation.</p>

Thomas B. and Aaron Hallowell alleged that this note was a forgery. Their petition was presented to the Orphans’ Court for a citation against George, to show cause why he should not he dismissed from the trust as executor. The citation was awarded on 20th August, 1849. In the petition it was alleged that George had possessed himself of a considerable portion of the personal estate of the testator, especially of a bond for $1000, the payment of which he was seeking to enforce, and that he had attempted to misapply the assets of the estate.

The appellee’s answer denied all the charges against him, and asserted the note to be genuine. The Orphans’ Court directed an issue to the Common Pleas to try this question of fact, and it was determined by the jury in favor of the appellee. The petition was dismissed. Soon afterwards the appellee was discharged from his trust as executor upon his own petition; but this appeal from the decree of the Court dismissing the first petition, was taken nevertheless.</p>

Even if we could believe what we cannot, that the Court was wrong in refusing to remove him on the adversary proceeding, we could not reverse that decree without involving ourselves in a manifest absurdity.

The rule thus established was firmly based on precedent, and commended itself besides to every one’s judgment. Delay in such proceedings is an intolerable <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>grievance; and a writ of error could serve no other purpose. It is the duty of the Orphans’ Court, when the result of the trial in the Common Pleas is sent to them, to decide in accordance with the verdict, if they are so far satisfied of its truth and justice that the judges can conscientiously adopt the decision of the jury as their own. But if, on examining the evidence (which ought regularly to be certified to the Orphans’ Court along with the verdict), they should be dissatisfied with the result, they may either order a new issue, or decree according to their own convictions, without regarding the opinion of the jury.</p>
    <p id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.4",220,[297,850,1172,761]]]'>An appeal from the final decree of the Orphans’ Court brings the whole subject before us for review; and, as the Orphans’ Court had power to decide with or against the Common Pleas, so have we, when the case comes into this Court, if, in our opinion, justice requires us to do so. This answers the only proper purpose for which a writ of error can be taken. It is very true that we would not be at liberty to reverse the Orphans’ Court, because the Common Pleas may have admitted evidence which ought to have been rejected, or rejected evidence which ought to have been admitted, if, on the whole case, we believe, the decree to be right. Bills of exceptions on sharp points of law are out of place in a proceeding intended merely to inform the conscience of the Court in a matter of fact. No one ever thought of bringing up the decision of an auditor immediately to this Court by a writ of error, directed to him over the head of the Orphans’ Court; and yet the necessity and propriety of it can be seen as easily as we can discern the reason for issuing one to the Common Pleas in a case like this.</p>
    <p id="b220-7" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[296,1623,1167,472]]]'>These remarks may seem beside the subject, since the act of 10th April, 1848, has given a writ of error in the case of a feigned issue by the Orphans’ Court. But my object is to furnish a reason for the opinion of this Court, that the statute, though it permits a new mode of correcting the errors of such a proceeding, does not abolish the old one; and to indicate what are the rules which will govern us on appeals. The Legislature could not have forbidden us to examine the proceedings in a feigned issue without taking away the right of appeal altogether. ' When we review the decree we must look at the whole ease, and the trial of the facts is a part of the case. See 4 <em>Barr </em>469.</p>

Those who desire to vex, harass, and delay their opponents will probably take both; and those who only wish for justice will be content, like the appellants in this case, to have the'whole subject investigated at once.</p>

But if .this record had been full of the most glaring errors, the appellee has corrected them all himself, by voluntarily doing what it was the whole object of the appellants to compel him to do. Indeed, we are asked to say that he <em>must </em>do that which he <em>has </em>done.</p>
