About June, 1850, he removed with his family to Greensburg, Westmoreland county, where he rented a house till the 1st April, 1851. On the 3d January, 1851, he rented another house in Greensburg, for the term of one year, from the 1st April, 1851. He took possession of it, and paid the rent in advance till 1st October, 1851. During portions of this time, he was engaged in erecting buildings in Westmoreland, Washington, and Greene counties, Pennsylvania. During the same time, he had a contract on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, in Maryland. It was not disputed that he was a resident of Greensburg from June, 1850, till 1st April, 1851. But it was alleged, that about the 15th April, 1851, he broke up housekeeping ; that his wife and family went to Harrisburg to reside with her father, and that he had then gained a residence in Maryland, and never returned to Pennsylvania to reside.</p>

That he did not get possession till about the first of September. The agreement, by which he was to have possession, was made with Bryan. Bryan had possession of one room until after the middle of September. His goods were in the room. The goods were finally boxed up and taken away. The direction on some of the boxes was to Harrisburg. His impression was that Mrs. Bryan remained until the last of August or 1st of September.</p>

But we think when one has a known residence, when he has a house provided for his family, and has therein his household goods, to gain a counter residence, or to lose his residence of origin, it must appear from the circumstances that his removing out of the Commonwealth was with a view of remaining and obtaining a residence. Here he was engaged <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>as a contractor on a railroad, an employment necessarily temporary, and, so far as locality was concerned, of a shifting nature.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b148-6" data-blocks='[["BL_148.4",148,[347,484,1167,1161]]]'>In some respects, this case is not unlike Nailor <em>v. </em>French, 4 <em>Teates </em>241; but it differs in this important particular; French had a wife and children living in Philadelphia, but it appears he had been separated from them five or six years before he left; so that the residence of his family was wholly apart from him, and could not determine his domicil. But here the defendant had rented a house and lot, and paid the rent a half-year in advance; his household goods had actually been moved into the house; and we might infer from the evidence, that if not actually occupied from the 1st to the 15th of April, when Mrs. Bryan left for Harrisburg, it was in every respect suitable to be occupied. It is .not customary to rent a house and lot for a whole year, merely for the purpose of stowing away goods.. This, in the opinion of the Court, clearly evinces an intention of making Greens-burg a place of residence. In Lazarus Barnett’s case, 1 <em>Pallas </em>152, Shippen, Prest., said, if <em>‘ </em>a man introduces his family here, takes a house, engages in trade, contracts debts, and after some time runs away, with design to defraud his creditors, he ought surely to be considered such an inhabitant as not to be an object of the foreign attachment, but of the domestic one.’ However, if he would withdraw himself from the state with the intention of gaining a residence elsewhere, he would be considered subject to a foreign attachment the moment he left the confines of the state. No certain rule has been established fixing what circumstances will create a new residence within the Commonwealth. But we are satisfied that what is proven here shows that he was a resident of Pennsylvania at the date'of issuing this attachment.</p>

    <p id="b149-9" data-blocks='[["BL_149.11",149,[201,836,1168,517]]]'>Foreign attachment is a remedy against debtors that are absent and non-resident; while domestic attachment is a remedy against resident debtors absenting or concealing themselves. Absence or its equivalent gives the remedy by attachment of one kind or the other. Residence and non-residence are the contrasted elements in the definitions of the two kinds of attachment. And the character of the remedies is consistent with this distinction; for the absconding debtor is treated as though he had committed an act pf bankruptcy, and the domestic attachment sequesters his goods for the benefit of all his creditors; whereas the non-resident debtor is treated as having merely broken hiá contract, and his goods are attached to enforce his appearance.</p>
    <p id="b149-10" data-blocks='[["BL_149.12",149,[202,1353,1168,604]]]'>This was clearly a case, not of a non-resident and absent, but of a resident and absconding debtor.; and therefore it was right to dissolve the foreign attachment. His absconding is one of the very acts that give the right to the domestic attachment. He was still a resident, within the meaning.of the law, if the act of absconding was the only breach of his resident character; and up to that time no intention of changing his residence appears. It makes no difference that during some time before his absconding he was not within the reach of process, because of his absence in performing a job of work. This was no disruption of his resident relation. It often happens that the ordinary process of the law is delayed by the temporary and innocent absence of resident debtors; but such absence does not subject them to the extraordinary remedy by attachment.</p>
