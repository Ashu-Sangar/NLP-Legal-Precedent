The grantees received possession.</p>

Afterwards Risley and others, being so seised of the lot subject to the ground-rent, conveyed it, and the title became afterwards vested in James S. Pringle, his heirs and assigns. Pringle, on the 13th June, 1842, conveyed the lot, subject to the rent, to Enoch Taylor. It was alleged in the <em>narr., </em>that the conveyance to Taylor was in trust for, and for the sole use and benefit of, PRTcinton, the defendant. Afterwards, viz., on the 1st July, 1842, $345.79 of the rent became due, for which this action was brought.</p>

At this time, the legal title to the lot was in Taylor. The plaintiffs brought suit against the original covenantors, and obtained judgment, under which they afterwards sold the land at sheriff’s sale, subject to the ground-rent, for a sum less than sufficient to pay the costs. The plaintiffs then brought suit against Huston on <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>his guarantee, and he paid the money. He paid it without the consent or knowledge of Taylor or Elkinton. Upwards of <em>seven </em>years after the payment by Huston, the present suit by Newman and others, for the use of Huston, was brought against Elkinton, on the ground that he was the real owner of the lot, though the legal title to it was in Taylor, and evidence was given to that effect. An agreement in writing under seal, between Pringle and Elkinton, for an exchange of real estate, was given in evidence, by the terms of which the lot hereinbefore referred to was to be conveyed by Pringle to Elkinton, <em>or his order.</em>

When Huston assigned the ground-rent to the legal plaintiff, he guarantied its payment. When, therefore, he paid it himself, on the defendant’s default, he performed, not the defendant’s duty, <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>but his own. Eor the defendant to set up this fact in his defence, is to claim the very merits which belong to Dr. Huston, and which entitle him to present this demand. It is claiming subrogation to his merits in order to deprive him of his rights. In such a case no question of priority between the equitable plaintiff and the legal defendant arises. It is like the case of an insurance on goods in the hands of a carrier. If they be lost by the fault of the carrier, the insurer pays the damage, and is then substituted to the rights of the owner against the carrier, and uses the owner’s name as plaintiff in the action. It comes within the common principle of subrogation, that where a creditor has two securities for his debt, and resorts to the secondary one, the Court will aid the secondary fund by transferring to the claimants upon it the remedies against the fund that was primarily liable.</p>
