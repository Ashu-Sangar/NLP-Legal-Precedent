She, however, made a codicil, dated 5th May, 1841, as it would seem, after her marriage; and if she had legal capacity then to do so, that would be a republication of her <em>former </em>will, and make both one valid instrument. But by the Act of 1833 she had no such capacity, if she was then a married woman, unless a power for such purpose was legally created for her so to dispose of her estate. The provision in her favor is, ‘that a married-woman may, under a power legally created for the purpose, dispose of her real or personal estate by will, or appointment in nature of a will; and that any married woman may, with the assent or license of her husband, dispose of her personal estate by will.’ Consequently, the jury will look to the testimony for the facts on this point, to see whether a power legally created for her, for such purpose, is shown; or whether she made her codicil by the assent or license of her husband, as respects her personal estate. The power, however, which is sufficient to dispose of her real and personal estate by will, or appointment in the nature of a will, must be an express one, and cannot be implied from a general right at the time, by a marriage contract, or otherwise, to control or alien her property. It must be an express power to dispose of it by will or appointment. And as it regards her personal estate, <em>the assent or license of her husband must not be general to make a will, but the will in question. </em>So the Court instructs the jury on the Act of 1833.</p>

That act, however, has no such retrospect. It is specially restricted to property owned by or belonging to <em>single women </em>— such shall continue to be theirs as fully after their marriage as before; and next, to such as shall accrue to a married woman during coverture. Both provisions are plainly prospective from the date of the statute; and, therefore, if the jury find the property involved to have belonged to the testatrix before- the date of said Act, or not to have accrued to her during her coverture, after the date of said Act, none of its provisions will sustain these papers as valid, either as will or codicil.</p>

    <p id="b211-9" data-blocks='[["BL_211.11",211,[200,982,1172,131]]]'>1. The original will, which was made in 1833, is to be taken as revoked by her subsequent marriage (which took place in 1834), agreeably to sec. 16 of the general act relating to wills.</p>
    <p id="b211-10" data-blocks='[["BL_211.12",211,[202,1112,1171,129]]]'>2. The codicil of 1841 was a republication of the will, and revived its legal force, if she had authority to dispose of her property by last will and testament at that time.</p>
    <p id="b211-11" data-blocks='[["BL_211.13",211,[201,1240,1172,213]]]'>3. She had no such authority by the act of 1848, because it was not then passed, and her right to make a will is to be determined by the law as it stood then, and not by the statutes in force at the time of her death. This is decided in Mullen <em>v. </em>McKelvy, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20W.%20399" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 W. 399">5 <em>W. </em>399</a>; see also <em>Dwarris on Stat. </em>685.</p>
    <p id="b211-12" data-blocks='[["BL_211.14",211,[196,1455,1174,172]]]'>4. We must therefore fall back on the act of 1833, the only one which was in force at the date of the will; and this act, in sec. 3, provides that a married woman may, by the assent or license of her husband, dispose of her personal estate by will.</p>
    <p id="b211-13" data-blocks='[["BL_211.15",211,[197,1628,1174,172]]]'>5. The evidence proved the consent of the husband that the wife might do as she pleased with the rest of her property if he got $1000. This is no more than a mere general license to make a will, even if it amounts to that.</p>
    <p id="b211-14" data-blocks='[["BL_211.16",211,[194,1800,1175,211]]]'>6. But a general license to make a will is not sufficient. It must be a special authority to make the particular will in question. This we consider the natural meaning of the act, and is in accordance with the construction given to similar statutes elsewhere <em>Lovelass on Wills </em>266; 2 <em>East </em>552; 15 <em>Vesey </em>139.</p>
    <p id="b211-15" data-blocks='[["BL_211.17",211,[193,2012,1175,123]]]'>7. It follows that this will is void for want of power to make it; that there is no error in the record; and that the judgment is to. be affirmed.</p>
