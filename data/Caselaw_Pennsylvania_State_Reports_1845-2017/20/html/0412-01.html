By the Act of 1705, if the plaintiff proved that goods of the debtor came to the hands of the garnishee “ <em>at any time after” </em>service of the writ, he .was entitled to recover. By Act of 1789 the garnishee was required to answer not only touching goods in his hands at the time of the service of the writ, but in relation to those which came to his hands <em>“at any other time.” </em>The Act of 13th June, 1836, embraces the substance of these provisions. In 1811 it was decided upon the construction of the .statutes of Pennsylvania, by the Circuit Court of the United States, that the attachment bound goods or money which came to the hands of the garnishee <em>after the service of the writ: </em>Taylor <em>v. </em>Gardner, <em>Sergeant on Attach. </em>103. And in Silverwood <em>v. </em>Bellas, <a href="/watts/8/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Watts 420" data-case-ids="1848392" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0420-01">8 <em>Watts </em>420</a>, the same doctrine was distinctly affirmed by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania so as to bind by the. attachment a sum of money which' had been placed by an attorney in the hands of the garnishee, as a mere messenger, to convey to the debtor, <em>three years after the service of the writ of attachment. This </em>fully settles the practice, on this point, in foreign attachments. The Act of 16th June, 1836, which authorizes the attachment of debts or deposits of money in execution, expressly declares that they may be attached and levied in satisfaction of the plaintiff’s judgment <em>in the manner allowed in the case of a foreign attachment.” </em>The rule is, therefore, the same in both forms of proceeding. It is made so by express enactment, and there is no reason why the Courts should desire to introduce a new rule for attachments under the Act of 1836, after the profession and the people have become familiar with, and the legislature has adopted the practice in foreign attachments.</p>
