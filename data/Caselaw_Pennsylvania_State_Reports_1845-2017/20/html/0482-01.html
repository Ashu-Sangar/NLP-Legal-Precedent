    <p class="summary" id="b484-13" data-blocks='[["BL_484.9",484,[362,1750,1160,559]]]'>This was an action of <em>assumpsit </em>by John Maulé to the use of Felton Bartle <em>v. </em>O. Ashmead, administrator of the estate of Rebecca Peiffer, deceased. A verbal lease of a piece of land was made in April, 1845, by Rebecca Peiffer to John Maulé, for five years, to run from the 1st of April, 1845, at a rent of <em>$100 </em>for the first year, and $150 for each of the other four years. In pursuance of the lease Maulé took possession in the spring of 1845. He continued in possession for about ten months, and then transferred his lease to Felton Bartle, for $313, including the stock then on hand. Bartle took possession and continued therein for about three years. It was alleged that he was a good farmer, kept stock, and put on the land a good deal of manure; and thus considerably increased the value of the land.</p>

An order of sale was granted, and on the 8th September, 1847, the land was sold, and the sale was confirmed on 14th September, 1847. A deed was executed by her to Bunting, the purchaser, dated 9th October, 1847, which did not contain any reservation in favor of Maulé. Bunting conveyed to Steinmetz, and a notice by him, dated 18th December, 1847, was served on Bartle to quit the premises on or before the 1st April following, or pay at the rate of $300 per year, &amp;e. Possession of the land was got by Steinmetz on the 1st April, 1845.</p>
