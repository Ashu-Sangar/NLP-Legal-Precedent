The question then is, not may parol evidence be received to contradict the written agreement; but may it be received to repel an implication of a condition usually raised by the law in such cases, and which is itself, in this instance, contrary to the words as written ?</p>
    <p id="b179-9" data-blocks='[["BL_179.7",179,[214,1925,1173,518]],["BL_180.1",180,[325,405,1162,176]]]'>A written contract creates a specified relation between the parties <em>; </em>and when the duties of that relation are not fully defined in the contract, the law defines them according to the circumstances.. In a carrier case, it defines the duty, in part, by implying the exception against inevitable accident. But here the maxim applies,, <em>conventio vincit legem. </em>The law does not imply the exemption,, where the circumstances show that the parties intended that it should not be implied; and these circumstances may be shown by parol evidence. This is the very principle decided in the case of Barclay <em>v. </em>Weaver, 7 Harris, 396, argued about the same time-with this; and it was there applied in the same way when it was, decided that parol evidence may be given to show that an endorser <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>of a promissory note agreed to be liable without the usual demand and notice required by law. The Court was therefore in error in rejecting this evidence on such grounds: see also <em>Abbott on Shipping </em>130; <em><a href="/wend/14/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="14 Wend. 215" data-case-ids="2017110" data-case-paths="/wend/14/0215-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/wend/14/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="14 Wend. 215" data-case-ids="2017110" data-case-paths="/wend/14/0215-01">320</a>; <em>Angell on Carriers, </em>sec. 222.</p>
    <p id="b180-6" data-blocks='[["BL_180.4",180,[325,577,1167,390]]]'>But the whole evidence proposed to be given is set out in the bill of exceptions; and it is argued that, if admitted, it is insufficient to prove the allegation, because the circulars contain an offer to carry and insure at one price, and these goods are contracted to be delivered at another and less price; and this argument would prevail, if the circulars were the only evidence. But they are not. There were oral testimony and advertisements besides; and we cannot say that, from all taken together, the inference of an agreement to insure would be illegitimate.</p>
    <p id="b180-7" data-blocks='[["BL_180.5",180,[326,967,1164,288]]]'>Where a man advertises favorable terms of business as a means of gaining customers, it is proper to presume that his customers have been induced by them, or that they have been repeated to them; and therefore it is not necessary that the plaintiff should prove that the advertisements came to his knowledge before delivering his goods to the defendants to be carried. The judgment as to these counts must be reversed.</p>
