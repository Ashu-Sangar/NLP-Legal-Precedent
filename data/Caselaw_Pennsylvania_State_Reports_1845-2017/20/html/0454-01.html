When the loans were made, the stocks deposited were, as I am informed, believed by both parties to be fully sufficient to secure the repayment of the amounts loaned.

J., was as follows: — “ Upon the papers filed it is by no means an inference either of law or fact that Messrs. Denison &amp; Co. were the agents <em>of the plaintiff. </em>Certain stocks and securities were deposited in their hands by the defendants, as securities for the holders of a certain loan contracted by them. The fact is stated upon the face of the instrument sued upon, and the plaintiff took it, undoubtedly, with the knowledge that there' was a collateral in the hands of the trustees. It might be urged, indeed, with great plausibility that Denison <em>k </em>Co. were the agents of the defendants, if <em>they </em>were the agents of either party. They were nominated by the bank, but in truth they are to be considered as the holders, by assignment, from the bank, for the benefit and security of both parties. It is <em>not the </em>case then of collaterals, placed in the hands of the creditors, to which case only do the cases of Lyon <em>v. </em>Huntingdon Bank, 12 <em>Bar. ¿y R. </em>67, and Spalding <em>v. </em>Bank of Susquehanna county, 9 <em>Barr </em>29, apply. There may be reasons for holding that the creditor in such case shall produce or account for such collaterals. Then if the defendants pay the plaintiffs’ claim, they have a right to call on the trustees to account. If the trustees have actually paid anything on account <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>to the plaintiff, for which credit has not been given, it is incumbent on the defendants to allege and prove it. The plaintiff cannot begin by proving a negative, otherwise than by calling the trustees themselves as witnesses; whereas, when the creditor himself is the holder of the collateral, he can easily produce it if he is still the holder. In the case before us, then, the onus is on the defendant, and the facts presented in his affidavit, do not, in our opinion, amount to any defence. Rule made absolute.”</p>

The notes were issued, and this suit is brought on one of them.</p>

When he converts them to his own use, as he is always presumed to have done when he refuses, without reason, to furnish an account Of them, he is chargeable with their full value (9 <em>Barr </em>28). But this does not touch the present case. The <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>question here is, whether the creditor is required to account in an action on the main security for collaterals which were never in hi3 hands or under his dominion, which therefore could not have been lost by his default, and from which he never did in fact realize anything. It is not possible to doubt that under these circumstances, he may recover against the defendant just as if the transaction with Denison <em>&amp; </em>Co. had never been. Even where collateral securities are placed in the custody of the creditor if he has been guilty of no negligence, has realized nothing from them, and has never withheld information concerning them when requested to furnish it, he is entitled to judgment against the principal debtor. This was decided very lately in Lord <em>v. </em>The Ocean Bank, 8 <em>Harris </em>384. <em>A fortiori </em>there may be such a recovery when they are placed by the debtor in the hands of a third person who is a trustee appointed by himself.</p>

The notes are a promise by the bank to pay a certain sum of money at a certain time and place. The promise has been broken; a right of action has accrued; and it cannot be defeated by an arrangement between the debtor and her London bankers which resulted in no benefit to the creditor.</p>
