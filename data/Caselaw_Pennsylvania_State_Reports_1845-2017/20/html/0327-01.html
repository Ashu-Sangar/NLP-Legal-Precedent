An order, regulation, or by-law of the company to exclude all but farmers from the market, and to exclude even them for every purpose except that of selling the hay and straw grown by themselves, was not illegal, but was on the contrary required by the general scope and spirit of the charter. The plaintiff was excluded as a dealer; so. says one of his own witnesses, and such are the terms of the written notice served on him and produced by himself as a part of his case. lie has proved very clearly that he <a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>was a dealer as well as a producer.
