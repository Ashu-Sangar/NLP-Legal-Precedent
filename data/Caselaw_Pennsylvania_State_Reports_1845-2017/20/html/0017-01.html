If it were then <em>personal </em>estate, her husband, James Holland, was entitled, on her death, to her share of the money, and it was liable to disposition under his will.</p>

Not being taken, an order of sale was issued, and on 20th February, 1826, James Holland, the administrator, made return that he had sold the premises for $2071, two-thirds of the purchase-money to be paid when the deed was made, and the remaining third at the death of the widow of the deceased — the interest thereof to be paid to her in the mean time.

In the former, where payment of debts, or partition, and not conversion, is the object, the transmutation is but an unavoidable result of the proceeding, and takes place only when the estate is completely vested in the vendee and the purchase-money paid or secured. In proceedings in the Orphans’ Court for the partition of real estate, the confirmation of a report of sale, stating that two-thirds of the purchase-money were to be paid <em>when the deed was made, </em>and the remaining sum at the death of the widow of <em>the </em>intestate, is not a conversion of the real estate into personalty until the conditions of sale are complied with, so far at least as to entitle the purchaser to the delivery of the deed: 3 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>314; 9 <em>Id. </em>147. This is the general rule, and it is not the policy of the law to establish exceptions founded upon the varying phraseology in the legislation on the subject, where there is no substantial diversity. Distinctions and exceptions, where there are no clear and marked grounds for them, tend only to mislead the unwary. In this case, as the death of Elizabeth Holland occurred before the money was secured or paid or deed delivered, the conversion was not complete, and the proceeds of the sale belong to her heirs, and not to her husband’s personal representatives.</p>
