We presume everything against a plaintiff in'error whose paper-book is defective; and therefore we , take it for granted that the plea of bankruptcy was also traversed, and that both issues threw the burden of commencing the proof on the defendant. This presumption is strengthened by the course which the trial took. The discharge was objected to when it was offered in evidence, and its 'admission is assigned for error in this Court. Here, then, were two affirmative pleas, both denied by the plaintiff, and both to be supported by the defendant. Nothing can be plainer than the right of the defendant to open and close.

A party has no right to allege surprise on an alteration that is merely formal. The law means that he shall not, by a slip of pleading, be concluded as to the line of defence, and that he may, on or before the trial, plead any other defence which he claims to have. Nor can we say that the defence of bankruptcy is an exception. We are to inquire as to legal rights and defences, and the morality of the defence is excluded from our consideration. If there be a full legal defence, there can be no legal claim. It is a mistake to say that this plea is not to the merits; for, in this respect, the proper contrary of merits is form; and against a demand at law, a legal discharge from the claim is a matter of at least legal merit, and not at all of form.</p>
