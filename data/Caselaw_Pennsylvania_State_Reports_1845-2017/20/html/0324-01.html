Though the commissioners appointed on such an application have failed to report <em>as to the propriety </em>of the change, but have reported in favor of an alteration described, this Court will not reverse on account of such an exception applying merely to the form of the report, unless it appear to have been distinctly made in the Court below, and there ruled as a matter of law.</p>

Commissioners were appointed, who reported that in their opinion “ the prayer of the petitioners should be granted.” Exceptions to the report were filed on the 19th June, 1849. These proceedings were undetermined.</p>

It was alleged that in this last-mentioned proceeding, no order of Court was made directing notice <em>to North Manheim township, </em>and that there was no rule of Court in Schuylkill county upon the subject of notice in such eases, and no notice was, in fact, given to the supervisors, nor to the inhabitants of North Manheim township. That in January, 1850, the supervisors of the township of North Manheim were required to open a newly laid out and expensive road in the said territory immediately preceding the application to annex the territory in question to North Manheim township. ,</p>

The rule was granted, and on 27th July, 1852, the rule was discharged, “because the report was confirmed absolutely at December Sessions, 1849, by a special adjudication made at that time on the subject, and the present application was too late.”</p>

In the latter case, it is declared to be a principle of natural justice that notice should be given to the inhabitants. The objections here are, that no notice was given, and that, though the commissioners have expressed an opinion that the annexation prayed for would be an advantage to the inhabitants, they do not say it would be proper to make it.</p>

We do all that in us lies to discourage the attempts which dissatisfied parties make to be heard over again, after the commissioners and the Court of Quarter Sessions have decided against them on the merits.

At first, I was of opinion that the maxim “ <em>Omnia presumuntur rite esse acta” </em>would apply, and that we ought to take it for granted that there was notice.
