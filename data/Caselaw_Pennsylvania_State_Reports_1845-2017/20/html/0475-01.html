He expected to return to Philadelphia. He arrived at the Isthmus about the 17th January, 1851. About the 17th February, he was attacked with fever, from which he recovered to some extent, but had a relapse about the 1st of March, and died on the 4th. By his will, without date, but proved to have been made on the 3d March, the day preceding his death, all his estate, both real and personal, were briefly bequeathed to Norris, the plaintiff in the issue, and he was appointed executor.-</p>

By the use of remedies reaction was partially established that evening or night. Next morning, Monday, after the reaction had became partly established, he came to his senses and conversed. The witness had but faint hopes of his recovery. <em>The witness </em>then proposed to Norris to have a conversation with Dr. Reeve about his worldly affairs. It was had in the presence of the witness and of several others. Norris asked the Doctor if he wished to make a will; and the latter said “ Certainly.” And in reply to a question by Norris, as to whom he wished to leave his property, he answered, “ to you.” That the question as to whom he would bequeath his property, was repeated three times; that the will was drawn up by Norris and read to Dr. Reeve, in the presence of the witness and others, and the Doctor signed it.</p>

It was alleged that he was not of sound mind, and, as one circumstance, it was proved that he had sisters at home with whom he was on such terms of affection that he would not be likely to leave them without a provision, if he had understood what he was doing; and to strengthen the force of this fact, evidence was offered and admitted, that before -he left Philadelphia, he declared that all he had should go to them at his death.

How can this be proved except by his acts and declarations ? There may be cases where such declarations would amount to very little, as where they express an intention in favor of persons not at all or very remotely connected with the testator, and the will gives the property to an intimate friend. But it might also happen that evidence of this kind would carry irresistible conviction with it. For instance, suppose the testator to have a wife and children for whose sake he has labored industriously all his life, declaring his purpose to leave them all his fortune down to the moment when the delirium of a fatal illness clouds his understanding or fills it with delusions, and then for the first time, and without any assignable reason, he expresses his intention to disinherit the objects of his natural love, and give his property to one whom he has never seen before. I do not say that this is a case like the one last supposed. But the testator’s declarations, considered with reference to the other facts, were strong and pertinent evidence, not only admissible, but entitled to great weight with the jury.</p>
