Isaac Lobb, the elder, devised the same tract to his son Isaac Lobb, the younger, who held it till his death, which happened in 1843; and the plaintiff holds a life estate in the same land, and is now in possession. Thus we have a title in the plaintiff, derived from former owners as far back as the year 1770.</p>

Thus a title in the defendant is traced from the year 1773, through former owners down to the present occupier.”</p>

The private roád, a part of which is now in dispute, ran through the three tracts, from a public road, skirting the southern border of the lower Garrett tract, to a public road skirting the northern side of the upper Garrett tract. The plaintiff, being in the possession of the Lobb premises, claims the right of using that part of this private road which runs through the upper Garrett tract, and it is this supposed right which is now-interrupted.</p>

Two alterations at different times have been made in the location of the road: one in the year 1800, at the upper termination of the road, on the land held by Thomas Garrett; and one about 1807, at the crossing of the line between Thomas Garrett and Isaac Lobb, a part of which change was on the ground of each of the owners of the premises, and could not therefore have been made without the consent of both.'

The jury will say, from the whole case, what was the origin of this road, and to whose convenience it had reference.

But the enjoyment, without interruption, for more than 21 years, as in this case, is evidence of a character so strong of the existence of a right, that it leads to the legal conclusion of an adverse enjoyment, and the jury should not suffer themselves to infer mistake, favor, or license, upon small and trifling circumstances.

So a license to use the road for a certain defined period,- and the enjoyment of it under such license, will give no right after the expiration of the time. But where one uses an easement whenever he sees fit, without asking leave, and without objection, it is adverse, and an uninterrupted adverse enjoyment for twenty-one years is a title which cannot be after-wards disputed. Such enjoyment, without evidence to explain how it began, is presumed to have been in pursuance of a full and <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>unqualified grant.

The slightest examination will show that more could not. fairly have been expected. The foundation of the presumption <em>was </em>immaterial.

If the inference of the counsel was granted to be true, -what difference did it make whether or not the Court agreed with him in the steps by which he reached it ?
