The road, the motive-power, engine, tank, and appurtenances thereto, belonged to the State of Pennsylvania. The engineers and firemen employed, were appointed by or under the .authority of the Canal Commissioners, and each train was accompanied by an officer styled “ State Agent,” appointed in the same way, one of whose duties it was to collect for the state the tolls charged on each passenger. On the part of the defendants in the suit, it was said that the control of the speed of the cars, stoppages, &amp;c., was in the state agent. It was, however, testified by the conductor of the accommodation train, who was the agent of the defendants, that when he wanted to stop he notified the state agent, and that it was the duty of such agent to stop when he (the conductor) requested him, except- at an unusual stopping-place.</p>

On the day of the accident the accommodation train reached Downington <em>after its usual time. </em>At that place the plaintiff, a child of 11 or 12 years of age, with her father and brother, entered the car as passengers. The train left without waiting the arrival of the mail train, and passed Paoli, where there was a stopping-place ánd a turnout. About two miles below Paoli, where a curve in the road existed, from some cause not certainly known, perhaps from the spreading of the rails, the two front wheels of the tender or tank of the engine got off the track. The speed was slackened, and the conductor testified that he told the engineer to go ahead, and that he, the conductor, immediately ran back to give notice to the mail train, which he supposed might be approaching. The signal given was not observed sufficiently soon, and a collision took place, by which the plaintiff was injured.</p>

That the father made some difficulty and refused to pay for the girl — he said he was in an inferior car — I told him that I would prefer his going into the forward car. Nothing further passéd between them till the collision. He said that some time before the accident, the accommodation train.had been going at the rate of 25 miles per 'hour; at the time the tender got off the track, the speed was about 15 miles, and was afterwards reduced to about <em>from </em>8 to 10 miles.

He obtained the right to carry passengers on this road, and the use of the state’s motive-power and agents, by a contract with the state, and then he contracted with the plaintiff. Had his contract with the plaintiff been drawn out into form it would have recited, as it necessarily implies, a previous arrangement with the state authorities for the use of their road, their engines, and their agents. As between him and the passenger, these means of transportation become his. <em>Pro hao vice </em>the locomotive and the engineer are his engine and engineer, and logically, as well as on the principles of many adjudged cases, he is responsible for their conduct. If in borrowing these means of transportation he has not stipulated for supreme control in himself, or for indemnity against damages, that is his own concern. He holds himself out to the world as furnished with such means of transportation, and invites the confidence of the public in his ability to carry safely. The passenger looks only to him.

Bostwick <em>v. </em>Champion, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wend.%20571" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="11 Wend. 571">11 <em>Wend. </em>571</a>, and <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Wend.%20175" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="18 Wend. 175">18 <em>Wend. </em>175</a>; Weed <em>v. </em>The Schenectady and Saratoga Railroad Co., <a href="/citations/?q=19%20Wend.%20534" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="19 Wend. 534">19 <em>Wend. </em>534</a>. The state as well as the carrier is paid for each passenger transported on the Columbia Eailroad, which shows their community of interest ; and if there be a common liability, that of the state cannot be enforced by action, and this circumstance does not <em>diminish </em>that of the carrier. Because they, have a common interest, however, and share the profits of transportation, it is apparent that in holding the party before us to answer for the negligence of the state’s agents, we do not punish one man for the misfeasance of another’s servants. We do no more than apply the principles of law to the relations which the parties have established by their voluntary contracts.</p>
