That <em>in February, </em>1850, while the note on which suit is brought was in the possession of Patterson, he, Patterson, became insolvent, and in failing circumstances; that he communicated the facts of his insolvency and failing circumstances, and his inability to go on with his business, to Schober, one of the plaintiffs; and that at the time he communicated that fact, he transferred this note, by actual delivery, to him, Schober, with the intention of preferring the plaintiffs over the other creditors of him, the said Patterson; and that this intention was known to Schober at the time the note was so delivered : Mott and Schober then being responsible for the payment of large sums of money for the said Patterson.

Ten years afterwards this rule was repudiated by the same Court which established it (Jordaine <em>v. </em>Lashbrooke, 7 <em>Term Rep. </em>600). In New York it was adopted in Winton <em>v. </em>Saddler (3 <em>Johns.

But several of the other states have received the doctrine in a modified shape, and maintained it steadily; for instance, Massachusetts, Maine, and New Hampshire. It has received the express endorsement of the Supreme Court of the. United States, in the Bank <em>v. </em>Dunn (<a href="/us/31/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="6 Pet. 51" data-case-ids="1439669" data-case-paths="/us/31/0051-01">6 <em>Peters </em>51</a>), and in the United States <em>v. </em>Leffler (<a href="/citations/?q=11%20Pet.%2095" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="11 Pet. 95">11 <em>Peters </em>95</a>).

Since the last-mentioned case, which was decided in 1829, the question does not seem to have been considered an open one (Gest <em>v. </em>Espy, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20268" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="2 Watts 268">2 <em>Watts </em>268</a>; Parke <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>289; Gilpin <em>v. </em>Howell, 5 <em>Barr </em>51; Bank <em>v. </em>Fordyce, 9 <em>Barr </em>276; Wilt <em>v. </em>Snyder, 5 <em>Harris </em>77).</p>
    <p id="b474-6" data-blocks='[["BL_474.4",474,[324,692,1164,772]]]'>It must be remembered that the rule, as understood in this state, is confined strictly to negotiable instruments, and does not apply even to them unless they have been actually negotiated, and that in the regular course of business, previous to their maturity (5 <em>Harris </em>77). The note before us appears on its face to have been so negotiated, and the offer is to prove that it was not by a witness whose name is on the back of it, and then to establish by the same witness certain facts which made it worthless at the time he transferred it to the plaintiff. But he cannot be received for that purpose. The transaction, as it stands, presents an apparently well founded objection to his competency, which he cannot remove by his own oath. If he is <em>primd facie </em>within the rule that forbids him to invalidate an instrument which he has passed to an innocent holder, he cannot swear himself out of it by testifying that the holder is <em>not </em>innocent. If evidence of any irregularity in the transfer had been given <em>aliunde, </em>then the way would have been open to prove the other facts by an endorser of the instrument as .well as by another.</p>

The force of Judge Huston’s dissenting opinion in Griffith <em>v. </em>Reford is also felt, and the strong attack upon the whole doctrine contained in Mr. Hare’s note to Bent <em>v. </em>Baker (2 <em>Smith’s Lead. C. </em>57), is fully appreciated. But how are we to set ourselves against an unbroken current of decisions which have lasted for half a century, and which have been concurred in generally by all the judges without a murmur of dissent? The authority of our predecessors ever since the revolution, constantly repeated, at intervals of five or six years, is not very easily set aside, even though the rule it establishes was not, in our opinion, quite so well founded in pi'inciple, convenience, or policy as they believed it to be.</p>

But, having proposed to show it by an incompetent witness, it was rightly rejected, whether it would have been admissible through another medium or not.</p>
