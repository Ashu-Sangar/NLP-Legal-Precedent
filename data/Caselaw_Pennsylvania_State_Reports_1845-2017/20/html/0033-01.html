To one the idea of preferences to creditors releasing was prominent, and the effort in the first part of the section is to avoid the effect of any condition for release: to the other that of really securing what was not in danger, that is, the lien of a <em>bona fide </em>judgment, and is contained in the form of a proviso, not really appropriate to the section in which it is inserted, but to the original law of 1843, which was evidently what was in the mind of the draftsman of that proviso.
