    <p class="summary" id="b62-12" data-blocks='[["BL_62.10",62,[288,1069,1177,734]]]'>This- was a.n action of ejectment by the Society of United Brethren, for propagating the Grospel among the heathen, <em>v. </em>Luke Thayer, for about twenty acres of land. The plaintiff, in the description and writ, claimed the land as being 320 perches long from north to south, 10 perches wide from east to west, and as “ part of a larger tract of land patented by the Commonwealth to the plaintiff, on the 14th day of April, 1795.” On the trial, plaintiffs did not exhibit their patent, but gave in evidence two leases, each for 80 acres, from plaintiffs, by their agent, William Miles, to defendant. The first lease was for a term of seven years, and dated April 26, 1824; the second, for 14 years, and was dated Eeb. 15, 1833. The land was described in the two leases as having generally the same boundaries. But in the first .lease, the property leased was described as a tract of land beginning at a post on the state line, thence south, &amp;c., thence north one mile, <em>passing through the improvements of said Thayer, </em>&amp;c., Containing eighty acres of land.</p>

The defendant admitted that the boundary of the first lease, by passing through his then improvement, would include the land in controversy; but that the second, bounded by his land, excluded it, and insisted that it was part of his own land at and before the making of the lease, and had been so ever since. That he had been induced to sign the first lease through the representations of plaintiff’s agent that such lease would not prevent his (defendant’s) holding the land now in controversy, as his own, if within his lines; and he also insisted that the second lease, the eastern boundary of which called for defendant’s <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>own line, abrogated and annulled the first lease, so that the plaintiffs could not recover under it land that did not belong to them, but to the defendant. The defendant proved, that when plaintiff’s agent was running a north and south line between the plaintiff and defendant, and run through defendant’s field, 'defendant objected; and that the agent of plaintiffs assured the defendant that it was of no consequence where he put the line, that plaintiffs could only hold to their true original line, wherever it might be.</p>

It creates the relation of landlord and tenant. It is a solemn admission of the lessor’s title.

    <p id="b65-6" data-blocks='[["BL_65.4",65,[177,693,1171,992]]]'>We have thus given our opinion in the abstract upon the question argued. But it is impossible to give a final judgment on the case before us. The jury found a special verdict, but it omits almost every important fact. The defendant, it seems, accepted a lease from the plaintiff in 1824, and another in 1833. At the date of the first one he “ had enclosed of this land in dispute the field mentioned in the first lease, amounting to five and three-quarter acres, and continued in possession to this time as at the time of the leases.” This is absolutely all that the verdict finds. Whether the two leases were for the same land; whether either of them embraced the whole of the land in dispute; whether the defendant was in possession only of the five and three-quarter acres, or of all that is claimed in this suit; whether any fraud was committed by the plaintiff, or any mistake by the defendant; all these questions of fact have been left open, and some of them have been argued here as if we were expected to determine them. What is worse, the verdict does not say whether the defendant has any title, and it leaves the plaintiff in the same-condition; for though it says that a field mentioned in the first lease is a part of the land in dispute, when we turn to the lease we find no word about any field there. Whatever is not found in a special verdict must be taken not to exist. It is useless to talk of what was proved. We can do nothing but send the cause back for a new trial.</p>
