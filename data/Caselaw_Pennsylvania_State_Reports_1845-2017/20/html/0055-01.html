Evidence has been given of the existence of two post corners, answering, in some respects, to the description of the will, which, in the opinion of the Court, creates what is called a latent ambiguity, and makes way for the introduction of parol evidence to dissolve it. Ever since Cheney’s case, 5 <em>Oo. </em>68, the law has been settled, that when there is a latent ambiguity, arising <em>dehors </em>the will, as to the person or subject meant to be described, parol evidence may he introduced to remove the doubt.</p>

It is 44|- deg. west of south. Now, if mistaken in the bearing of the race, it is argued that he was most probably mistaken in respect to the bearing of the eastern course. We do not think there is much in this; but you can take it for what it is worth. We will now turn your attention to the parol evidence, and all the evidence introduced on each side, establishing the one or the other of these corners.” The Court also directed the attention of the jury to the fact that in the deed from Thomas Brownfield to his son <em>John, </em>dated in 1796, the corner now claimed to by the plaintiff was called a <em>stone corner.</em>
