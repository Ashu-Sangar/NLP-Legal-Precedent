Crook, and for nonpayment thereof, a levy was made by the constable of Nether • Providence under a warrant from the treasurer, upon five cows of Crook’s.

The cases of special agency whereto relation is made, were of a character entirely different from the one before us, one being where the agent who purchased the land bought it for the executor, and the other was a case of gross and outrageous fraud. [It is not the crier at a sale, but the seller, that is precluded from purchasing.] Neither the executor or administrator, nor commissioners of bankrupts, nor attorneys and solicitors, nor even auctioneers on all occasions, cry their own sales; but they are the sellers, they are the trustees, having the confidence of the parties, and shall not be permitted to purchase <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>at their own sales. [This was not the sale of Williams, and he' stood in no relation of confidence to the parties interested, which could have been affected by fraud/] No public policy can be outraged by this proceeding. [Williams stood in the same relation to the parties as does the clerk or the individual who delivers from their places the articles to be sold. He held up for public sale the property to be disposed of, and solicited the bids of the crowd at the sale. This is not such a trust as is contemplated in the law.} Actual fraud, even in the case before us, would avoid the sale, as fraud vitiates all transactions into which it enters; but nothing bearing the color of fraud has been suggested here.”</p>
