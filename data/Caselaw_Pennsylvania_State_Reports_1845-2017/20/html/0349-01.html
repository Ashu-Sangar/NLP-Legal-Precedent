It is supposed to have been omitted accidentally in the engrossment of the Act of 1794. The Act of 1833 has restored it. The words used have long since received judicial interpretation.

The words “heirs at law” are but words of description; but if intended to cast the estate, as though in case of intestacy, it is obvious that, as the law stood (which the testator is presumed to have known), the property would have been divided as it has been. The then existing law of 1794 (the will being made in 1832) describes who shall be heir at law, and the testator uses the same words of description with the same meaning. This is known by his adding the words “ <em>or their legal </em>representativesfor" if a contrary construction of his language 'be adopted, the death of Mrs. Stook, the present appellant, would' have barred her representatives, if there had been any of a nearer generation.</p>

But it is a “ Statute” relating to the descent and distribution of the estates of “ <em>Intestates,” </em>and the clause relied upon is a proviso to the 7th section, admitting collateral <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>relatives, in default of certain others named in a preceding section. <em>This </em>is not a case of <em>intestacy, </em>nor does it relate to the distribution of the estate of <em>an intestate, </em>and therefore the 8th section does not apply; for the only intestacy would be that of Mrs. Tlergesheimer, whose lineal descendants are the appellees.</p>

The present will is of this kind.</p>

Stook, a brother’s daughter, and several grandnephews and grandnieces, the grandchildren of a sister, who was living at his death, but died afterwards. The question is, does Ann O.

Is this his meaning ? He gives it to his “ then heirs at law or their legal representatives.” Why shall we reject this last part of the expression? It may indeed be redundant, if the former part be taken strictly; but, if it be itself taken strictly, it throws back the redundancy upon the word “then.” We therefore gain nothing by this suggestion; for we know not which to reject or modify. But is the expression not rather elliptical than redundant? Is it not equivalent to saying —I give it to my heirs, or to the legal representatives of such as would have been heirs if then living ? A man is quite as apt to be elliptical as redundant, in writing his will, if not much more so. If the reading just suggested is the true one, then the grandmother <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>of the Hergesheimers took a vested estate, and they take as her heirs. And the law leans in favor of this construction, by favoring, in doubtful cases, the claim of the heir who was such at the death, and by preferring a vested to a contingent estate, where the intention is uncertain.</p>
    <p id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[216,622,1167,517]]]'>The circumstances show that the use of the word “then” can be very easily accounted for, and that it is possibly misplaced. He provides that the old homestead of the family, which he had obtained from his father, shall remain during life with his two old maiden sisters, and it was perfectly natural that he should next provide that it should then go (as we read it) to his other heirs or their legal representatives; in other words, to the remaining descendants of his father. Following this construction, we retain the words “or their legal representatives;” and it is certainly much more probable that the word “then” should have been misplaced than tha,t these other words should have been used without any corresponding idea in the mind of the testator.</p>
    <p id="b355-7" data-blocks='[["BL_355.5",355,[209,1139,1173,773]]]'>Let it be granted that the foregoing exposition is not entirely satisfactory; it becomes so when we view this clause in another aspect. Who are described as devisees? His “then heirs at law or their legal representatives.” This description is peculiar, and it is very hard to believe that it was used except to convey the idea that, if any of- his heirs should die before the estate should vest in possession, then the heirs or devisees of such heirs should take. He could not have meant to provide for their assigns, for, in another clause, he attempts to exclude the power of assignment as to one of them, even after the vesting in possession. Then he intended, as we have supposed; or he intended nothing by the words “legal representatives,” which we cannot suppose. These words are truly descriptive of the devisees, and not words of limitation ; otherwise we fall into another difficulty; for he uses words of limitation immediately afterwards, “to them, their heirs and assigns for ever.” It follows, therefore, that the Qourt below was. right in decreeing one-half to Mrs. Stook and the other half to theHergesheimers.</p>
