Unquestionably it looks only to the public protection, and to securing punctuality and honesty in the settlement of collectors’ accounts. It is intended to be in addition to the security furnished by the bond; and it would be strange, if this abundant eaution should be construed into an abandonment of all security. It is a rule intended to direct officers in their duty to the state or a portion of it. If it be transgressed, there is a breach of duty; but duty to whom ? To the state surely, and not to any of its citizens; and county commissioners may some day have to pay for the breach of it. If this regulation had been established for the protection of sureties, then "the breach of duty would have been an injury to them that might <em>possibly </em>be remedied by sustaining this defence.</p>
