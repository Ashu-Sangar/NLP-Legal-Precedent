This is generally true, <em>but </em>not universally so, if the term ‘nuisance’ be here used to indicate a structure destitute of the ordinary power of self-support, and ready to fall into ruins from its own weight. If such was the fact, the liability of the builder to answer for accidents resulting from inherent weakness would, of course, <em>be clear of all difficulty. </em>It would be unnecessary to call in the aid of legal learning to determine that the creator of such a ‘ dead fall’ would be answerable, to the whole extent of his fortune, for injuries sustained in its destruction. The learned and the ignorant, the lawyer and the layman, instructed intellect and unassisted reason would, necessarily, rush to the same conclusion. But in ascertaining whether an owner is obnoxious to a suit, the inquiry may be and often is, did he do all that was incumbent on a prudent, careful, and competent man to do, while the building was in progress, or afterwards, to render it reasonably secure, having special reference to the uses to which it was to be dedicated ? Or did he permit the building to pass from his possession; deficient in some particular essential to its future safety, when reasonably used in the business, and for the purposes for which it was constructed ? If from his carelessness, his recklessness, avarice, or ignorance, the latter was the condition of the building when it came into the hands of the lessee, whereby injury was inflicted on the person or property of another occupying and using it with due care, the owner or builder, and not the tenant, is he whom the law will compel to make reparation. What I mean by due care is, as perhaps already sufficiently expressed, that degree of caution which a prudent and instructed man would exhibit in the use of such a building, accounting it to be of the ordinary strength of similar structures. A proprietor has no right, either <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>expressly or impliedly, to hold out to the world a house, or other like erection, as sufficient for certain purposes, when in truth it is not so, and thus seduce others to confide in it, to their loss in body or estate.</p>

      <em>“ </em>On the other hand, if a building be put up <em>in the usual way, with the materials commonly employed, and ordinary caution and skill, </em>and there be no guarantee, express or implied, of a stipulated or ascertained capacity of endurance, the builder will not be liable for injury resulting from its subsequent destruction in the hands of a tenant, and much less will he be so if its destruction is attributable to a misuse of the premises by the tenant — as if he charge it beyond its known capacity.</p>

For example (and I think the illustration will commend itself as founded in good sense and sound reason), if one builds a dwelling-house, which he leases to another, and while in the occupancy of the latter it falls and injures a passenger in the street, the tenant would not be answerable simply because the ruined structure was 'in his possession at the moment of its fall. The remedy of the injured party would be determined by the cause of. the fall. If this was brought to pass by the unskilful manner in which the walls were built, or the defective character of the materials employed, the builder and owner would be the party subject to suit, for the reason that his acts of commission or omission occasioned the disaster. But if -this was the result of the occupant’s misconduct, as, for instance, bj^ using the house in an improper way, or carelessly omitting to amend a dangerous defect suddenly occurring, the tenant alone would be liable, and for precisely the same reason which, under the other state of supposed facts, would subject the landlord to punishment.</p>

If this were so, and the plaintiff disobeyed the orders communicated to them, whereby his suffering was occasioned, he ought not to recover. But if the crack was the immediate result of a defective construction, referable to the misconduct of the defendant, and the plaintiff was guilty of no disobedience, I cannot perceive that the uncommunicated orders of Mr. Harris ought to bar a right, otherwise well founded.

That it is the duty of the lessee'to ascertain the condition of the premises, and to use them in such manner that no loss shall result to any one. That he should not charge them to the utmost of their capacity, but only in a prudent and cautious manner. That the plaintiff in this case was in the employment of the lessee, and was not a third person having no direct connection with the building. That the lessee knew the condition of the building — the defect, if <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>any, in the arches; that it had been hut recently constructed; and that the party injured should look to him for redress: 2 <em>Eng.

The lease imposed no obligation, as between the parties to it, as to the strength of the store; it was leased without any specification as to the manner in which it was to be used, — and it was alleged that the tenant was cautioned as to its improper use.

In this case the building was leased for <em>a store, </em>and, according to the evidence, it was not adapted to support the articles ordinarily placed in such a building, though it appeared to possess that capacity. It is not to be presumed that the person leasing the building would be competent to judge of the strength of the walls. But however be the case between the lessor and lessee, it is contended that the owner of a defective building, which, during its occupancy by a tenant in the ordinary manner, falls and injures a third person, is liable to such person for the injury sustained, and that it is competent to such person to show that the building was constructed and leased for the particular purpose for which it was used. It is not material that the conversation in question was not communicated to the person injured. In addition to the testimony, the mere lease of the property for a <em>store </em>for government purposes, implied that it was designed for <em>heavy storage.</em>

But it was contended that it was produced through the conduct of <em>the owner </em>of the building. In the case of Keats <em>v. </em>Cadogan, cited, there was nothing in the declaration to show that the plaintiff was not to put the house in repair before occupying it. In this case there is a covenant <em>to repair. </em>In the case of Rich <em>v. </em>Basterfield, 66 <em>Eng. C. L.

It was contended that, in this case, the fall of the building was not reasonably to be anticipated. In the case of Offerman <em>v. </em>Starr, 2 <em>Barr </em>394, the injury was caused by the negligent working of a mine by the tenant, which the landlord could not prevent. In this case, Harris testified, “ When I rented the building, I supposed it perfectly good.” The case is not put on the obligation' of either party <em>to repair; </em>but on the defects in the original construction of the building, arising from <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>the negligence of the defendant; that the arches were elliptical, instead of regular arches or solid walls.</p>
