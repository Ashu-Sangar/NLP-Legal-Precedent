    <p class="summary" id="b445-10" data-blocks='[["BL_445.8",445,[210,1403,1176,515]]]'>This was the case of a lien for materials furnished by Taylor and Williams, the same amounting to $&gt;568.21-|-, and being filed against thirty-two three-story brick houses, situate in the district of Spring Harden, sixteen of them being situate on the north side of Wood street, between Broad and Thirteenth, &amp;c., the said buildings forming a continuous row of houses; and the other sixteen being situate on the south side of Bloom alley, between Broad and Thirteenth streets, also forming a continuous row. The claim was filed also against the ground and curtilages appurtenant to the buildings. It was filed against Joseph Montgomery, as owner or reputed owner,- and contractor. In the claim filed, the claim against each building and ground appurtenant was designated.</p>

Subsequently the plaintiffs, Taylor and Williams, and Montgomery, entered into thirty-two amicable actions of <em>scire facias, </em>on- the apportionments of the claim, they being entered to September Term, 1851, and Montgomery confessed judgment in each case. Writs of <em>levari facias </em>were issued, but subsequently, on the application of T. J. Martin, a terre tenant, rules were ordered, and the judgments were opened, and Martin let into a defence.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b446-7" data-blocks='[["BL_446.5",446,[300,713,1168,901]]]'>The opinion of the Court was as follows: — “ This was an apportioned claim for materials against thirty-two houses, all on the same lot, but fronting on different streets, sixteen being on one street, and sixteen on the other. It was held by this Court, in December Term, in the case of Campbell <em>v. </em>Pharo, on the authority of Young and Chambers, 3 <em>Harris, </em>that one claim cannot be filed against several houses, unless they are contiguous and constitute one building, It has been sought to distinguish this case from that of Campbell <em>v. </em>Pharo, on the ground that there the lots were separated, as well'.as the houses, by an intervening lot belonging to a third person; and it was contended that where, as in this instance, all the buildings are on one lot,- and the curtilages adjoin, although the houses do not, the whole must be considered as an unit for the purposes of a claim which covers the curtilages as well as the houses. We should be disposed to attach much weight to this argument, were it not overruled, by the authority of Young <em>v. </em>Chambers, <em>where </em>the circumstances and situation of the premises were precisely the same as here, and where the claim was held invalid. The verdict for the plaintiff is consequently set aside, and judgment entered <em>for the defendant </em>on the point reserved.”</p>
