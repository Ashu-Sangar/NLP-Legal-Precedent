It was issued for the use of Basil Brownfield, against Baily, the defendant. The suit in which the judgment was obtained was brought to June term, 1841, on a promissory note for $1500. April 5, 1841, judgment was entered for $1580.63.</p>

The sum of $1500 was borrowed out of the Monongahela Bank of Brownsville, on a note of which William Baily was the drawer, and Basil Brownfield and <em>Isaac Nixon </em>were the endorsers. About $850 of this sum was laid out by them in the purchase of hogs in the state of Ohio, and in driving them to Basil Brownfield’s, in Payette county, Pa., where they were kept for a while, and then killed and salted, the bacon subsequently taken to Baltimore and. sold, and the whole proceeds received by Brownfield. The remaining $600 was lent to Isaac Nixon, the other endorser. The note in the bank not being paid, suits were brought against Baily as drawer, and Brownfield as endorser, and judgments obtained for the same. Subsequently Brownfield’s real estate was sold on other judgments, and out of part of the proceeds of the sale the judgment of the bank was paid. This <em>scire facias </em>was issued at the instance of Brownfield, on the judgment of tho bank against Baily, to recover a balance alleged to be due him on this partnership transaction. The judgment of the bank against Baily had been marked on the docket, by the attorney of the bank, as paid, and no subrogation or assignment of the judgment to Brownfield had been directed or made, and no account was ever settled between Baily and Brownfield of the partnership transaction.</p>

The judgment was obtained by the Bank of Brownsville on a note made by Baily, and endorsed by Brownfield and one Isaac Nixon, and discounted by the bank. Baily and Brownfield were partners, and the money was obtained for the purposes of their business. The proceeds of the note were paid to Baily, who soon after gave to Brownfield eight hundred and fifty dollars to buy stock; and the remaining six hundred and fifty dollars was lent to Nixon on the understanding that he should pay that amount to the bank on the note. This he never did, but he paid Brownfield three hundred and sixty-three dollars of it. I do not say that these facts were either proven or admitted; but there was some evidence tending to establish them, and for the purpose of reviewing the judgment we must assume them here to be true.</p>
    <p id="b47-7" data-blocks='[["BL_47.5",47,[192,1147,1172,774]]]'>Where partners borrow money to be used in the business which they are jointly carrying on, it becomes a partnership fund; and no matter how they stand on the security given to the lender, they are accountable to one another as partners. The relation of principal and surety can have no place between them. It does not alter this case that Baily received the proceeds of the note; for-property or stock or money which belongs to a firm is as rightly in the hands of one member as another. The possession of one is, in law, the possession of both. The subsequent loan of a part of it to a third person does not change their relations. Even the misapplication of a partnership fund by one of the partners, cannot make the other a surety, if he was not so before; much less an arrangement in good faith by which a joint debt was to be partly paid, and least of all, a loan of the fund with the mutual consent of both partners, as there is much reason' to believe this was. Look at this case how we will, the judgment paid by Brownfield was a partnership debt, and for the payment he was entitled to a credit in the partnership accounts.</p>

Now suppose every other difficulty out of the way; suppose, what is not the law, that a partner, after paying a partnership debt, may be substituted to the rights of the creditor as against his copartner; or suppose, what is not fact, that this -was not a debt of the firm; still, injustice may be done by allowing the plaintiff to be subrogated without first accounting to the defendant for the profits of the business in which they were jointly engaged.

If there is anything due to him, account render, where each party can be put on his oath, is the only remedy at law, and to that action, or to a bill in equity for an account, he ought to be remitted.</p>
