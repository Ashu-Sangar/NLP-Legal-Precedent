In June 1850, cattle of the defendant broke, from the highway, through the fence of the plaintiff, into his field in which wheat and rye were then growing. The cattle were driven out by the plaintiff and others in his employ, to the barn of the defendant and left there. The plaintiff afterwards made application to a justice of the peace. The record sent up with the appeal was to this effect:</p>

The present plaintiff did not distrain the cattle doing the damage, and the attempt in this case by the justice to proceed under the Act of 13th April, 1807, ‘ concerning strays,’ is by consequence erroneous. His effort to administer justice may, nevertheless, be sustained as an action of trespass under the 4th section of the Act of 1810, called ‘the one hundred dollar Act;’ which enacts, that upon appeal, ‘ the cause shall be decided * * * on its facts and merits only, and no deficiency of form and substance in the record or proceedings, nor any mistake in the form or name of the action, shall prejudice either party in the Court to which the appeal shall be made.’</p>

At common law every entry of cattle on the land of another without license is a trespass, congeable indeed, in Pennsylvania, if the land be unenclosed, but actionable if enclosed. Was the land, where the trespass was committed, enclosed? This is a question for you. If it was, then the amount of damages is a matter of computation by the jury, under all the facts of the ease, among which sufficiency of the enclosure may be considered for the purpose of increasing or diminishing those damages.”</p>
