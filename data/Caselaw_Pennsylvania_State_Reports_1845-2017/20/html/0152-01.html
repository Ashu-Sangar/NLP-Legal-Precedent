It was <em>held, </em>that the judgments thus jirsi obtained were not fraudulent by virtue of the proviso to the 4th section of the Act of 16th April, 1849, relative .to assignments, and that the executions on such judgments being first in order of time, were entitled to a preference in the distribution of the proceeds of personal property sold under them.</p>

Morrow, returnable to the first Monday of April, 1852. On that day the defendant entered appearance to some of the actions, and therefore, under the rules of Court, the plaintiffs in these cases were not entitled to judgment for ten days. Morgan and Morrow, the appellants, who were plaintiffs in two of the suits against A. C. Morrow, took judgments upon the return day, viz., the 5th April, according to the rules, <em>for default of appearance ; </em>and issued executions. The appellees obtained judgments after-wards, viz., on 16th April, for want of a plea and affidavit of defence, and executions were issued on their judgments. The sheriff proceeded to sell the personal property of the defendant; <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>and, on 21st May, 1852, a rule was taken to bring the money into Court for distribution.</p>

The opinion of this Court, delivered by Mr. Justice Lewis last .June, in Worman <em>v. </em>Wolfersberger, which was a stronger case than this, makes it unnecessary to discuss the principles involved in it. For the reasons there given, the decree of the Common Pleas must be reversed.</p>
