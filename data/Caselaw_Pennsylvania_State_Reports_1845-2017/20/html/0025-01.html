As to the identity of the land assessed, with that patented to John Morgan as 300 acres, and called <em>‘ </em>Shrewsbury,’ you have first the evidence of Mr. Potter, one of the Commissioners of the county, that he could find no assessments for Hopewell township earlier than the year 1803; also of Mr. McCallister, who says that Hopewell township was formed during the last war. Daniel Leieh says the <em>‘ </em>Shrewsbury’ tract went by the name of the Stillman tract. This, then, in connection with the fact that no tract in either Moon or Hopewell was assessed as the Shrewsbury tract, would be, perhaps, satisfactory to the jury, that the tract assessed in the name of John M. Stillman was the Shrewsbury tract. The fact that the assessment is made for but 200 instead of 300 acres, may be accounted for by the evidence of such witnesses as Rpbert Hood and others, that the father of Robert Hood purchased, at an ea.rly period, 100 acres off the Shrewsbury tract. It is true, some of the witnesses are unable to say when the purchase was made precisely. Leich recollects that Hood was there as early as 1810. The lines are found separating the 100 acres from the other portion of the tract, and it appears to have been assessed to Hood as early as 1802. It is further in evidence, that the duplicates containing the assessments cannt be found in the office prior to 1802.</p>

This, then, would validate the assessment. It is not questioned but that the title is, and was out of the Commonwealth. And as to the 200 acres assessed, they must be considered as unseated, unless some other person than Hood was in possession of the tract; and if there was, we have failed to perceive the evidence.</p>

The evidence is that <em>William Jordan, </em>according to the recollection of Leich, <em>tools possession as early as </em>1810; in this he is corroborated by the assessments.

He is first assessed in 1880; this suit was brought in the beginning of 1850; Dolen’s article is dated 1st December, 1828; so that [if he was in possession 21 years before the bringing of this suit, it is as much as can be said.

In consequence of the decision in Wain <em>v. </em>Shearman, the Act of 29th March, 1824, made provision for bringing an ejectment against a purchaser who had not taken possession, and gave to any person “ then having a right of entry because no actual possession had been taken of the land so sold,” a right of action within two years from the date of the Act. In this case no action was brought within the two years prescribed, or at a.ny time. Since the Act of 1824, the limitation commences to run <em>from the delivery of the deed to the purchaser: </em>Robb <em>v. </em>Bowen, 9 <em>Barr </em>71. <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>It is not necessary in this case to decide that the action of the original owner would have been barred even in the absence of possession under the sale; but, under the uncontradicted evidence of actual possession, taken in 1809, and continued till this time without interruption, his action is clearly barred, and the title under the sale for taxes is perfect.</p>
    <p id="b34-5" data-blocks='[["BL_34.4",34,[355,658,1162,729]]]'>The statement that “if Dolen was in possession twenty-one years before the bringing of this suit, it is as much as can be said,” was an intimation of the opinion of the Court on a question of fact, which did not take its ultimate decision from the jury. It is therefore not ground for reversal. Rut the error did the defendants below no harm, for it conceded to them a possession of sufficient duration for their purposes. A longer possession than twenty-one years, under the circumstances of this case, would not have secured to the plaintiffs in error any material advantages on the trial; for there is no evidence whatever to show that their possession was taken before that of the defendants in error, which, as already stated, commenced in 1809. This is a case of interfering surveys or titles with each party in actual possession under his own title, but neither party enclosing, or cultivating, or otherwise actually occupying the part included in the interference. Under such circumstances, the law adjudges the possession of it <em>to be </em>in the rightful owner.</p>
    <p id="b34-6" data-blocks='[["BL_34.5",34,[353,1386,1158,673]]]'>It is complained that the Court stated in its charge that, “ as to the part, if any, cleared or enclosed more than twenty-one years before the commencement of the suit, we have no evidence of either its position or quantity. No surveyor has marked it; no witness has designated it with certainty; you have no evidence; none was offered you from which you could form or dictate any description. If, therefore, you find for the plaintiffs, it must be generally; and if they choose to take possession of any improvements made more than twenty-one years before the suit was brought, the defendant may regain possession by bringing ejectment against them.” We perceive nothing in the evidence to justify any complaint against this instruction. If the plaintiffs in error relied upon their deed from Dolen as fixing the boundaries of their possession, this will not enable them to hold by constructive possession any part of the older and better title in the actual possession of the owner.</p>
    <p id="b34-7" data-blocks='[["BL_34.6",34,[351,2070,1156,343]],["BL_35.1",35,[244,407,1160,387]]]'>To disseise the rightful owner in actual possession, an actual occupancy within his lines by the disseissor is indispensable. In such a. case the statute of limitations will have no effect, except as to the part which is actually enclosed: Cluggage <em>v. </em>Duncan, 1 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>111. If the plaintiffs in error relied upon such actual enclosure, it was their duty to show, by a draft, supported by the evidence, or by other means perfectly satisfactory, the extent, location, and duration of such enclosure. It is peculiarly incum<a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>bent upon a party, claiming, to hold land by virtue of such- an occupancy, to furnish the means of setting it off to him with certainty. In such a matter there should be no guess-work. Where the claimant of such a possession occupies the attention of a jury with the extent of his <em>present </em>enclosures, 'instead of distinctly defining their extent and location <em>as existing </em>21 <em>years before the suit was brought, </em>he is pursuing the shadow and forgetting the substance. The directions of the Court on this part of the case meet our cordial approbation.</p>

Patterson, in which the opinion of the Court was delivered in December, 1853, by Lewis, J., it has been again decided that under the Act of 29th March, 1824, the limitation of five years begins to run against the former owner, not from the time when possession was taken in pursuance of the sale for taxes, but from the delivery of the treasurer’s deed to the purchaser.</p>
