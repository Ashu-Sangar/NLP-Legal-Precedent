It was not intended to make him personally liable, at all events. </em>Neither was it intended that the plaintiff should be paid to the exclusion of the purchase-money due Gaskill and others, and the necessary agencies and expenses connected with the sale to the German Society. These had a prior and permanent lien upon the fund, inasmuch as an application of them to the plaintiff, would prejudice the right of Thomas Struthers, not a party to this contract. All these claims, therefore, must, in justice to the parties, be paid out of the funds arising from the sale, before any part of them could he appropriated by the parties themselves, or be properly applied to the individual liability of the partners, Wilcox and Struthers. If the Court be correct in this view of the subject, it becomes important for the jury to determine whether there was any surplus, after paying all the claims upon the funds to he divided between the partners. If the jury should he of opinion there was, then Wilcox would he liable to the extent, not exceeding one thousand dollars, with interest, thus received. He would have been the recipient of moneys, which, by this contract, he had agreed should be received by the plaintiff. If, on the other hand, the jury should be of opinion that there was no surplus after paying the purchase-money and the necessary charges and expenses, then there would <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>be nothing upon which this contract by its terms could operate, and the plaintiff would not be entitled to recover.”</p>
