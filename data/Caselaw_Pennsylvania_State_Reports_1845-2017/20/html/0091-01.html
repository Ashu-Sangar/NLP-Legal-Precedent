    <p id="b96-7" data-blocks='[["BL_96.5",96,[341,921,1170,1503]]]'>The sixth section of tho general law, regulating turnpike and plank-road companies, passed 26th January, 1849, provides that the company may enter upon all the lands in, through, and over which the road may pass, with the same right and under the same penalties as supervisors of highways. It contains no provision for damages, and the ninth section does not help it out. The compensation there provided is for another class of injuries, namely, those which the company may commit on the contiguous lands by entering to get materials. The act of 1849, therefore, gives authority to the turnpike and plank-road companies to take the land of private individuals for the bed of the roads, without paying for it. But by the first section of a supplementary act, passed the same session (27th April, 1849), it is declared that, in all cases of injury committed under the sixth section of the original act, the owner shall be entitled to recover damages, to be assessed in the manner prescribed by the ninth section. This provision for compensation is as broad as the authority to take the land, given by the previous statute to the companyand if the plaintiff below had no right to be compensated for the injury done to his woodland, then the company had no right to. put their road on it. It is very clear, that as the company were authorized to take the land by the original law, and made liable to all damages by the supplement, the Court ,was right in refusing to make any distinction between the wood-land and the rest of the farm. By section nine of the act of 14th May, 1850, the advantages were required to be taken into consideration, in estimating the damages. From all these statutes, taken together, it results that a person upon whose land a turnpike o.r plank-road is located, may recover damages to an amount which, if added to the present value of his land, would make it worth as much a.s it was before the road was made. In other words, he may lawfully demand compensation for all his land appropriated, as well as all his improvements destroyed, deducting therefrom the benefits and advantages which he derived from the road, and the additional value given by it to his property.</p>
