When the plaintiff in' error substitutes his own language, he does so at his peril.\nError to the Common Pleas of Indiana county.\nThis was an action of ejectment' by Nicholas Altemus v. Matthew Criswell, for above 164 acres of land, being the north end' of a certain tract, warranted in the name of William Morrell, and which Altemus, by articles of agreement, dated 4th April, 1840, agreed to sell to Criswell, and covenanted to convey in fee simple. The tract adjoined a tract of land surveyed in the name of Robert Hogg.\nIn March, -1842, Altemus tendered to Criswell a deed for the land agreed to be sold.\nAt the time of the contract, and till the trial of the case, Andrew Campbell, who resided on the survey in the name of Robert Hogg, was in possession of about.seven or eight acres of the northeast corner of the northern half of the Morrell survey, and, it was said, had acquired title to that much of it by the statute of limitations ; and the defendant claimed a deduction from the amount of the consideration mentioned in the article of agreement, on account of the quantity of land in; the occupancy of Campbell.\nIt was assigned as error, That the Court erred \u201cin leaving it as a, question of fact to the jury to find whether that part of the William Morrell survey, which was in the possession of Andrew Campbell, was included in the contract between the parties.\u201d\nWhite, for plaintiff in error.\nDrum, for the defendant, the Court declined to hear."
