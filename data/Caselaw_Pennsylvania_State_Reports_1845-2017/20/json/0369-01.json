Silver, from the decision of the county commissioners increasing the valuation of certain lands in Blythe township, Schuylkill county, known as \u201cThe Valley Furnace Lands.\u201d\nThe lands were valued by the assessors, at the triennial assessment in 1850, at $73,885. After the appeals were held, at which the owners did not attend, the county commissioners raised the valuation of the lands above referred to, to $113,210. Under the provisions of the 7th section of the Act of 26th April, 1850, referred to in the case of Kimber v. Schuylkill County (antea 368), an appeal from the action of the county commissioners was taken to the Court of Common Pleas. On the 18th June, 1851, by order of the associate judges, the president judge dissenting, the appeal was dismissed.\nA certiorari was issued, and it was assigned for error, that \u201c the\u2019 Court erred in dismissing the appeal, and in not reducing the valuation to that returned by the assessors.\u201d\nParry, for the plaintiff in error.\nBannan, for the county."
