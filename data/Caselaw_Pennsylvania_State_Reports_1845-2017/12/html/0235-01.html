Bell, dated March 16,1846, like every other document of the kind, was liable to and susceptible of explanation by competent parol testimony.

In this case it would seem from the statements at bar, that Mr. Fenton retired from the argument of the cause below, when he found it necessary that he should be a witness. That was a commendable delicacy. It was always done by the old lawyers, so far as I know the practice.</p>
    <p id="b236-9" data-blocks='[["BL_236.12",236,[292,1636,1186,145]]]'>Mr. Fenton was therefore a competent witness, and the evidence proposed to be given by him was pertinent and relevant to the issue, and ought to have been admitted.</p>
