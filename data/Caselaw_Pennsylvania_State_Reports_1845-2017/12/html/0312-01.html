In deciding this point, you may take into consideration the fact that this is an <em>old transcript </em>made out near twenty years ago: that there is no evidence before us that an execution or <em>sei. fa. </em>was ever issued till the present. You may also reflect upon the fact that this old transcript was not filed until nineteen years and five months after the recovery of the judgment; that the docket of the magistrate has not been produced; but the evidence is that the justice said he went to Texas, and his docket was lost. It is proper for you to consider whether, if the judgment had not been paid, the plaintiff would have suffered it to rest without some effort to collect it until now. That the original plaintiff is not moving in the matter, but a second or third assignee who has got hold of it.</p>

But exactly what these circumstances may be, never has been, and never will'be, defined by the law. There must be some circumstances; and where there are any, it is safe to leave them to the jury. Here there were several circumstances. No certificate was given by the justice that he had issued execution, to which there was a return of <em>nulla bona; </em>and this was important, as the record still remained before the justice, who might receive the money, or collect it by execution. And there was the pregnant circum<a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>stance that the plaintiff produced hearsay evidence that the transcript was genuine, and that the justice had said that his docket was lost. The justice was not produced himself, to «show that the docket was lost, and that search was made for it. This would have been unnecessary if the transcript had been entered in any reasonable time; but after the lapse of nineteen years and seven months, it would seem to be a reasonable duty on the part of the plaintiff, and the absence of which might' fairly be taken into consideration.</p>
