This is a distinction which I have never heard disputed, for the very object of placing them around the testator, is to try, judge, and determine whether he is competent to execute the instrument. The subscribing witnesses testify their opinion; other witnesses testify to the appearance of the testator or to any other particular fact, from which the state of his mind may be inferred. It is to the latter class of cases, not to the former, the authorities cited, apply. This disposes of the second bill; but in addition, it is plain the testimony of the witness was to facts, not opinions, and would have been competent testimony independent of the circumstance that he was a subscribing witness.</p>

The defendant, as appears, took the deposition of McGinnis, and read it on the trial, •without exception, declining, for reasons satisfactory to himself, to read the answers to the 7th and 8th interrogatories. This the plaintiffs might have prevented by an exception; for a party who offers in evidence a deposition taken in his behalf must read the whole, and cannot select portions and omit others, as is ruled in Southwark Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Knight, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Whart.%20329" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Whart. 329">6 Whart. 329</a>.

This cannot be done.. It has been ruled (which is an analogous case) that you have no right to propound questions to a witness for the mere purpose of discrediting him by testimony of other witnesses to the same fact.

The error, it is true, is incorrectly assigned, as the points referred to were reserved by the Court and were not charged on at all. The assignment should have been to the judgment of the Court on the points reserved. We think, however, the error is substantially assigned. If necessary, we would allow the party to amend, as wq would not permit the title to be tripped up by a mere matter of form. The error goes to the title. Was there then error in the judgment of the Court on the points reserved ? We think not. The testator being proved to be of sound, disposing mind and understanding, it passes a title to the land in controversy to the defendant. It is not true that the defendant failed to comply with the conditions contained in the will. The article of 29th May, 1848, which is contemporaneous with the will, is a full compliance with all the stipulations contained in the contract. We see nothing in the agreement contrary to any known rule of policy. It is nothing more than a contract, by which a person in the decline of life makes a comfortable provision for himself and wife, for their old age. If they can make an absolute conveyance of all their property for such a consideration, as they undoubtedly can, what is to prevent them from doing the same thing in the form of a will ? Here the parties <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>have carried the contract into effect in good faith, and it is heirs who have no equity, who are endeavouring to disturb the arrangement. Were it even an executory agreement, the party having failed to make á will, equity, no doubt, would decree a conveyance, and a jury would give damages to the amount of the value of the property. But be this as it may, we' see nothing to invalidate the title which the defendant acquired under the will. The case cited from <a href="/watts-serg/2/0145-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 145" data-case-ids="1853551" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0145-01">2 W. &amp; S. 145</a>, Todd’s case, has no application whatever. All that is ruled there is that when one in contemplation of a journey thus begins an informal testamentary paper,—“My wish, desire, and intention now is, that if I should not return (which I will, no preventing Providence), what I own shall be divided as follows,”—upon his return and subsequent death, the instrument ought not to be admitted to probate. It is very clear that it was a provisional arrangement, to be effective only in case he never returned from his contemplated journey. We do not see the slightest resemblance to this case.</p>
