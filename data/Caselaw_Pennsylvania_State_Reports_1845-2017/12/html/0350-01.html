In reaching that question, however, it is absolutely necessary to consider the social relation of the parties, and to estimate its effect on the question of property. One party invokes the protection of a clear and explicit provision of the constitution. And to reach that, we must, if necessary, go over an interposing Act of Assembly. In England, parliament has frequently annulled the contract of marriage for adultery. There is, perhaps, more reason for the practice there than existed in this gtate for the exercise of a similar power by the legislature; because parliament is a Court. Lord Coke says it is the highest and most honourable Court in the kingdom. But that high Court proceeds with the utmost circumspection, examines witnesses to prove the adultery, and in cases where the guilty parties have not left the realm, requires that there shall also have been a trial in the common law Courts for criminal conversation, and damages recovered, and also that a sentence of divorce in the spiritual Court should have been decreed, which can only divorce <em>a mensa et thoro ; </em>hence the necessity of the intervention of parliament to divorce <em>a </em>vinculo, whose power, only, is adequate to that end. But in this gtate, the legislature seems to have acted on the ground that it was an exercise of legislative power, and therefore <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>not requiring a judicial examination. We think, however, that this doctrine may be well questioned.</p>
    <p id="b354-3" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[310,498,1189,1178]]]'>A divorce annuls a civil contract between two individuals, of a higher and more imposing nature, and of more emphatic emphasis on the whole structure of society, than the voluntary contracts, by deed or by parol. And there flows from the severance of the contract, a divestiture of property from one .and a re-investment of it in the other. It is in fact a judgment in a dispute between two individuals, the justice of which must depend upon facts in relation to which both parties ought to have an opportunity to be heard. But however questionable the power might have been under the Constitution of 1790, the amended Constitution of 1838 did expressly prohibit its exercise by the legislature, wherever the Courts then had or should thereafter be vested with power; from which an implication results of a power to annul the marriage contract in the non-enumerated cases. The legislature has therefore a limited power, with an express prohibition outside of the limitation. Sec. 14, art. 1, is as follows: <em>“ </em>The legislature shall not have power to enact laws annulling the contract of marriage in any case where by law the Courts of this Commonwealth are or may hereafter be empowered to decree a divorce.” The Courts have now power to decree a divorce in almost every case where a divorce is justifiable. The Act of Assembly does not express on its face, or in a preamble, the cause of the divorce in the present case. It is in these words: [His Honour here stated it: see ante, pp. 350-351.]</p>
    <p id="b354-4" data-blocks='[["BL_354.5",354,[310,1684,1189,403]]]'>It does not appear from the Act whether the case was within legislative power or not. And the position taken by the defendant in error, is, that Courts cannot go, as they call it, behind the Act itself to ascertain whether it was within the pale of the Constitution or not. But I apprehend that we can, in all cases, go to the Constitution itself. The majestic impersonation of the sovereign people speaking through the Constitution, is always present in this Court, and must always be heard and obeyed.</p>
    <p id="b354-5" data-blocks='[["BL_354.6",354,[309,2094,1192,407]],["BL_355.1",355,[138,379,1190,767]]]'>The power confided to the legislature is a limited power, and it cannot be allowed that they should convert it into an unlimited power. If they can convert a special jurisdiction into a general jurisdiction, the provision of the Constitution becomes dead. If Courts cannot or will not go behind the Act, where the cause is not expressed on its face, the clause in the Constitution might as well have been that the legislature shall annul, &amp;c., as that they shall not. It requires but a trick of the pen to leave out the cause, and then <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>the power becomes general. A great number of authorities have been cited by the defendant in error to show that in judicial proceedings the judgment of a Court of competent and general jurisdiction over the subject-matter, cannot be overhauled in a collateral proceeding. All this is admitted, but then it is to be understood that the party was affected with notice in the mode pointed out and prescribed by the law. But no Court ever held that a judgment against an individual who had no notice whatever was valid. Wo know that the legislature never summon the party, and that they proceed, in nine cases out of ten, upon <em>ex parte </em>testimony. The cases therefore are not applicable. But the counsel assume the fact in contest, and then lean on those authorities. The legislature have not a general jurisdiction over the subject of divorce. Their jurisdiction is limited, and these authorities, even assimilating the proceeding to analogous cases in Court, do not touch the question.</p>
    <p id="b355-4" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[136,1154,1190,1330]],["BL_356.1",356,[294,473,1183,606]]]'>It was however ruled in Kemp <em>v. </em>Kennedy, 1 Peters’s Cir. Court Reports, 36, that Courts of limited jurisdiction must not only act within the scope of their authority, but that it must appear on the face 'of their proceedings that they did so, and if it does not so appear, all their proceedings are <em>coram non judice. </em>This is the general principle as to Courts of limited jurisdiction, so that every just analogy drawn from proceedings of Courts is against the defendant. But I place the decision on the broad ground that the Constitution must be preserved, and that if Courts should refuse to permit evidence to show the grounds of the divorce, the legislature could obliterate the clause in the Constitution. This is a question of property resulting from the divorce. The party has a right to the protection of the constitutional provision, and if necessary, the Court can touch the Act with the judicial wand, and open it to inspection, so as to see whether or not it is within the pale of the Constitution. The evil of this example would not terminate with this class .of cases, but reach with fatal effect to others. The legislature can <em>aliene </em>and grant the public domain not already appropriated. They have therefore a limited jurisdiction in granting lands. Suppose they were to pass a law granting throe hundred acres of land on-the Delaware, by well defined boundaries, to John Doe, could not the real owner of the land' be permitted to show that the land had been granted more than a hundred years ago, to those under whom he claimed, and that therefore the legislature had no power or jurisdiction over it ? Not so, if full effect is given to the argument of the counsel for defendant in error. Courts <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>cannot go behind the law, but must presume against fact that the legislature acted within the scope of their power. In the one case as well as the other, the legislature have a limited jurisdiction; in case of the land, to grant that which had not previously been granted, and in cases of divorce, to grant them where the power had not been previously granted to the Courts. And the only mode of preserving the Constitution and protecting the rights of individuals in either case is to admit the best evidence, <em>aliunde </em>as from behind the law. Evidence of this kind has been admitted by the Court when the peril to individuals was not so pregnant as here: Austin <em>v. </em>Trustees, <a href="/yeates/1/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="1 Yeates 260" data-case-ids="6773869" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0259-01">1 Yeates, 260</a>; Stoddart <em>v. </em>Smith, 5 Binney, 353; Bolton <em>v. </em>Johns, 5 Barr, 145.</p>
