      <em>Oct. 25. </em>This was ejectment by Jesse King against Samuel Dietz., The facts of the case are fully reported in the opinion of this Court, with the exception of this, that the copy of the record of proceedings in bankruptcy <em>in re </em>Adam Dietz, given in as rebutting evidence by the plaintiff, was certified by the clerk and judge of the District Court, U. S., under date of 2d September, 1848, to be full and entire.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b156-10" data-blocks='[["BL_156.9",156,[307,1653,1185,654]]]'>“ But the proceeding in bankruptcy invested the assignee of Adam with his whole estate, and nothing passed to plaintiff by virtue of his sale under his judgment. The defendant therefore being in possession, is entitled to hold it against every one, except the true owner of the title. It is a rule of law that the plaintiff in ejectment must recover on the strength of his own title, and not on the weakness of that of his adversary; and it makes no difference how unfounded or fraudulent his possession may be, he can maintain it against all but the true owner, or one against whom, for some reason, he is estopped. The defendant here maintains his possession not on account of any virtue in himself, but because of the defect of the plaintiff’s title. Your verdict therefore will bo for the defendant.”</p>

He issued a <em>fi. fa. </em>to Sept. T., 1845, on which the property in question was condemned, and a <em>ven. ex. </em>to Dec. T. following, returned sold to Jesse King for $10.

He further gave in evidence the record of the District Court of the United States, No. 522, Oct. T., 1842, being the petition, &amp;c., of Adam Dietz, of Fayette county, praying for the benefit .of the bankrupt law of 19th August, 1841. The petition and schedule were sworn to on 13th October, 1842, presented and filed 23d January, 1843, and set down for hearing 3d April, 1843. On 26th May, 1843, the petitioner was declared a bankrupt, and R. P. Flenniken, of Uniontown, appointed assignee. On the 23d September, 1845, a petition for discharge and certificate were presented and filed, and the Court appointed 27th November following as the time of hearing. Here the record of the plaintiff ended. It was duly certified by ¿the clerk and judge on 2d September, 1848.</p>

The plaintiff then gave the bankrupt schedule in evidence. The property returned was all personal. The defendant, to meet the plaintiff’s rebutting evidence, offered in evidence the certificate of the final discharge of Dietz as a bankrupt, on 28th November, 1845. The plaintiff objected to the certificate; the objection was overruled by the Court, and this bill of exceptions forms the first alleged error. We think the Court was right in receiving the certificate in evidence. It was dated the day afte&gt; the final hearing was appointed by the District Court. It completed the record of the proceedings in bankruptcy, and whether the clerk did his duty in making the entry of the final discharge on his docket, or neglected it, will not affect the proceedings or the certificate. The Act of Congress encourages looseness in these proceedings, authorizes the clerk to keep short memorandums, and dispenses'.with a full record. The certificate of bankruptcy is made evidence, and can only be impeached in cases of fraud. Congress have made it evidence in all courts of judicature. It is contended that the bankrupt made a fraudulent return in omitting the land in question. I think this is most probably true, but that does not help the plaintiff; for, by section 2 of the bankrupt law, the decree in bankruptcy vests all the bankrupt’s property, real, personal, and mixed, of every name and nature, by operation of the law in the assignee; the decree divested the bankrupt’s estate and vested it <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>
      <em>ipso facto </em>in bis assignee. That decree was made by tbe District Court on 26th 'May, 1843, when Mr. Elenniken was appointed bis trustee. He was tbe person to look after the land in question. Tbe plaintiff’s debt was provable under tbe bankrupt law, and be was entitled to a <em>pro rata </em>dividend. Tbe negligence of tbe assignee in acting did not enable Mr. King to pursue tbe bankrupt’s estate. I apprehend tbe creditors might have bad another assignee appointed, if they bad chosen to attend to it. Tbe able argument of tbe learned counsel of tbe plaintiff would have been well addressed to tbe Congress of tbe United States against tbe passage and loose provisions of tbe bankrupt law; we have no power to remedy tbe crying evils it produced.</p>
