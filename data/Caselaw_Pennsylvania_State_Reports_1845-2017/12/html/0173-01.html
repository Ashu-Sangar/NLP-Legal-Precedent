Walker, deceased, as were concerned in the purchase of the said William’s interest in the premises from A. H. Philson, his administrator. William Gr. W. and the defendant were sons of George Walker, deceased.</p>

William never received a deed for the property, but his father, on several occasions, treated it as though it were his son’s. Once, after having had a survey made, he said he could now go on and make the boys their deeds. At another time, being asked what he would take for certain wood on the land, he said he would have nothing to do with it, it was William’s, or William’s land. William demised the land to a tenant for three years, his father drawing and witnessing the lease. The tenant paid taxes for one year to George Walker, apparently as collector. The land was assessed to William from the time of taking possession to his death; and was once so assessed by his father, acting as assessor. William made improvements of considerable value, and paid the taxes.</p>

That, at another time, William said to his father he <a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>must sell Ms place; he could not get through; when Ms father asked, Where have you a place ? to which William rejoined, Did you not give the rest of the children a place ? To this the father answered, “No; I never gave one of them; if you have a place sell it, but don’t sell mine.” After William went away, Ms father said he-would never give him á title to that place, but that if he did well, he would give him another place. On several occasions William made admissions inconsistent with an assertion of ownership in himself. To the admission of the evidence, mentioned in the first sentence above, the plaintiff excepted. The defendant further proved that George Walker paid large sums towards the improvements made upon the land.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b174-3" data-blocks='[["BL_174.4",174,[310,1006,1182,305]]]'>The plaintiff requested the Court to charge the jury, that if the jury believe that the creditors of William G.

But where facts like these are relied upon to take the case out of the statute of frauds, they ought to be clearly and satisfactorily proved.</p>

The plaintiff relies upon circumstances and upon certain declarations of George Walker. These may be briefly summed up as follows:—1. He allowed William to go into possession, and in conversation called it William’s, once or oftener. 2. After William moved to Berlin, he was still permitted <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>to rent it. 3. When Bare asked the old man for privilege to take some wood off the farm, he referred him to William. 4. He said that he would give William the Long place instead of this one. 5. He said that he would exchange farms with William if he did well in the store. 6. He spoke about having been over to William’s when the barn was building, to show William how to do. 7. George Walker was the collector of taxes, and received taxes from William for the land.</p>

Still less are such things evidence of such a parol sale as a chancellor would decree the specific performance of.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b175-5" data-blocks='[["BL_175.5",175,[139,1225,1195,767]]]'>“ All the facts produced by the plaintiff, and which I have called your attention to, are more than answered by the defendant’s proof of declarations made by William. When asked by a witness for leave to put a toll-gate on the land, William said he had nothing to do with the land, he should go to his father; and the father upon being applied to did point out the spot where it should be built. William said, when the land was assessed to him, that he would pay the taxes, because he thought the rent was worth as much as the taxes, and that if the land was his, he would not take what it was valued at for it. On two different occasions, he told John Watt what amounted to a declaration that he had no title. Peter Walker’^ testimony is still more important; for he proves a conversation between the parties themselves, in which the father roundly denied that he had given his son the farm, and the son did not assert that there had been either sale or gift in the case.</p>

      <em>“ </em>If you are satisfied, by the evidence, as you have heard it from the witnesses, and from the law, as we have laid it down to you, that there was a parol gift of the land in dispute, made by George Walker to his son William, and that William, in pursuance of that gift, went into possession and expended his labour and money in making valuable improvements on it, you may find a verdict in favour of the plaintiff. But it is our duty to say at the same time, that the evidence has made no such impression on the minds of the Court. On the contrary, we think that no claim to land, under a parol gift from a father to his son, has ever been enforced by judi<a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>cial authority in this State, where the proof was not stronger than it is here.

We answer that if any person had gone to George Walker, and told him that he intended to trust William, on the faith that he, William, was the owner of this land, and if George Walker had answered that William was the owner of it, and the other party, believing it, had given him credit, George Walker could never have denied, as against that creditor, that -the fact was as he said. But if the creditors of William took up a false notion that George Walker’s land was William’s, and trusted William on that mere notion of their own, this created no legal, equitable, or moral obligation on George Walker to pay their debts, or to convey this farm for the use of William’s creditors. There is no evidence that any creditor trusted William because he believed him to be the owner of the land. No creditor talked to George Walker about it. There is no reason to doubt that if any person interested had asked him the question, he would have told him frankly the whole truth.”</p>
