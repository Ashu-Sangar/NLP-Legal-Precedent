      <em>Oct- </em>3. This was a <em>scire facias </em>sued out by Thomas Reed against Ezekiel Sankey, with notice to James Dundas, and others, torre tenants, the object of which was to revive the judgment No. 35, October T., 1841, in which Reed was plaintiff and Sankey defendant.</p>

That defendant objected to reviving it amicably to be a lien on any other property than the ‘Boyles Earm,’ of which the judgment was part of the purchase^ money. Plaintiff agreed, and said he wanted the lien on no other property than the ‘Boyles .Earm,’ and was satisfied that that would be good—that defendant expressed himself afraid of'the effect of the revival, with but parol testimony to show the extent of the lien—that witness then commenced to draw a writing, when plaintiff objected, and said that parol testimony would be sufficient against any claim he might have on any other property. Defendant said he would have nothing to do with it, if it was to be continued or made a lien on any other property—said he would keep it off all other property as long as he could, and refused to sign the amicable action and revival, unless plaintiff would agree to release his person and all other property except the ‘Boyles Earm,’ from the lien of the judgment. That plaintiff agreed to release the person and other property of defendant. Plaintiff called a witness, to witness the agreement as aforesaid, and that the defendant then signed the amicable revival.” To this offer the plaintiff objected, and it was rejected by the Court. The verdict was for the plaintiff against defendant and terre tenants, and judg<a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>ment thereupon. In this Court the following error was assigned: —The Court erred in rejecting the offer of defendant to prove the agreement entered into between the plaintiff and defendant, at the time defendant signed the amicable revival, by which defendant was induced to sign it, and also to prove that plaintiff obtained the amicable revival by fraud, or fraudulently attempted to make the lien of his judgment general.</p>

A debt, and a judgment as a security for it, are distinct things; or, to speak more properly, a judgment and the subjects of its grasp are so: and they may be dealt with as such by the parties to be affected by them. But on what evidence can a collateral agreement to separate them be decreed? No statute requires it to be in writing; and if any principle of the common law required it to be so, it would be ground enough to dispense with it that one of the parties had been prevailed on to let the agreement rest on oral evidence by the deceptive professions of the other. The proceedings in this case are informal; but to attain the ends of justice, we must view it as if the terre-tenants hadtakon separate defence; and in that aspect the evidence was. erroneously excluded.</p>
