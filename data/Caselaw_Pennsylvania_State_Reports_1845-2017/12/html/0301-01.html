In 1848, Stewart presented a petition setting forth that he had sold the land to defendant with a covenant warranty, and praying to be substituted as defendant. He further stated that he had not until recently been aware that the case was on the trial list, and that his duties as a member of Congress would prevent his attendance and preparation for the trial at the approaching term. The Court (Gilmore, P. J.) refused the application, and this was assigned for error.</p>

But the petitioner was not a landlord. He was simply a vendor; and not having a reversionary interest, as in McClay <em>v. </em>Benedict, and Boyer <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%2065" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 Watts 65">5 Watts, 65</a>, he was not within either the words or the intent of the statute.</p>
