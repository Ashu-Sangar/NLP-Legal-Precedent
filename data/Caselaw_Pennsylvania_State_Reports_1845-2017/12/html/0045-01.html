In Kirkabaugh <em>v. </em>Dugan, 7 Barr, 394, it is stated when the work was begun and finished.

In that case the contract was joint as to the houses. The intent in the Act of 1836 to confine the lien to each separate building runs all through it, except in sec. 13, in respect to materials. The form of the <em>levari </em>is conclusive.

June 30.—To 38 feet belt sills, &amp;c., at 40 cents, $15.20.” The answer to all this is found in the Act of 1836, and in the statement and bill filed, and supported by numerous decisions: 12 S. &amp; R. 187; <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Rawle%20108" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="5 Rawle 108">5 Rawle, 108</a>; Shaw <em>v. </em>Barnes, 5 Barr, 20; 7 Barr, 394.
