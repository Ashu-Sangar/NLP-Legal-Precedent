These receipts he had given Keith, who caused them to be presented to Huidekoper as early as 1837, and the deed demanded. This was refused because one of 'the receipts for $85 was not considered as given on account of this contract. It was in these words:</p>

In 1819, Neal, acting as the agent of the Company, had undertaken to procure a conveyance of the interest of Shattuck and Peck to Stewart for this land, on his paying the price. In 1827 the interest of Shattuck and Peck had been surrendered to the Land Company.</p>

But it was also in proof that Stewart was under the impression for along time that the payment had been credited on his original contract, and that when he discovered the mistake he endeavoured unsuccessfully to have it corrected.</p>

This right did not exist until Huidekoper refused to make the deed on presentation of the receipts, and that was known to plaintiff. If, then, after that, plaintiff was induced to wait and make another trial with Huidekoper, by the suggestion and at the instance of defendant, the statute would not begin to run until such further reference was known to him, or was requested to demand it by defendant, and omitted to do so for an unreasonable time; hence we assent to defendant’s position and dissent from the plaintiff’s, except in defendant’s conclusion, which would be too much of an infringement upon your privileges to find what the evidence satisfies you the facts are.”</p>

If the receipts ought to have brought the deed, that is enough. That they ought is clear. There was but one contract between Stewart and Shattuck, the receiver of the money, to be applied to Stewart’s contract in terms. On the other contract, Stewart was to pay Shattuck nothing. The <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>declarations did not suspend the statute. There was no acknowledgment or promise, but a mere assertion, amounting to no more than that the receipts ought to be applied to the contract.</p>

Both are equally defined by the words of the receipt, and the payment has been applied by the receiver. How then can it be changed by proof of a mere intention in the payer ? Hence, as there were no receipts given which entitled the plaintiff to a deed, he could reclaim his purchase-money. The reiterated declarations of the defendant were sufficient to induce the plaintiff to wait and make another trial, and until then the statute did not begin to run.</p>

The only contract between the parties was the assignment of the articles of agreement between Jared Shattuck, who it appears was the agent of Huidekoper, and Simeon Stewart, for the sale and purchase of a tract of land.</p>
    <p id="b241-6" data-blocks='[["BL_241.10",241,[138,1343,1194,251]]]'>Stewart assigned the contract, and at the time of the assignment and at other times said the receipts for payment, when presented to Huidekoper, would bring a deed. He gave over to Keith the receipts at the time of the assignment. Keith went into possession of the land, which he still retains.</p>
    <p id="b241-7" data-blocks='[["BL_241.11",241,[140,1605,1189,354]]]'>The evidence is very strong that the receipts do entitle Keith to a deed. One receipt of eighty-five dollars, which Shattuck gave to Stewart for the land he had purchased in part, was applied by Shat-tuck and Huidekoper to a previous purchase, made by Stewart and Peck, <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">(a)</a> and this is the receipt about which the difficulty occurs. It ought to be applied according to its terms, and that is on the purchase made by Stewart himself.</p>
    <p id="b241-8" data-blocks='[["BL_241.12",241,[134,1967,1193,304]],["BL_242.1",242,[327,376,1189,151]]]'>There was no covenant or warranty that Huidekoper would make a deed when the receipts were presented. Who would undertake to guaranty or stand over the whims and caprices of any man ? The fair meaning of the words invariably used by Stewart, “ that the receipts would bring a deed,” is, that they would entitle Keith to a deed. Keith did present the receipts, at which time this diffi<a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>culty was made by Huidekoper—that the receipt for $85 was applied to a contract long anterior, made by Peck and Stewart, and that by the mere volition of Shattuck or Huidekoper.</p>
    <p id="b242-3" data-blocks='[["BL_242.4",242,[325,536,1191,665]]]'>Keith did not then deliver up possession of the land to Stewart, or offer to do it, and demand or elect to rescind the contract. But he kept possession,. and wore out a saw-mill; and now, after the lapse of a great many years, he seeks to recover back the money and rescind the contract, without even offering to reassign the contract or deliver up possession. This he cannot do; he has by no means entitled himself to rescind that assignment at his volition. The best thing he can do is to let Huidekoper bring his action; or, he may bring his own action on the’ contract, to compel a deed; and if Huidekoper shows that the receipts will not entitle Keith to a deed, then he will have his remedy over against Stewart. This he ought to have done long ago. The Court therefore erred in answering the first point of the plaintiff in the affirmative.</p>
    <p id="b242-4" data-blocks='[["BL_242.5",242,[320,1209,1193,717]]]'>The Court ought to have answered the defendant’s fifth point in the affirmative. The statute of limitations commences to run from the time action has accrued, according to the plaintiff’s claim or showing. If he had any cause of action at all, it accrued when he presented the article assigned to him and the receipts, and Huidekoper refused to make the deed. There was nothing said or done afterwards by Stewart, which would lift away the bar of the statute. It was proved that he said afterwards, and that he said a few days before the trial, that the receipts would bring a deed. This showed the sense in which he understood that expression; that is, that in law they would bring a deed or entitle Keith to one. He knew, long before that time, that Huidekoper had refused to make one voluntarily, but he still believed that they fairly, justly, and lawfully entitled Keith to the deed.</p>
    <p id="b242-5" data-blocks='[["BL_242.6",242,[320,1933,1188,148]]]'>The fourth point of the defendant ought to have been answered in the affirmative. It will both explain and illustrate itself in connexion with the foregoing remarks.</p>
