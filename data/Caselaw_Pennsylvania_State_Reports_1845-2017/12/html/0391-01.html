The defendants objected to the admission of the deposition, upon the ground that the first interrogatory was not answered; and that the reason given by the witness for not answering, showed that he did not know in what cause he was under examination. The Court overruled the objection.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b393-4" data-blocks='[["BL_393.4",393,[116,495,1197,1474]]]'>It was disputed on the trial whether there was any evidence of a loss by the perils of the sea. The plaintiff gave evidence to show that the jewelry was shipped in good condition, and was properly stowed. It appeared that the vessel sailed about the 16th December, 1827, and arrived at Havana about the 2d of January, 1828. No account of the occurrences of the voyage was given. A survey, on stowage was made on the 10th of January, when the surveyor found that the wooden box containing the jewelry was stowed in the cabin in the transom locker, and was wet, and on opening the box he found that the jewelry, which he did not take out of the box, was much damaged by wet at the top. On a place in the deck over the box being pointed out to him, where it was said there had been a leak, he found it was wet. There were jugs and ship stores in the locker with the box. It also appeared that the jewelry was examined in the custom-house at Havana, between the 10th and 17th of January, 1828, when the whole of it was found to be much damaged by salt water. It further appeared that the Nueva Eloísa was, on the 11th October, 1827, registered in the marine register of the defendants, as A. No. 2, new caulked and in complete order; that a vessel like the Nueva Eloísa never stands above A. No. 2; that on the 9th and 12th of December, her cabin was repaired by a ship-joiner; and that sometime in 1828 a person who purchased her had to careen her. A vessel which arrived at Havana from Philadelphia about three days before the Nueva Eloísa, had “ strong northerly winds almost all the way out.” Evidence was also given that the working of the rudder tended to loosen vessels at the stern. The learned judge left it to the jury to say whether there was a loss by the perils of the sea, which was excepted to and assigned as error.</p>

De Bolle, to the use of Ms assignees, William Vineyard and Joseph Fleming, against the <em>defendants; </em>the trial notes of the judge who tried that cause, and the report of it in 4 Wharton’s Reports, 68. On the trial of the former action, two objections had been made to a recovery, viz. 1. That the suit should have been in the name of Joseph Fleming, and, 2. That no evidence had been given to show that Fleming, when he procured the policy, intended it for the bene<a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>fit of De Bolle. The judge (Sergeant), gave no opinion on the first objection, but sustained the second one, and instructed the jury to find for the defendants, which they did. The Supreme Court in banc, on the motion for a new trial, sustained both objections, and judgment was entered on the verdict. Several depositions taken under commissions issued in that action, were read by the plaintiff in the present case, upon the ground that they had been taken in a former cause between the same parties, to recover for the same loss; but the learned judge ruled that the plaintiff was not barred by a former recovery, and this was excepted to and assigned for error.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b394-3" data-blocks='[["BL_394.4",394,[334,895,1184,661]]]'>The jewelry had been purchased by De Bolle, but it appeared that it was <em>“ </em>consigned” by him to one Quevedo, in Havana, and the defendants requested the judge to charge the jury that the property in the goods was to be presumed from this fact to be in the consignee. But the learned judge instructed the jury to inquire whether De Bolle was the owner of the property, and instructed them that <em>“ </em>the mere consignment of property for the benefit of the owner, vests a right of action in the consignee, because, by the consignment, he has a special property in the goods, but that the general property still remains in the owner, unless he has sold .the goods; and he has such a property as will enable him to sustain suit in the name of the person who effects the policy for his use.” This instruction was excepted to, and assigned for error.</p>
