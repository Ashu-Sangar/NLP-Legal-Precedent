Was there any rent accruing from the defendant to his landlord subsequent to the sale ? [His Honour here stated the case.] It is ruled in the case of the Bank <em>v. </em>Ege, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20436" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="7 Watts 436">7 Watts, 436</a>, that a purchaser of real estate at the sheriff’s sale in the middle of a term is not entitled to the rent payable by the tenant, if by the terms of the lease the same was payable in advance at the beginning of the year.</p>

The consideration was valued, there was no money or grain to be given to the landlord by the tenant, and it was on this condition that the field was farmed. No rent accrued to Shauffer subsequent to the acknowledgment of the sheriff’s deed, and it was properly ruled that the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover.</p>
