      <em>Oct. </em>3. This was an amicable action in ease, between Hopewell as plaintiff and Independence as defendant, in which a case was stated for the opinion of the Court, exhibiting the following facts.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b92-11" data-blocks='[["BL_92.10",92,[316,1518,1193,497]]]'>In October, 1848, the <em>then </em>township of Hopewell was divided into the two townships, litigant here. Nine years before that division there came into Hopewell a woman, who brought with her a small boy, whom she called her son. After remaining a few days at the house of one Mary Bigham, in the territory of what is <em>now </em>called Hopewell, the boy was badly burned, and became chargeable as a pauper for present relief. No information could be obtained, as to the boy’s place of legal settlement, and he, continuing necessitous and being blind, has remained a charge on Hopewell ever since.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b92-12" data-blocks='[["BL_92.11",92,[319,2034,1180,352]]]'>Another pauper, named Rutherford, who was a charge upon the old township of Hopewell, before and at the time of the division, became so chargeable in 1847, when he resided-in Pittsburgh, where he had not gained a settlement, and at that time came back into that part of the old township now called Hopewell. He had resided in the same territory before, at the time of gaining his last place of legal settlement in the old township.</p>

The charge was on the whole of the old townships, and upon all the inhabitants, and neither of the new townships is exonerated by the division.

The principle established by them is, that a settlement has a local habitation in respect to the township itself, and that the fragment of territory into which it falls is to maintain the pauper, whether he had been chargeable to the parent township or not. There was to be no contribution to subsequent maintenance, in any case, as there had been by the words of the Act of 1803, which were purposely omitted. It appears in the case stated, that the blind boy was an actual charge on the original township; and that the place of his residence, while gaining what may be called his settlement for present relief, was in what is now the new township of Hopewell. The fragment cut off is consequently to maintain him, as did the townvship of which it was an integrant; and the same thing may be said of the pauper Rutherford. He, too, was properly charged to the new township of Hopewell.</p>
