It may be admitted that according to Fetherston and Hutchinson’s case, 3 Leon, 208, that if one of the considerations be unlawful, the whole contract is void: see <a href="/mass/8/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Mass. 51" data-case-ids="2028566" data-case-paths="/mass/8/0048-01">8 Mass. 51</a>; <a href="/watts-serg/2/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 235" data-case-ids="1853528" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0235-01">2 W. &amp; S. 235</a>; but here is no unlawful consideration. To forbear to do what the law did not allow, is not unlawful; nor is the promise to forbear, <em>urilatoful. </em>All that can be said of it, is, that it is <em>frivolous; </em>that it is no consideration at all, and would not support an assumpsit. There are then two considerations for defendant’s promise, and one of them is frivolous and invalid, and the other good. In such case the promise is clearly binding. In Bradburne <em>v. </em>Bradburne, Cro. El. 149, it was held, that ‘ where there are divers considerations alleged by the plaintiff, and some are frivolous and void: yet, if <em>any </em>of them be good, the plaintiff shall recover.’ So also, in Pikard <em>v. </em>Cottels, Yelv. 56. See also, <a href="/mass/8/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Mass. 51" data-case-ids="2028566" data-case-paths="/mass/8/0048-01">8 Mass. 51</a>, per Sedgwick, J.; Best and Jolly’s case, 1 Sid. 38.</p>

      <em>“ </em>2. As to the mode of proceeding in case of a promise to pay an old debt, a great deal of confusion has prevailed. That the new promise should ever have been held to <em>revive </em>the-old debt, so as to enable the plaintiff to declare on the original indebtedness, seems a perfect anomaly to the legal mind, and probably arose from the struggle of the Courts to avoid the effect of the statute of limitations. The statute of limitations being a general law, the Courts ought to have taken notice of it officially, as they did of all other general laws, and when the plaintiff declared on a promise of more than six years’ standing, and the defendant demurred, they should <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>have given judgment for the defendant. But instead of this natural course, they put the defendant to plead the statute, as if it had been a private one for his especial benefit, and when he <em>did </em>plead it, so odious was it, they permitted the plaintiff to abandon the promise declared on, and rest upon a new and distinct one, within six years, of which the old indebtedness was only the consideration. This anomaly is perhaps now too firmly rooted to be eradicated. But the absurdity of allowing a promise to revive a debt, absolutely extinguished by a release or by a certificate of bankruptcy, is too gross to be tolerated. The proper mode of proceeding in such a case, is to declare on the new promise, as is done in the case before the Court. This principle I consider settled in Pennsylvania by Field’s case, <a href="/rawle/2/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Rawle 351" data-case-ids="1820625" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0351-01">2 Rawle, 351</a>, and Earnest <em>v. </em>Parke, <a href="/rawle/4/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Rawle 452" data-case-ids="1823523" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0452-01">4 Rawle, 452</a>. After the defendant’s discharge, the plaintiff could not possibly proceed against him on his judgment; and even if there had been no discharge, and the parties had accounted together, blending the judgment note and book account together and striking the balance due, and defendant had promised to pay that balance, the plaintiff might, according to the principles settled in Gibson <em>v. </em>Stewart, <a href="/watts/7/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 Watts 100" data-case-ids="1846829" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0100-01">7 Watts, 100</a>, have maintained assumpsit on such promise, and recovered the whole balance due. We think, therefore, that judgment must be entered for the plaintiff on the demurrer.”</p>

Nor was there any sufficient consideration laid; for at the date of 'the promise a <em>capias </em>could not lawfully issue, as the right was abolished in 1842, and had already been destroyed by the bankrupt discharge: <a href="/watts/7/0203-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="7 Watts 203" data-case-ids="1846867" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0203-01">7 Watts, 203</a>; 13 S. &amp; R. 294; <a href="/cow/5/0195-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="5 Cow. 195" data-case-ids="2032755" data-case-paths="/cow/5/0195-01">5 Cow. 195</a>. It is also apparent that the promise was procured by the threats of duress. The indebtedness having ceased by the bankruptcy, no consideration remained but the moral obligation, and that is not laid as a consideration. But even that is merely thrown in to give additional weight to the consideration previously laid,—being partially illegal, the whole is vitiated.</p>
