Defendants owning the land above the plaintiff on this stream, have a right to the reasonable and necessary use of the water running in it for a mill, unless it <em>be </em>taken and used or shut off hy them so as to materially destroy the privileges and rights of plaintiff below.

The elaborate opinion of Mr. Justice Rogers, pronounced on deliberation, is sound in every particular. That case is like the present, and the only difference is that Hay’s grist-mill had a possession on the stream upwards of thirty years before Sterrett’s saw-mill was constructed. In that case it was established that the mere prior occupation of a stream of water for the purposes of a mill, will not vest such an exclusive right to the occupant as to enable him to maintain an action against a person who erected a mill and dam above his, by which the water is in part impeded, and he in some degree injured. Every riparian owner is entitled to use the flow of water through his land, although the owner of a mill below may be in some measure injured thereby.</p>

It is not enough to establish such a right, that the water had been accustomed to flow uninterruptedly through the land above for any length of time. An improper or malicious use of the water through the land above, gives a right of action to the owner of a mill below, who is injured thereby. The Court there affirmed the instruction to the jury, that if the injury to the plaintiff’s mill arose from the detention of the water in Sterrett’s dam for its ordinary and proper use for mill purposes, it was <em>damnum absque injuriá, </em>and the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>
