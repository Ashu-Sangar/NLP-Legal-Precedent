The bond is well taken in the name of the judge.\nIn error from the Common Pleas of Greene,\nSmith having been arrested on a warrant granted tinder the Act of 1842, gave bond with the other defendants as sureties to the judge to appear before him on the 9th of February, to answer a certain complaint made by, &c., for fraud, &c., under the Act of 1842, and to abide the decision made in the premises.\nOn the 9th of February, Smith appeared, and the cause was adjourned to the 17th. \u2018 On that day the cause was adjourned for want of his appearance until March, when the judge declared the allegations proved, hut that he could not commit Smith, as he had not appeared.\nDebt having been brought on the bond, Gilmore, P.
