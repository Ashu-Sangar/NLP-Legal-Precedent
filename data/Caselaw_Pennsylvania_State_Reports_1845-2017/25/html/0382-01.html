In 1851, James Wade, the defendant, being engaged in erecting a mill, to which he designed to apply both water and steam power, engaged Haycock to perform the millwright work for him, at a stipulated price. Haycock professed to be a practical millwright. Before the work -was completed he left, hut procured another millwright to proceed with the work and finish it. In the mean time Wade gave Haycock the note in controversy, dated the 16th March, 1852, for the sum of $320, payable 1st April, 1852, that being the amount of the work as stipulated in the contract. When the work was finished it was found to operate imperfectly, and the mill had to be stopped for several weeks, and a portion of the machinery was removed, and others substituted by Wade.</p>
