On the 29th day of April, 1828, Archibald Stewart, Sr., the father of the parties, was the owner of a tract of land of about 400 acres, of which this land in controversy was a part. On that day he made and executed his will, by which he divided the tract among his family. To his son Archibald he devised 100 acres and allowance to be laid off on the south side of the tract. To the defendant he gave 100 acres and allowance to be laid off to him on the north end of the farm, adjoining lands of Johnson and others, to include the buildings then occupied hy defendant. The residue of the tract he devised to his wife Eleanor in fee. Archibald Stewart, the testator, died in March, 1831. The widow, by her will, dated 4th July, 1831, devised her portion of the tract to the plaintiffs. In 1827, Samuel Stewart, the defendant, went into possession of the land he now occupies, including the land in dispute, under a gift from, or by permission of, his father, and continued in the actual occupancy of it until the trial of <em>this </em>suit.</p>

Samuel was present, and assisted in the survey, and his part contained 107 acres and 8 perches, and allowance. . The widow did not assent to this division, and died shortly after it was made.</p>

He held adversely to all the world, when he claimed to hold it <em>as his own. </em>Suppose him to have been in error that the devise covered the disputed part, his possession would be equally good. The fact that he entered by permission of his father in 1827, does not change the application of the rule. His possession at least commenced to be adverse at the father’s death in 1831. The Court should at least have submitted the question to the jury. His occupancy, limitation of his boundary by the fences, and the coincident occupancy on the other side, were a constant and continuing assertion of adverse and hostile possession.

Why should he not be protected by the statute of limitations ? The plaintiffs, who are his brother and sisters, answer that it was part of their father’s land, of which their mother was the devisee, and they afterwards got it by her will.</p>
    <p id="b237-6" data-blocks='[["BL_237.5",237,[141,688,1164,384]]]'>Archibald Stewart, the father of all the parties, owned four hundred acres, which he devised in separate portions to his two sons and his wife. The present defendant was in possession of the one hundred acres, which he now has, at the time of his father’s death, and from that time to the present, he has asserted that the one hundred acres given him in his father’s will, was this same piece. The plaintiffs insist that the land actually devised to him does not include the part in dispute, but other land of much less value, which he never claimed.</p>
    <p id="b237-7" data-blocks='[["BL_237.6",237,[138,1076,1167,514]]]'>When a devisee goes into the possession of land, claiming it under the devise, and beeps it undisturbed for twenty-one years, he has a title to it which nobody can question. If other devisees or heirs think he has taken too much land, or taken it in the wrong place, they must make their claim before the statute runs over it, or else not make it at all. After such a lapse of time, the law will presume that it was designated and marked off to him by the other parties interested. They cannot demand a' new apportionment, even if his possession has been inconsistent with the devise, much less can they do so when the description in the will is merely ambiguous. His possession for twenty-one years is as good as their deed.</p>
    <p id="b237-8" data-blocks='[["BL_237.7",237,[138,1591,1166,507]]]'>But, in the present case, the defendant had taken possession before his father’s death, probably under one of those gifts which parents frequently make to their children in anticipation of their testamentary arrangements. The Court seemed to think that this fact would take the case out of the general rule above laid down. We are not of that opinion. His keeping possession of the land in dispute and claiming it under his father’s will, was an act of hostility against the other devisees, as distinct as anything he could have done. If he claimed it as devisee, he claimed it as his own, and if he claimed it as his own, that claim was surely adverse to them as well as all the rest of the world. It would not have been more so if he had held it under a deed from his father.</p>

It does not matter much what they were, if the defendant has been in the adverse possession for twenty-one years.</p>
