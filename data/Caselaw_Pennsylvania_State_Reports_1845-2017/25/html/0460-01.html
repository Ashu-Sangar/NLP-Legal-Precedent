It was admitted that the title to the land in controversy had been in David Kelly — that the plaintiff, Leah Kelly, was his mother and sole surviving parent, and that David Kelly died without issue, but leaving his mother, Leah Kelly, and brothers and sisters, of whom the defendant, Samuel Kelly, was one. Defendant, to support the issue on his part, gave in evidence the record of the will of David Kelly as follows, to wit:—</p>

That the witness told David Kelly that the will written by him so divided his estate, and that David Kelly, after reading it, said he believed it so expressed his desire and signed the will. That witness never drew a will before, and only consented to do it in this instance at the urgent request of the testator, and because no other person could be got to do it. Witness was confused at the time, and may not have expressed'the direction of testator as clearly as under less embarrassing circumstances he might have done. Defendant- also offers to prove that the testator in his lifetime often declared his intention to divide all his property to the defendant, thus to aid in showing clearly that the word “ balance” in the will refers to testator’s estate, also to prove that Samuel Kelly was testator’s brother, and the plaintiff, his mother, and John Montgomery, a nephew, in ill health and since dead; which offer was objected to on the part of plaintiff.</p>

But we think the offer in this case is, in effect, to introduce an important word, such as land, property, or estate, into the will, and that extrinsic evidence of the testator is not admissible for that purpose. Therefore, the offer of defendant is overruled, and, at the request of the defendant’s counsel, this bill of exception is noted.”</p>

The evidence <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>offered to explain the ambiguity caused by the wording of the will should have been received. The ambiguity is caused by the wopds “balance” and “it,” — it is an ambiguity that can only be explained by testimony, and the defendant’s offer shows what the character and intention of the testator were. To remove a latent ambiguity the testator’s acts and declarations in respect to the thing given are certainly admitted: Brownfield <em>v. </em>Brownfield, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Jones%20136" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Jones 136">2 <em>Jones </em>136</a>; Verner <em>v. </em>Henry, <a href="/watts/6/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts 139" data-case-ids="1846062" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0139-01">6 <em>Watts </em>139</a>; Smith <em>v. </em>Bell, <a href="/us/31/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Pet. 68" data-case-ids="1439702" data-case-paths="/us/31/0068-01">6 <em>Peters </em>68</a>. The offer is to show what was bequeathed. The words “balance” and “it” mean something, and that something can be explained by evidence which defendant offered -to prove — and the will further gives to his mother and John Montgomery their maintenance out of <em>it </em>— out of what ? This can be explained by evidence, and can only be by the declarations and act of the testator. The scrivener was illiterate, not accustomed to drawing wills, hence it is done in a bungling manner.</p>

The bequest gives all the balance of something to his brother Samuel, and his mother and Montgomery to have their maintenance of it. Out of what were they to have their maintenance ? certainly out of the estate, both real and personal. The intention of the testator that his mother and Montgomery shall have their maintenance out of his property, and his brother Samuel is to have the balance of it, is perfectly clear; and the devise must not be declared void where a reasonable interpretation can be put on it: Smith <em>v. </em>Bell, <a href="/us/31/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Pet. 68" data-case-ids="1439702" data-case-paths="/us/31/0068-01">6 <em>Peters </em>68</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Dallas%20264" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Dallas 264">2 <em>Dallas </em>264</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Binn.%20149" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Binn. 149">3 <em>Binn. </em>149</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Yeates%20508" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Yeates 508">1 <em>Yeates </em>508</a>.</p>
