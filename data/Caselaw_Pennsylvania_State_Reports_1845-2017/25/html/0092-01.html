At law the appointment of a debtor executor was a discharge of the debt: 11 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>146. But our -Act of 24th February,. 1834, keeps alive a valid claim, and directs each debt to be. included in the inventory. Nor does the appointment and acceptance of the office by the debtor suspend the remedy: the 22d section provides that no executor shall be compelled to <em>pay </em>for one year. But in• this' there is no suspension; the creditor may have his action though he may not compel payment for a year.</p>
