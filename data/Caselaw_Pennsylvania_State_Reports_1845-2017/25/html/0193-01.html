The defendant pleaded entry and eviction by the plaintiff, and the rent estopped, upon which issue was joined. And on the trial of the case, the following facts appeared in evidence. On the 13th day of June, 1853, the plaintiff leased to the defendant a ferry on the Allegheny river, called “the Sharpsburg Ferry,” together with the boats, appurtenances, and privileges — a house and the piece of ground, attached thereto, for and during the period of five years from the 14th day of June, 1853. For which the defendant covenanted to pay the yearly rent of $475 in quarterly payments. The defendant entered into possession in pursuance of the lease. On the 14th day of August, 1854, Linton sold a part of the land embraced in the lease to the Allegheny Yalley Bailroad Company, and agreed to release the said company from all damages by reason of the location and construction of their railroad. Under this agreement the railroad company entered into the premises purchased, and constructed their road, and in such manner, as defendant alleged, as to greatly interfere with his use and enjoyment of the ferry, and so as to impede and obstruct the road to and from the same.</p>

The law is well Settled, that if the lessor wrongfully enters upon a part of the demised premises, and evicts the tenant, the whole of the ensuing rent is thereby suspended. Is then the plaintiff liable for the consequences of the entry and eviction made by the railroad company, under his agreement of the 19th of September, 1853 ? Looking to the terms of the agreement, it seems to me that he must be considered as having authorized the entry on the demised premises, and that he is to be visited with all the consequences of the eviction in the same manner as he would be if he had himself entered and evicted the defendant. The only question of fact for the determination of the jury is, when did the railroad company enter and evict the defendant from a portion of the demised premises? Was it during and before the expiration of the quarter ending the 14th of September, 1854? If before that date, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. If it was after ,the 14th of September, 1854, when the rent demanded became due, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover.</p>

The acts of Linton were not an eviction, and did not suspend the rent for the whole of the premises, or prevent an apportionment of it. The defendant was still in possession of the ferry.

But the owner of a reversion has a right to sell the whole or any part of it. Such right is incident to the right of property, and necessary to the full enjoyment of it. The exercise of it is not wrongful, and therefore, in the case of a sale of a part of the reversion, the law will apportion the rent; and the right of apportionment attaches the moment the sale is made. No action of the purchaser, or his aiders and abetters, in dispossessing the tenant of the part purchased, after such severance can have any effect upon the rent growing out of the unsold part remaining in his undisturbed possession. It matters not that the original reversioner, after such severance, becomes a party to the trespass by aiding his vendee in committing it. The trespass has relation only to the part sold, and cannot be visited upon the other part of 'the premises. These principles are fully affirmed in Reed <em>v. </em>Ward, 10 <em>Harris </em>144. If this be the law in the case of a sale voluntarily made for the mere convenience of the reversioner, it applies with much greater reason to a sale made under compulsion to a railroad corporation having authority from the Commonwealth to take the property for the purposes of the road without the consent of the owner. In such a case there is no reason for visiting the reversioner with the consequences of a trespass committed by the corporation. It had no right to take the estate of the tenant without compensation given or secured. The sale of the reversioner’s interest in the part so taken conferred no-such: right, and the tenant has an ample remedy, for the injury without depriving his landlord of the just .portion of rent due for the premises enjoyed under the lease.</p>
