And as to his daughter Mary, ordered that she should, “ in case of need, be supported in a comfortable manner of the proceeds of my (his) land, so long as she shall live.” The devisees entered upon and took possession of the land severally devised to them, in pursuance of the said devise. The interest of John was sold at sheriff’s sale, and became vested in Thomas Gibson, the appellant, who was in possession of the same.</p>

Indeed the answer does not deny that it is a charge. The ground of defence which the respondent has taken on the record is, that the complainant does not need a maintenance out of this land, having other means of support. This was a question of fact, to try which an issue might have been ordered. But none was demanded. The matter was left to the Court, and being determined by the Court, it is as binding on us as if it had been found in the same way by a jury. We may add, however, that the construction given to the will, the adjudication upon the evidence, and the shape of the decree, have our entire approbation.</p>
