It is because the writ is founded upon the recognisance that it cannot be arbitrated; and why depart from the plain language of the law ?</p>

True, the arbitration Act of 1836, in defining what actions may be thus referred, excepts “ actions upon bail-bonds or <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>recognisances;” but the commissioners who reported the Act, say that they intended only to embody the principles already decided by the courts, and we have no doubt they were so understood. It is not allowed on bail-bonds and recognisances for the appearance of parties, because they must be subject to the usual equitable relief by the Court: 6 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>542; 3 <em>Pa. Ref. </em>396 ; but it is allowed on a recognisance of bail in error : <a href="/watts/3/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Watts 176" data-case-ids="1841277" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0176-01">3 <em>Watts </em>176</a>; and on a forfeited insolvent bond: <a href="/watts/6/0324-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Watts 324" data-case-ids="1846106" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0324-01">6 <em>Watts </em>324</a>; because they are subject to no such relief. A recognisance of bail for stay of execution falls within this last reason. The record raises no other question.</p>
