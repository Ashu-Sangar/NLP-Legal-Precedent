On the 26th of July, 1853, by an order of relief of. two justices of the peace, she became chargeable on the township of Cumberland. Shortly after its receipt the overseers of the poor of the latter township applied to two justices and procured an order of removal to Jefferson township, where it was alleged was her legal settlement. From this order of removal the township of Jefferson appealed. The record in the case returned by the justices was as follows:—</p>

The parties appeared at the above-named place, and proceeded to hear the testimony, and after hearing the parties, their proofs and allegations, we do adjudge that the last legal settlement of Ann West is the township of Jefferson, therefore we grant an order of removal to remove the said Ann West from the township of Cumberland to the township of Jefferson.” ' ■</p>

We were anxious to sustain the order of removal, as we are satisfied from the evidence that the pauper had a settlement in Jefferson; but it is nowhere alleged in the order of removal, although it is in substance in the order of relief that she was a pauper, or likely to become chargeable. The 19th section of the Act of 13th June, 1836, is but a transcript, with slight alterations of phraseology, of the 23d section of the Act of 9th March, 1771, and notwithstanding the power to amend defects of form given in this section, it was ruled in the case of the Overseers of Dromore <em>v. </em>Overseers of Hanover, <a href="/yeates/1/0365-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Yeates 366" data-case-ids="6775152" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0365-01">1 <em>Yeates </em>366</a>, that the adjudication must show that the pauper had or was likely to become a charge.

Was this an incurable defect in the order of removal ? The 19th section of the Act of 13th June, 1836, relating to the poor, provides that on appeal from an order of removal, <em>if there he any defect of form in such order the Court of Quarter Sessions shall cause the same to he amended without cost to the party ; and after such amendment, if the same he necessary, shall proceed to hear and determine the cause upon its truth and merits. </em>This remedial provision in aid of a jurisdiction of great importance, but which is often unskilfully exercised, is entitled to a liberal construction. It was intended to bring pauper cases to a speedy decision on their very merits, and to save the poor, whom we are always to have with us, from the agonizing suspense of protracted litigation about technicalities and forms.</p>
    <p id="b465-7" data-blocks='[["BL_465.8",465,[162,1418,1170,559]]]'>It is undoubtedly necessary that a pauper before he is removable should have become or be likely to become chargeable to the district which undertakes to remove him, for unless this be the case justices have no jurisdiction, and for want of jurisdiction an order of removal will be quashed; but, when he has been made chargeable by due process of law, may not a defective order be amended so as to exhibit the fact ? We have no doubt of it. The two justices, before the appeal, might have amended their order by reciting the order of relief which the overseers before them held, and which was conclusive evidence of the chargeableness of this pauper, and an amendment which they might properly have made before appeal, the Quarter Sessions were bound to allow after appeal.</p>
