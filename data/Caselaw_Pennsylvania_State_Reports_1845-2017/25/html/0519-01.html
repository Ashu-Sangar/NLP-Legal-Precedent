Dorney is the owner of a tract of land in South ‘ Whitehall township, Lehigh county, lying on Cedar Creek; and the defendant owns a tract of 23 acres adjoining the plaintiff below, on which are erected a grist-mill and the dam in question. Both parties traced their titles back for many years. The mill and dam were first built more than seventy-five years ago, and came into the possession of the defendant but a few years ago. In 1853, he tore down the mill and built a new one upon the same site, and repaired the dam. The leakages of the dam had also been repaired by the owner in 1836.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b520-6" data-blocks='[["BL_520.4",520,[306,908,1162,128]]]'>It was alleged by the plaintiff, on the trial in the Court below, that the defendant had raised the dam, by which the water was swelled further back upon his land than formerly.</p>

J.) charged the jury as follows : — “ No one has the right to swell water or increase the swell of water on the land of another without permission. The evidence of such a permission is either, first, by grant; or second, by twenty-one years’ user; ending within twenty-one years before suit brought. Twenty-one years’ peaceable continuous user of a road, or of a flow of water on another’s land, gives a right. This right may, after it is acquired, be lost by twenty-one years’ interruption or abandonment. An omission of the user for less than twenty-one <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>years does not destroy the right. Merely raising or tightening the fabric of the dam, works of itself no damage to plaintiff unless the water is thereby swelled upon his land more than the defendant had permission, by express grant, or by twenty-one years’ user. The second point of the defendant is answered in the negative.</p>
