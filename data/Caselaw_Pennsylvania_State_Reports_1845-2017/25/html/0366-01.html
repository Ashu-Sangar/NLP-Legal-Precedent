The cause of the fire was.unknown. The hatches were closed down, and preparations made for getting up steam and injecting it into the hold, by means of apparatus provided for that purpose, and also water was introduced by means of hose. In about an hour after the discovery of the fire, the steam-pipes were brought into play, and turned into the interior of the boat, where they continued to operate for fourteen hours or more. The fire, however, still making progress, and the officers of the boat believing there was no other possible means of saving the boat and cargo, determined, after consultation among themselves, and with various other persons, upon the expedient of scuttling her. They accordingly ran the boat out into the river, about two miles from the wharf, and there sunk her on a bar. A portion of the deck was torn up, and water introduced from above, and by these means the fire was subdued and extinguished. In a few hours afterwards, the boat was raised and taken back, with the remnant of the cargo, to Cincinnati, where the cargo was sold. The cargo was injured to about seventy-five per cent, of its value, and the boat and cargo, together, to the value of about twenty-five per cent, of their entire value.</p>

And, while it maybe doubted, perhaps, whether our law-of-aver age was in fact derived from the Romans, it is very plain -that the Roman law on this subject has had great influence in moulding and defining that of all- modern commercial nations. The- equity of the rule is so obvious to natural reason, that it may very well be supposed that the practice might grow up Spontaneously, wherever naval commerce existed. The name average, given to it in nearly all European languages,-would seem to strengthen this supposition, for this is not at all of Roman origin; and a modern Latin word, <em>avaria, </em>had to be invented to expfess it, as the word <em>contributio </em>did not express the same idea.

An analysis 'of the cases very plainly reveals three things as the elements of general average: a purpose,- a means, and a result; a design to avert a common danger <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>by a sacrifice voluntarily made, and a successful issue. The first and the last are perfectly definite in their character, while the means must always remain to be defined by the rule of prudence when the danger arises.</p>
    <p id="b373-6" data-blocks='[["BL_373.5",373,[128,588,1171,809]]]'>Guided by the light of the rule and its instances, we feel constrained to say that when a vessel or its cargo takes fire without the fault of the crew, the damage done by the application of water or steam in extinguishing the fire, and by tearing up part of the vessel in order to get at it, is general average. The danger is a common one, and the cost of the remedy must be common. It makes no difference how the water is applied: by the aid of fire-engines on the land, or in the form of steam, or by scuttling the vessel. All these modes were tried in this case before the success-was complete. They are all to be treated together, because they all referred to the same peril. They were the means employed for the purpose of averting the danger in which they were placed. It was a sacrifice for the common safety, for it was intentionally injuring or destroying all that part of the cargo that could be thus affected by water, in order to save the rest. The result was successful if a single article w'as saved by the means employed. Without attempting to follow the counsel in their minute criticism upon the charge to the jury, we may say that it was entirely correct.</p>
