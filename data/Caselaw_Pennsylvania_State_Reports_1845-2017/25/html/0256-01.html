No affidavit or statement of claim, or copy of the bond secured by the mortgage, was, filed. There was nothing to designate the character and amount of the plaintiffs’ claim, except the usual reference to the record of the mortgage, recorded in the Recorder’s Office of Allegheny county, in the Mortgage Book, volume 25, page 165. The mortgage, as correctly recited in the writ, purports to have been executed on the, 21sfr day of September, 1853, by Kennedy and his wife to Ross, to secure upon the property of Mrs. Kennedy <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>the payment of her husband’s bond in Ross’s favour of even date therewith, in the penal “sum of $3000 conditioned for the payment of $1500 in three annual payments, with interest thereon from the 1st day of May, 1853, together with other conditions as therein more fully set forth.” It is further provided in the mortgage that “ in case of default in the payment of the principal sums and interest as aforesaid, or any part thereof, for the space of thirty days from the time they or any of them shall become due, thereupon it shall be lawful for the said mortgagee, or his legal representatives, to sue out forthwith a writ or writs of <em>scire facias, </em>upon the present indenture of mortgage, with the same force and effect as if twelve months next ensuing the last days wherein the principal money hereby secured ought to be paid according to the condition of the above recited obligation, had fully run out and expired, any usage or practice to the contrary notwithstanding. ’ ’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b257-6" data-blocks='[["BL_257.5",257,[161,1118,1170,599]]]'>On the 5th of June, 1854, the writ of <em>scire facias </em>was returned “ served on defendant by a copy left at his residence with his wife.” On the 9th of December, judgment was entered in default of an appearance and affidavit of defence, and a <em>levari facias </em>issued, upon which the property was advertised. A rule was obtained to show cause why the judgment should not be set aside. The Court granted leave to the sheriff to amend the return of service, but made the rule absolute, and set aside the judgment. The plaintiff afterwards obtained a rule on the defendant to show cause why judgment should not be entered for want of an affidavit of defence. This rule was made absolute on the 3d day of March, 1855, and the amount liquidated at $1485.53. The following was the condition of the bond, to secure the payment of which the mortgage had been given:—</p>

The Court erred in entering judgment in favour of the plaintiff, inasmuch as by his own showing, the first annual payment of the debt, secured by the mortgage, was not due until the 21st of September, 1854, and he therefore had no cause of action on the 3d June, 1854, the date of the impetration of his writ.</p>

By the terms of the bond, recited in the mortgage and writ, the first annual instalment was not due until the 21st September, 1854. If, therefore, the plaintiff, on his own showing, had no cause of action against the defendants when he brought suit, it would certainly have been a work of supererogation on their part to file an affidavit of defence. In the case of Thomas <em>v. </em>Shoemaker, 6 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>183, suit was brought on a negotiable note, before the last day of grace had expired, and judgment was entered, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence; and, on error to this Court, where the objection was first raised, it was held that it was error in the Court below to enter judgment in favour of a plaintiff, who, by his own showing, had no cause of action at the time he commenced suit.</p>

In this case the filing the deposition of Mr. Robb with the copy of the bond, fully explains any ambiguity that might be conceived in the phraseology of the reference to it in the mortgage. And the simple question is, and should be, was there <em>actually </em>a default at the time of issuing the <em>sci. fa. </em>A default occurred May 1. In thirty days from that time the mortgagee had a right to issue a <em>sci. fa. </em>It was not issued till June 3, 1854, and consequently after the expiration of the thirty days.</p>

It is there provided that the $1500, with interest from <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>the 1st day of May last, is to be paid in three equal annual instalments <em>from that date, </em>interest payable on the whole sum annually. That date, first of May last, was first of May, 1853; and consequently, on the first May, 1854, an instalment of the ■principal and all the interest fell due. Thirty days thereafter, by virtue of the conditions in the mortgage, the plaintiff was entitled to his <em>scire </em>facias; and hence his writ, sued out June 3,1854, was not premature, but after cause of action accrued. Construing the terms in the mortgage agreeably to those in the bond, the <em>sei. fa. </em>disclosed a good cause of action, and the defendants should have put in an affidavit of defence if they had any to allege.</p>
