But tbe two petitions did not call for the same road. They bad a common starting point, but tbe terminus of the one was “ tbe dividing line of lands of Isaac 0. Alderfer and Abraham 0. Alderfer,” whilst that of tbe other was “ upon lands of Isaac 0. Alderfer, at a point between Alderfer’s School-house and said turnpike-road in tbe township of Lower Salford aforesaid.”</p>

Tbis alteration was a material one, and disproves the identity of tbe two roads prayed for. As tbe roads were different, tbe Court of Quarter Sessions bad a discretionary power to appoint tbe second set of viewers, and we have no doubt it was properly exercised, but, whether it was or not, we cannot review it.</p>
