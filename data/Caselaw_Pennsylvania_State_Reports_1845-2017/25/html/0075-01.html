    <p class="summary" id="b75-11" data-blocks='[["BL_75.10",75,[172,1456,1172,644]]]'>This suit was originally brought by Hamilton township against the defendant, before a justice of the peace, for the recovery of a bond or contract signed by defendant (and a surety not named), dated 25th June, 1850. The defendant had contracted to make about 200 rods of a new road for plaintiffs, at 72 cents per rod. No money was to be paid until the job was completed. The road commissioners, however, agreed to advance to the defendant $40 of funds they had on hand, and required him to give the above bond with surety, which was conditioned for making the road according to the contract: in that event the $40 to be deducted from the amount to be paid him, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue. Defendant did some $50 worth of work on the road, and then finding it more expensive than he expected, abandoned and never completed it. And this suit was brought to recover the $40 thus advanced.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b75-12" data-blocks='[["BL_75.11",75,[175,2103,1170,214]]]'>The bond was made payable to Libby, McManus, and Stanton, Hoad Commissioners of Hamilton township. And when offered in evidence, the defendant objected to its being read in this suit, brought in the name of Hamilton township as above stated, which was overruled, and the bond was read.</p>
