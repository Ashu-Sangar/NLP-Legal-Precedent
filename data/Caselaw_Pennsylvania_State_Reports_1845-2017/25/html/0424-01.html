In 1846, the cause was on the trial list, and a verdict taken for defendant by default. This was set aside by the Court, and, in May, 1848, the cause came on again for trial and resulted in a verdict and judgment for the defendant, which was affirmed in the Supreme Court. Robinson had notice of the pendency of the suit, and assisted in preparing and conducting the defence.</p>

James S. Craft, Esq., was called and testified, that he was employed by Bakewell to defend the ejectment, and that Bakewell had paid him $1000 for his services. That the value of the property, at the time’ of trial, was not less than $10,000. On his crosá-examination Mr. Craft stated, that Robinson and Tassey had entered their appearance to the ejectment, and when he discovered it he deemed it an incautious movement, as bringing the contest between Eliza Wilkins and Robinson, in which event he thought the defence would have been unavailable; and added, “I told them what seemed to be the difficulty, and begged them not to interfere. I think .Robinson then left the case to us.” The defendant’s counsel then proposed to ask the witness, how much he had paid his counsel in certain ejectments which had been brought against him. The Court overruled the question, on the ground that the witness had previously stated that his counsel, in the cases referred to, had not charged him the usual fees on the ground of professional courtesy. The plaintiff further proved, by Judge Shaler, who was counsel for Eliza Wilkins, in the ejectment referred to, that Mr. Craft’s services were, in his opinion, worth $1000.</p>
