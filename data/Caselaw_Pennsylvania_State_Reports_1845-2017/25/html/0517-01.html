Heilner and Percival Heilner confessed a judgment to John Brock for the use of Samuel Heilner, John Brock, Sons &amp; Co., on the 5th of August, 1853, for the sum of $32,700, payable on demand. <em>A. fieri facias </em>was issued and a levy and sale made of the personal property of the Heilners, consisting principally of property used at the coalmines on the premises leased by them as hereinafter stated. The defendants in the foregoing judgment and execution were coal operators, and on the 24th of June, 1846, had leased from Anthony F. Miller and Jacob Hoffman, a tract of coal land containing about 500 acres, for the term of 20 years, for the purpose of mining, at the rate of 35 cents per ton, payable monthly. The lessees covehanted to “ mine and take out not less than 32,000 tons of coal from the veins of said tract in each and every year during the term of the lease.” And in case of failure were to pay for that number of tons, unless the veins should prove faulty, with an option in the lessors to forfeit in case of failure; .the lease also contained a right of distress for rent in arrear. The lessees took possession, and on the 10th of February, 1851, a supplemental lease was made, by which the quantity was increased from 32,000 to 50,000 tons, and the rent was reduced’ from 35 to 27 cents per ton. After the execution of this supplemental lease, Jacob Hoffman conveyed his interest in the land, and assigned his interest in the lease to Benjamin Tyson, A. M. Sallade and H. H. Muhlenberg. And Anthony F. Miller conveyed a portion of his interest in the land and lease to H. A. Muhlenberg, since deceased.</p>

Heilner and Percival Heilner, issued a <em>ft. fa. </em>thereon* and-sold the personal estate of the defendants for $10,180. This money being brought into Court, the above-named plaintiffs in1 error appeared and claimed it' as landlords of the defendants'in the execution on account of a year’s rent due to them under’ certain coal leases, and suggested to the Court, says the record* “ <em>that the facts whether the said rent or any.part thereof is due, and-also whether, if due, the said claimants are.entitled to-receive the same out of </em>the- <em>proceeds of the sale, are'disputed.” </em>Issues were, thereupon awarded to' try these'facts j but-they were never formed.</p>

There were no parties and1 no pleadings, but the suggestion made by the landlords- seems to have been' considered substantially an issue between them and the <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>plaintiffs in the execution. Two questions were suggested — one of pure fact, whether there was any rent due; and the other a mixed question of law and fact, whether, if there were rent due, the claimants were entitled to recover it out-of the proceeds of the sale; — and the Court proceeded to try these questions upon the evidence. But, after admitting the evidence, they declined to charge the jury upon the effect of it, as requested in several points put by the counsel of the landlords, and directed a verdict for the plaintiffs in the execution. The whole case was thus withdrawn from the jury, and no fact whatever was established.</p>

Neither in form nor in substance have they been passed on. The whole purpose of an issue was that the jury might find the facts; but this the Court prevented by refusing to submit them. It is obvious, then, that the record is in no condition to receive our judgment of the law. The loose, indeterminate, and unskilful character of these proceedings brings to mind forcibly the condemnatory observations of Chief Justice Gibson in Shultz’s Appeal, 1 <em>Barr </em>254, where it was said, we are “ confounded by the rude and undigested mass in which the proceedings are sent to us.”</p>
