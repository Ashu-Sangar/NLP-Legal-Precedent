He deadened some trees and commenced the building of a cabin, but had no residence or cultivation on the land. In 1805, Sally Cook, a single woman, entered upon the land, and, with the aid of her brothers, commenced a resident settlement upon the land — built a cabin — cleared land and resided upon the tract. In October of the same year she was forcibly driven off by Parker, He then sold 100 acres, including his own and Sally Cook’s improvement, to James Platt, who sowed some grain, in the fall, which he harvested the following summer and took it away. Sally Cook instituted a- prosecution against Parker for forcible entry and detainer, which w;as to be tried in September, 1806. On the 16th of September, 1806, the matter was compromised between them, by which she relinquished all claim to the land except 50 acres, and gave up the prosecution, and; Parker agreed to procure the title from the Commonwealth, and convey to her 50 acres adjoining Daniel Cook, he to pay the costs, <em>&amp;e.</em>

On the 13th of June, 1836, Witherup conveyed his interest, being two-thirds, to George Kribbs, one of the defendants in this suit. Parker sold his third of the land to William McCall, it being severed from the rest of the land, and had been surveyed and patented. On the 6th of July, 18¿6, Kribbs procured a warrant, and had the land surveyed, including the 50 acres which had been allotted to Sally Cook, and took a patent for it.

It is said, however, that the defendants are not in possession of the fifty acres, do not claim it, and have expressed a willingness to convey that quantity to the plaintiffs — but that is not a sufficient answer under any circumstances disclosed in the evidence. They have made an entire survey including the residence and possession of the plaintiffs, and without their consent, and without even making a record of their right in the land office, taking out a patent from the Commonwealth covering the whole tract. This is such an ouster as will entitle the plaintiffs to a verdict for the fifty acres at least, or for a verdict to be released on making a good title to the fifty acres within a reasonable time. If the agreements of September, 1806, were obtained from Sally Cook by the fraud of her counsel, and Witherup concerned in it — and she and her husband continued the possession under that delusion; transferred their entire right to Downing, and he continued to act under the same delusion, and under misrepresentations of Witherup, and has made no new agreement of his own, or adopted and recognised none such as his own, — if Witherup obtained the right of Hunter with knowledge of the wrong practised upon Sally Cook and her husband, Keely, and upon Downing afterwards, the possession of Downing, or his heirs on the land was sufficient to put Kribbs upon notice, and-he would <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>take the right, subject to all its infirmities, and the plaintiffs would be entitled to a verdict without any conditions, on the principle, of Hunter <em>v. </em>Howard, in 10 <em>,Ser. </em>¿f- <em>Ii. </em>If, however, Downing purchased only fifty acres, and afterwards got a survey stating that Witherup was owner or to be the owner on certain conditions, give it in for assessment, agreeing of himself that Witherup was to take out the title for the whole, and he to be the owper of part, all under one residence, settlement, survey, &amp;c., and this all fair and understood between Witherup and Downing, then the recovery might be confined to the fifty acres by a conditional verdict, as already suggested. If, again, the. agreement was fraudulent as regards Hunter particularly, the counsel of Sally Cook, and he induced the agreement, at the same time taking an interest in it. himself, Hunter would stand as trustee for his client, Sally Cook, and the interest transferred to him would really belong to her. If this were so did Witherup know it, or was he hound to take notice of it ? The plaintiffs say there is evidence of this in the transfer from Hunter to him in the peculiar wording of this instrument. There is some force in this, and you may take it into consideration. If, besides this, Downing acted in mistake of his rights, in his acts and declarations in relation to Witherup’s claim; if, added to this, there was unreasonable delay on the part of Witherup. in performing the agreement for Parker in paying the. purchase-money and perfecting the title, and finally, the defendants (the plaintiffs having no opportunity of ascertaining the true state of the land) took out the title from under the plaintiffs in. their own name without consulting them, and without their consent, the jury might find a verdict for the plaintiffs to be released, on making and filing of record within a reasonable time, a deed from the patent not for the fifty acres alone, but for so much more as the interest of Hunter would amount to, if the evidence justify that conclusion upon the principles stated, designating it in such manner as to be certainly ascertained, and on payment of the costs of suit. The plaintiffs were entitled as the settlers to have the legal title in their own name, or to be known in the application of record, or in some way to have the portion they were entitled to, secured before the title-papers were taken out of the office. No deed has yet been given or tendered to them, and their equities can bé thus secured by a conditional verdict.”</p>

It is wholly impossible for us to rely, with the least confidence, on the very small amount and imperfect character of the evidence which can now be given of it. Death has disarmed the accused parties of the power of self-defence, and closed the lips of the witnesses who might have testified in their favour. After such a lapse of time no owner of land can be called on to answer a charge impugning his title in that way. If he could, where would be the security of property ? When a person, against whom a fraud has been perpetrated, lies by for twenty-one years without causing it to be investigated, he will not then be permitted to show it.
