That the life estate was willed to her without question, and if any estate was given to her, it depended upon her own act in exercising the power she had under the will.

In this case if a fee is raised it must be by implication, and this is rebutted by the express words, and contradicted by the limited estate; and the words, “ and the disposal of the one-half at her pleasure,” is but a naked power connected with the life estate, and shows an intention to place it in the alternative. But the bequest of a life estate would not conflict with the conveyance under the power of an estate in the proceeds of one-half of the realty; for one is realty, the other personalty. '</p>

She is to have <em>all </em>for life, and the disposal of <em>one-half; </em>and this discloses the intention not to include the <em>one-half </em>in the limitation, but to except it from the previous clause devising <em>all </em>for life. And there is nothing inconsistent in the devise of the fee in one-half, and a life estate in all. The general power of disposal does t not follow an express limitation, as in all the cases cited by counsel ; but it is a part of the phrase giving the limitation itself, and hence cannot be applied to the whole property.</p>

It is obvious the testator intended to distribute his estate into three parts, viz., a life estate to Eleanor, and the remainder to be equally divided between his wife and children; and by joining these two gifts, the disposal of one-half to her, and the other to them, it is evident he intended more than a power — a disposition of all the parts, and not of two only, with a power to her to appoint the other.</p>
