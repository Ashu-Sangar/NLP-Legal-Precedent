Reed was guardian. Shortly after the death of Jacob Schaeffer, difficulties occurred in the administration of his estate, growing out of claims which he held against his daughters, and of demands which they made upon his estate. To enable the administrator to settle, the heirs signed the following agreements:</p>

It is understood that this authority embraces all claims held by the estate against Mrs. Ringland, for notes given .by her to her father, or claims against her paid by him, which claims said administrator is to adjust and dispose of as to him may seem just and equitable.</p>

Mary Ringland’s guardian alleged that Jacob Schaeffer, in his lifetime, had been the guardian of Mary, and that in right of her father, who was deceased, she was entitled to $3000 in Natchez, which had been lost through the intestate’s neglect. Mrs. Thompson and her husband made a claim, the amount of which did not very distinctly appear, for various services rendered to her father. In pursuance of the agreements above recited, the administrator delivered up to Mr. Reed, the guardian of Mary Ringland, the claims he held against her mother, and also the claims against Mrs. Thompson and her husband; they at the same time relinquishing their claims against the estate. The administrator filed his account, showing a balance in his hands of $8203.38, which was confirmed by the Orphans’ Court in February, 1854; and at the May Term following, an auditor was appointed to make distribution. Before the auditor, the appellant contended that Mary Ringland should be charged with the several claims which the intestate had held against her mother, Charlotte Ringland, and which the administrator had delivered up. The appellees relied upon the agreement^, and the settlements made by the administrator in pursuance of them.</p>

The appellant, who is one of the distributees, sought to charge him in his account with certain obligations and notes given up by him and cancelled. The Court refused to permit it, and we think rightly, for this most conclusive reason: The obliga<a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a>tions and claims in question were disputed, and their justice denied <em>by </em>another member of the family. To save a contest unseemly and disagreeable, the appellant, as well as the other distributees, agreed in writing that the administrator should settle them on such terms as should seem most desirable to him. He did so by giving up the claims. It is not doubted that he acted in good faith, or that he cancelled the notes because he thought they had already been paid. But the appellee thinks that she ought to be permitted to charge him notwithstanding, on the ground that his act was wrong, and that he was merely an arbitrator between the heirs, with his authority revoked at the time his award was made. He was not an arbitrator. In settling or compromising the dispute he was in the line of his duty as an administrator, and the paper which the heirs gave him was sufficient to protect him from responsibility for an error of judgment.</p>
