The interest Lyon then held was the title to the tract from the Commonwealth, and this was bound by plaintiff’s judgment, if the title had not been divested by Lyon’s deed to Patterson of July 13, 1831, in trust (as above stated). This deed limited the power of Patterson to sell in execution of the trust to two years, and he not having executed the power for near fifteen years, the land would he subject to levy and sale by the creditors of Lyon. But Mr. Bellas holding as trustee for Lyon, or Lyon redeeming the tax title within two years, the title never was divested by the tax sale.</p>

The purchase by Bellas for Lyon at treasurer’s sale did not operate as a redemption, if the position of defendants be true that Lyon had no interest in the <em>land, </em>but only to the <em>surplus </em>reserved to him upon a sale under the deed of trust. If Lyon had no title, or but an imperfect one, what was there to prevent him from becoming the purchaser at treasurer’s sale ? He did not purchase the Reed and Kreighbaum title, but the <em>land </em>itself.</p>

After the expiration of the two years limited for the sale of the tract in dispute under the deed of trust, the trustee had no power to sell, and the time limited for the execution of the trust having expired, the deed conveyed no title. The deed of trust was fraudulent on its face, in limiting the surplus, after payment of the debt specified to the grantor. The object was to cover the property.</p>

The trust created by the deed was a subsisting continuing trust. No length of time can be a bar to a <em>direct </em>trust, and the privity existing between the trustee and the <em>cestuique trust </em>makes the possession of the one the possession of the other: 24 <em>Law Library </em>310. The failure to sell in two years could not operate a forfeiture or abandonment of the trust estate. An assignment for the benefit of creditors, once accepted by the assignee, is vested for their benefit, and a subsequent renunciation by the grantee does not affect the validity of the conveyance: Klapp’s Assignees <em>v. </em>Shirk, 1 <em>Harris </em>592. The trust was fair and valid at its inception, and was a fraud on no one, much less on plaintiff, whose claim did not commence till 1837. Its terms were not for all creditors <em>in futuro, </em>but for payment of a specified debt; and the only parties having interest in it were, Lyon the grantor, the trustee Patterson, and the <em>cestui que trust, </em>the Miners’ Bank.</p>

Mr. Bellas proves no more than a general agency for Lyon, and not specific, for the purchase of the land in question, and the payment of the purchase-money to him by the bank is fully proved. The deed of Bellas to the bank, Lyon, and Patterson, shows the understanding of the parties at the time, and this was before the period allowed for redemption had elapsed, and the conveyance was, in effect, a redemption: 9 <em>Harris </em>480.</p>
