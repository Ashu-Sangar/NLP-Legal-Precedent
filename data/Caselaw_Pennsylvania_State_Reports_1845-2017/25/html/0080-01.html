On the 10th December, 1852, a rule was entered to show cause why the satisfaction should not be stricken off; and on the 7th May, on the hearing of the case, the court ordered a <em>scire facias </em>to issue, to determine if the judgment had been paid or not. On the trial the defendant relied upon the plaintiff’s receipt above mentioned; and the plaintiff, to rebut this, read in evidence an assignment of the original judgment, dated March 9, 1851, and filed in the case 7th May, 1858, from Philip Bashline to Samuel .Johnson; and proved by 0. Brown, that he wrote the assignment from Bashline to Johnson, and told Guthrie of the assignment, but did not recollect distinctly the time he had told him.</p>

It is not necessary that direct notice of the assignment be given by the assignee or his agent. It is sufficient if the information be given under circumstances and in terms calculated to arrest the attention of the debtor. In this case the knowledge was acquired during the trial of the cause in which the justice of the demand was the matter in controversy, and it was communicated by the person who had drawn the assignment and witnessed its execution. This was sufficient, although the transfer was not filed of record. The omission to file it might turn the scale in favour of a subsequent purchaser of the judgment who had no notice of it: Fisher <em>v. </em>Knox, 1 <em>Harris </em>622. But the payment to Bashline, after full knowledge that he had no right to the money, was an act of bad faith, which is not to be justified by such omission. Actual knowledge of the transfer was more effective in guarding the defendant against a mispayment than the filing of the instrument of record without notice.</p>
