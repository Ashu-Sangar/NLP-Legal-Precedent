Patton had been the administrator of Joseph Minesinger, a son of plaintiff; and settled his account, in which a balance of $1612.16 was ascertained to be in his hands. This suit was brought to recover a balance due, part of the above-stated sum. On the trial the defendants produced several receipts, the last of which was dated on the 11th September, 1847, and was for the sum of $100. They alleged that the entire balance had been paid by Samuel Patton in his lifetime, for which no receipts were taken; or, if taken at the time, that they were lost.</p>

This was objected to by plaintiff’s counsel, and rejected by the Court; to which defendant excepted.</p>
