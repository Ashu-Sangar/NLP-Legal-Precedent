Mrs. Rowen employed a man by the name of Garrison Smith to attend to the suit as her agent, and he employed counsel to appear before the justice and make <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>defence. On the day of appearance Smith, and the counsel of Mrs. Rowen, and the plaintiffs and their counsel, appeared before the justice. After some proceedings and convérsation among the parties it ivas stated that judgment should be entered for the defendant. Her counsel then retired, but ascertained afterwards that Smith had confessed a judgment against the defendant for $93.95. He applied to the justice to open the judgment, which was refused, and the defendant then appealed. The appeal was entered in the Common Pleas on the 20th January, 1855, to February term; On the 27th August, 1855, at the third term after the appeal, a rule was granted 'to show cause why the appeal should not be quashed; which rule was made absolute on the 18th September following. To reinstate the appeal this writ was sued out by the defendant below.</p>

It has never, yet been decided that it makes any difference whether the judgment was obtained by confession or otherwise. A judgment may be confessed by mistake, or in consequence of imposition, or it may be done fraudulently by a corrupt agent. In such case, what is the remedy, and how shall justice be reached ? <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>The justice is not bound by tbe statute to open tbe judgment, and a <em>certiorari </em>would be of no avail. If the wronged party discovers bis situation in time to appeal, he ought not to be turned out of Court. When tbe judgment is confessed by tbe defendant in person, it is evidence that tbe debt is just, and may be proved for that purpose. But no admission of a debt can be strong enough to preclude tbe party from showing that it was made in ignorance of bis rights. Much less can tbe admission of an agent have that effect.</p>
