It is not admitted by the parties; the jury did not pass upon it, and the Court could not. <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>What does it matter whether the plaintiff or defendant was right on the law, since there is not a fact found to which it refers ?
