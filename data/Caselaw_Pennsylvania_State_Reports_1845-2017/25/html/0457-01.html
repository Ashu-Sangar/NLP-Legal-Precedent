There is nothing about lien in it. That is regulated by other provisions. But if a creditor means' to enforce his lien, if he intends to charge the lands of the decedent, he shall bring in the widow and heirs, and for what ? Not to contest his lien, but his debt; to demonstrate, if they can, that the decedent owed him nothing, and that, for <em>this </em>reason, he has no right to pursue the decedent’s real estate. Debts, when established, are a lien; but, since the Act of 1834, they must be established against widows and heirs, as well as personal representatives, before they can be levied on real estate, and hence their right to contest the claim on original grounds, whether sued with the personal representatives, or brought in afterward by seirefaeias: 8 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>165; 2 <em>Barr </em>112; 9 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>16. That a purchaser takes no estate where this rule has been disregarded, has been decided in many cases, and in McCraken <em>v. </em>Roberts, 7 <em>Harris </em>395, was a conceded point. The estate in that case, as here, was devised subject to payment of debts. That is generally the case, but to assume the existence <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>of the debt, which the statute says shall be proved, and then to argue that the will devised only what remained after the payment of debts, is to sacrifice the statute to a <em>petitio principii.</em>
