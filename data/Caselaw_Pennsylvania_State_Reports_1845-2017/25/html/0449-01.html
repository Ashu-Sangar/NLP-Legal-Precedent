Eitenour or order, amounting in all to §557, and assigned by Eitenour to John W. Lynch. These notes were given by Weaver to Eitenour in part payment of a tract of land purchased from Eitenour on the 80th of April, 1849. At the time of the purchase there was a judgment against Eitenour, which was a lien on the land; upon which a <em>scire facias </em>was afterwards issued and Weaver summoned as terre tenant, and judgment entered thereon on the 12th of June, 1852, for §614.77, which remained unsatisfied.</p>

I called upon Mr. Weaver, to arrange the matter — to give bail for the money — that he could not pay the money — but would give bail in two weeks. Lwas to give to the middle of March, if he would, satisfy me that the money would come without suit — men that would be prompt — said he was not prepared for it on that day — but would give in a couple of weeks. He said that Lynch had proposed the same thing to him — said they were all right but §105 or §106 which he had paid as a credit on the notes. Never saw him till November 3, after the presidential election. He <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>then refused to go into the arrangement, that there was a judgment in favour of Brownfield.

I asked him if he had not said to him, Weaver, that if there was to be any quarrelling about it, he wanted to know it, that he could return them to Ritenour.

The defence was that the farm was encumbered. It is not denied that this would have been an answer to the suit if the notes had remained in the hands of the original holder. But the Court held, on certain facts to be mentioned presently, that the defendant was estopped from setting it up against the assignee.</p>
    <p id="b451-13" data-blocks='[["BL_451.14",451,[173,1459,1166,644]]]'>It is a rule as well settled as it is just, that if an obligor induce a person to take an assignment of his note or bond by admitting the justice of the debt, or declaring that he has no defence, he cannot afterwards deny it to the prejudice of the assignee. But, in order to create this equitable estoppel, it is necessary for the assignee to show not only that he took the assignment, but 'that he paid a valuable consideration for it. If the law were otherwise, an ignorant obligor might easily be trapped into an admission, and a sham assignment might be made for the very purpose of keeping out an honest defence. The assignee must also be able to show that the admission was made <em>before </em>he expended his money in procuring the assignment. Anything said afterwards can do him no harm, because it could not be his motive for making the purchase, and therefore it shall not affect the other party by way of estoppel.</p>
    <p id="b451-14" data-blocks='[["BL_451.15",451,[173,2104,1165,170]]]'>In this case there was no evidence to show what consideration was paid for the notes by the assignee, nor whether any at all was given. This made the plaintiff’s evidence on that part of the case fatally defective.</p>

The assignee does not appear to have called on the defendant, or to have heard anything from him about the notes, until after the date of the assignment. Then, however, he told the defendant that he could return the notes and <a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>would do so if they were not right, and he received for answer that they <em>were </em>right. If he had proved that he had them conditionally, with the privilege of returning or keeping them according to his own pleasure, and that he had decided to keep them after the defendant gave him this answer, that would be a complete estoppel. But his mere averment, in a conversation with the defendant, that such was the condition of things, is not sufficient evidence to prove it.</p>
