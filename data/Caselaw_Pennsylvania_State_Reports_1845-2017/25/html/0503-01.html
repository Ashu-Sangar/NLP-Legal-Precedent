The barn complained of as a nuisance was built on the land conveyed by the Penns in 1841, by S. M. Barclay, who was then the owner of the land, and adjacent to the springs. He died, and by his will devised this land to S. M. Barclay, one of the defendants in this prosecution, and other children of Dr. E. B. Barclay.

The verdict is conclusive of these facts, and the Court was right in ordering the nuisance to be abated.</p>

The defendant was acquitted on the first count, which charged the <em>barn </em>with being a nuisance, and was convicted only on the second count, wherein the erection of the barn is alleged by way of inducement to the offence, which is described as putting hay, straw, and other products of the farm in said barn, and keeping horses, mules, cattle, and other animals in and about said barn, and in the yard adjacent thereto, and feeding the said cattle, horses, and other animals with the aforesaid hay and straw and other products in said barn, and in the said yard near to the aforesaid springs, &amp;c. The offence laid in this count consisted in the <em>use </em>made of the barn and yard in close proximity to the springs, and the nuisance would be effectually abated by discontinuing such use. Where an erection or structure itself constitutes the nuisance, as where it is put up in a public street, its demolition or removal is necessary to the abatement of the nuisance; but where the offence consists in a wrongful use of a building, harmless in itself, the remedy is to stop such use, not to tear down or remove the building itself. The barn may be used for storing hay and grain without annoyance to the public, but for stabling and feeding cattle it cannot be. The public are entitled to pure waters from the springs in question, and must be protected in the enjoyment of this right. The Court should take effectual measures to prevent the barn and yard from being used in the manner complained of, and to compel the defendant to put <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>and keep them in such condition as will not corrupt the springs. If he fail to do so after being sentenced, the sheriff should be ordered to do- it at his costs; and if necessary, the Court can restrain further wrongdoing on the part of the defendant, by requiring him to find security to be of good behaviour.</p>
