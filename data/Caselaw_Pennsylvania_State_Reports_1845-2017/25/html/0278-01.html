Elizabeth was married to Timmans, and Jane, in 1796 or 1797, to Henry Church. Lazarus Timmans and wife sold their part of the land to a man by the name of James Morris, who died shortly after, and before any conveyance was made to him. Morris, and Church in right of his wife, made a partition of the land, by which the part in dispute was allotted to Jane Church in severalty. On the 16th February, 1799, Church and wife, and Timmans and wife, joined in a conveyance to Joseph Archer, who was the uncle of Elizabeth and Jane. This deed was absolute upon its face, but the plaintiffs alleged that it had been made for the more convenient patenting' of the land, and that Archer held it but as a trustee. The deed was alleged to be lost, and secondary evidence of <em>its </em>contents was given. The plaintiffs also alleged that Jane Church was a minor at the time she executed the deed, which was a disputed fact in the cause. Joseph Archer, on the 25th of August, 1800, took out a patent for the land which contained the following recital: “ The said Lazarus Timmans and Elizabeth his wife, and Henry Church and Jane his wife, by deed dated 16th February, 1799, conveyed the above described tract of land to the said Joseph Archer, to whom a warrant of the acceptance of the said survey issued 28th October, 1799.” It was alleged that Joseph Archer had exchanged a tract of land lying below Waynesburg, with Henry Church for this land, which Church afterwards <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>sold to a man <em>by </em>the name of Porter, hut his wife did not join in the conveyance. On the 4th April, 1813, Joseph Archer conveyed the land in dispute to James Hook, who, on the 10th April, 1815, conveyed the same to John Craig; and on the 2d of March, 1826, John Craig and wife conveyed it to Henry Church for the consideration of $1800. Recorded 10th October, 1836. Jane Church had several children, some of whom are the plaintiffs in this suit. She died in 18Í6. Henry Church was married a second time, and had children by his second wife, to whom he devised the land, and who are defendants in this action. He died in 1851.</p>

We see no good reason why the principle recognised in answer to the previous points should not be extended to Henry Church, who, in case the deed was in trust, was a <em>co-cestui c[ue trust </em>with his wife, Jane Church. But we charge you that if he purchased back the original trust property, by means which he <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>had derived from a sale or exchange of the trust property, he can by no means be considered an innocent purchaser unaffected by the trust, and this will be the case whether these means were derived mediately or immediately from this source. We mean by this that if this deed was a trust deed, and Henry Church after-wards participated in violation of the trust by receiving in exchange the property east of town for the trust property, and afterwards sold this property, and realized the price of it to an amount sufficient, or nearly so, to pay for the land in dispute, he, Church, must then be considered as holding this property subject to the original trust; and this will be the case, although the jury should believe that money derived from other sources had been used in the repurchase of the land in dispute. It is sufficient if he had sold the exchange land and realized the price, and that to an amount sufficient, or nearly so, to pay for the repurchased property. There is no evidence here what the exchange property was sold to Porter for; but there is evidence that when the property was exchanged, the property in dispute was valued at ¿£50 more than the property east of town.</p>

He might do homage to the lord without joining his wife. He may appoint an attorney for both in actions brought against them in respect to the land of his wife : 7 <em>Harris </em>410; 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>127. His interest in the estate, and his power over it, imposes upon him the duty of protecting and defending it. Like joint tenants, tenants in common, and tenants in dower, he is prohibited from doing anything to the injury of those who have a common interest with him in the title. Neither can purchase an outstanding title against the other. With equal, if not greater reason, each is prohibited from doing any act by which the estate of the other may be unjustly defeated. It follows from these principles that if the deed of 16th February, 1799, from Henry Church and Jane his wife to Joseph Archer, was merely a conveyance in trust, to enable Archer to take out a patent for the use of the grantors; and, if Henry Church afterwards, instead of enforcing the due execution of the trust, participated in the breach of it, by which the estate was conveyed to Hook without notice of the trust, for a consideration beneficial to Church himself, it was an act of bad faith which rendered him liable in equity to make restitution. It is true that the estate itself could not be taken from a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser without notice of the trust. Nor could it be defeated in the hands of a purchaser with notice from one who had bought without. But if the original violator of a trust repossesses himself of an estate thus conveyed, the original equity will reattach to it in his hands: 1 <em>Story’s Eq. </em>§ 410; <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>1 <em>Sch. &amp; Lefroy </em>379; Bovey v. Smith, 1 <em>Vernon </em>60; s. c. <em>Id. </em>84; 1 <em>Cruise Dig. </em>tit. 12, ch. 4, § 12. The husband who aids in the violation of a trust for his wife, upon a consideration of profit to himself, stands in the same predicament. Although Henry Church was a <em>cestui que trust </em>to the extent of his own interest, his power over his wife, and his interest and power over her estate, placed him in the relation of a trustee for her to the extent of her interest. In a case of this kind, it matters not whether the consideration received for violating the trust was equal to that paid on the repurchase of the estate, or whether the repurchase was made with the profits arising from the original wrong, or with other funds. In either case the moment the estate came back into the hands of the wrongdoer the original equity reattached. In this view of the case, it is plain that the instruction given on the question under consideration did the plaintiffs in error no injury. It was quite as favourable as they had a right to require.</p>
