Before the sale to Colver, four judgments were had against Patterson, which were liens upon the land, the last of which had been entered on the 8th April, 1858. And several judgments were obtained against him after the said sale in favour of M’Nealy and others, a further description of which is unnecessary, the only question in the case arising out of the judgments entered <em>before </em>and those entered <em>after </em>the said sale to Colver.</p>

The sale was of all Patterson’s interest in the land, and the fund must be appropriated to the judgments in the order in which they stood against him, whether they are liens on the fee simple or fee defeasible, as all claim as the creditors of Patterson, whose interest was sold: see 9 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>397; 16 Ser. <em>&amp; R. </em>20,294; <a href="/watts/2/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Watts 373" data-case-ids="1840074" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0373-01">2 <em>Watts </em>373</a>.

The interest in the vendee may be separately sold on execution, leaving the legal estate and the equitable estate unpaid for, untouched in the vendor, and a judgment against the latter binds the legal estate but to the value of the purchase-money, and just so much can be levied on and sold, and a purchaser under judgment against either succeeds to the interest the debtor had power to encumber. If then the sheriff’s vendee can demand no more from the private vendee than the purchase-money unpaid at the entry of the judgment on which the sale was made, it would seem that the funds of each sale should be appropriated to the judgments in the order they were obtained after the agreement. For, if the purchaser can obtain no greater interest than the unpaid purchase-money, his bidding will be regulated accordingly-</p>

A charge or an encumbrance cannot be payable in part out of the proceeds of a sheriff’s sale, and at the same time remain a lien on the land for the residue, in the hands of the purchaser. Inadequacy of funds to satisfy the judgment does not vary the rule; but the <em>right to apply them to the judgment </em>is, of itself, a total discharge of the lien.</p>

Judgments obtained after such a contract are therefore liens upon a different estate in the land, from those obtained before it; and' a sale on them cannot have the same effect as a sale on the prior judgments, else they would sweep away the title created by the contract. A sale on them affects only the estate left in the debtor after his contract of sale, which may be very small, depending upon the amount of the purchase-money remaining upaid — it conveys a right to receive this so far as the judgment debtor himself could demand it. But he could not demand it, without paying off the liens that were prior to the contract of sale, or suffering the purchaser thus to apply so much of it as might be necessary.
