An appraisement was had under that Act, and found that the land would not divide, &amp;c., and the proceedings returned with the writ. A <em>venditioni exponas </em>was issued, but, before any sale was made, the judgment was transferred by the plaintiff to James Glover, one of the firm of Glover, Kier &amp; Oo., and the execution stayed on the 22d of February, 1854.</p>

When the proceeds were brought into Court for distribution, he claimed to receive $300 by virtue of the proceedings on the former writ. An auditor was appointed to make distribution, who disallowed the claim, and, on exceptions filed to this report in the Court below, the report of the auditor was confirmed, and Dodson removed the proceedings by appeal to this Court, and assigned for error here the' refusal of the auditor and the Court to allow him to take $300 out of the fund in Oom't under the Act of 1849.</p>

In this case the notice was given on the first case, and inquisition and appraisement returned. If the sale had been made on that writ, it is admitted he would have been entitled to the exemption. The sheriff is the officer of the law, and represents all the creditors — certainly all judgment-creditors, and such proceedings upon one notice and claim would bind all the judgment-creditors: Bowyer’s Appeal, 9 <em>Harris </em>210. The reasoning in that case is answered by the facts in this — that the defendant gave notice, &amp;e., without delay.</p>

He gave notice that he claimed the exemption. An appraisement was made and returned. But there never was a sale under that levy. After-wards another execution was issued on another judgment, and another levy was made, not on the same property, but on a part of the same. No notice was given in the latter cáse, and on it the sale was made out of which the fund now in Court arose.</p>
    <p id="b234-8" data-blocks='[["BL_234.8",234,[318,960,1161,645]]]'>It is the settled construction of the Act of 1849 that a debtor, who desires to have the benefit of that statute, must claim it, and that he waives all right under it if he remains silent. The appellant suffered the proceedings, on which his property was finally sold, to go on from beginning to end without making any demand for an appraisement. Can he now be permitted to say that his demand in another case, where no sale took place, is enough without showing that it was repeated in the present case? We think not. Notice to one person who does not sell is not notice to another who does. Even if the same person were plaintiff in both executions, it would not answer; and for this the difference in the two cases would be a decisive reason. It might very well be supposed that the debtor had motives for claiming the exemption, whon the whole of his lot was levied on, which did not exist when only a part of it was seized.</p>
