On the 17th March, 1853, a levy was made by defendant on plaintiff’s boards, and the execution returned <em>“ </em>not time to sell.” An <em>al. ex. </em>issued the same day on which the boards were advertised, and sold the 25th March. When the levy was made and advertised, the plaintiff was absent in the state of New York; but he obtained knowledge of the advertisement before the sale. The sale was advertised to take place at 1 o’clock, on the 25th March, and at 2 o’clock the boards were set up, and after one bid was made, the plaintiff claimed his right of exemption and the appointment of appraisers, to which the defendant replied that he was too' late, and went on with the sale. For not allowing the claim of plaintiff, this suit was brought, and plaintiff recovered a verdict for $189 damages.</p>

It is a fact for the jury to say from the evidence whether the plaintiff manifested his determination to have an appraisement, and did what he reasonably could, to have it done; and whether he was prevented by haste or design of the officer.</p>

The plaintiff did not demand an appraisement until after the property had been set up for sale and the bidding begun. Nevertheless he was permitted to recover.</p>
    <p id="b184-9" data-blocks='[["BL_184.9",184,[286,1133,1162,933]]]'>A party is not entitled to the exemption provided for by the statute unless he demands it. He waives his right by silently suffering property which would otherwise be exempt from levy to be seized and sold. There must be some period fixed at which this demand should be made, and after which it cannot be made. In Hammer <em>v. </em>Freese, 7 <em>Harris </em>255, we said it was clearly too late after the sale had begun. We see nothing in the circumstances of' this case to require a departure from that rule. If a constable should fraudulently take advantage of a debtor’s absence, and sell without giving him a possible chance to get an appraisement, it might, afford a good cause of action. But such fraud should be distinctly proved. There is nothing like it here. The fact that the present plaintiff lived twenty miles away from the place where the property was taken and when it was sold is no excuse. If he could afford to spend time and money in prosecuting this suit to redress the supposed wrong, he might have spent a little to prevent it from being committed. He knew of the intended sale several days before it took place; and he was in the village where the constable was some hours before the sale began. We are quite clear that the written propositions which the defendant’s counsel submitted to the Court ought to have been answered in the affirmative.</p>
