The sheriff’s deed to the plaintiffs was dated February 15, 1851. At the sheriff’s sale, the defendant, Clark, gave public notice that the property belonged to him, having been conveyed to him by Wilson on the 7th August, 1850. This conveyance the plaintiffs alleged to have been made without consideration, and to be fraudulent and void. On the other hand, the defendant alleged that he had bought the property in good faith at a public auction, at which the same had been sold by Wilson, on the 25th June, 1850, and that he had paid in cash for the same, to Wilson, the sum of $10,200, and taken it subject to a mortgage of $3500.

      <em>“ </em>The evidence in this case shows that Wilson was indebted to the plaintiffs, and to other persons, at the time of making the conveyance under which defendant claims; and there are two questions for the jury — the one whether this .conveyance is valid against the plaintiffs, if made without a valuable .consideration; the other whether there was such a consideration. It -is somewhat difficult to give a precise definition of the degree of indebtedness, which will render a valuable consideration necessary to the validity of a deed; but there can be no doubt, that this result will not follow from the existence of small or inconsiderable debts, such as every man may .owe to his butcher or his baker, nor that when a man is largely in debt, he is not entitled to make any gift of his property of á nature to hinder and defeat his creditors and prevent them from obtaining payment. The question depends ;n a great measure on the ratio or proportion of the debts, not so much to .the property he parts with, as t,p that which he retains.</p>

      <em>“ </em>In the present case, Wilson’s debfs amounted to $4000 at the date of the deed. We have no evidence of the exact amount of assets, although it appears that he conveyed other property to Bell. If he received the consideration of this conveyance, it would -of course .be assets in his hands, but if he received it in cash, .it might be less within the reach of his creditors than the estate for which it w-as the .equivalent. It .will he for you to say upon the evidence whether the conveyance to the defendant bore such a ratio to his property and feis debts, as to tend directly to defeat the claims of those to whom he owed them. If ,it did, then it is invalid, unless founded upon a consideration. And this will bring you to the second .question, whether there was such a consideration.</p>

If the deed was a voluntary one, and its effect was to hinder or delay creditors; in other words, if the transfer of' this property would have the effect to prevent the collection of Wilson’s debts, a vendee without consideration, whether there was fraud upon his part or not, would take no title as against creditors. There were circumstances attending the transfer from Wilson to Clark calculated to create suspicions as to its fairness. Wilson’s large indebtedness; the pursuit of his creditors, who were just on the eve' of obtaining liens upon his real estate; his anxiety to dispose of it, evidenced by his peremptory instructions to the auctioneer to sell; together with the proof that neither the scrivener, alderman, nor witness saw any money pass, required, at least, that Clark should place himself in the position of' a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser, by showing that he had actually paid an honest price for the property in dispute; and this, too, by evidence other than the mere written declaration of his grantor. It rarely happens that a sum of money exceeding ten thousand dollars is paid by one man to another, in the purchase of real estate, without some one, other than the immediate parties, knowing the facts. In commercial cities, large sums usually pass through banks, or other places of deposit; and in recent transactions, the evidence,' in nearly all cases, is within the reach of the parties. Wilson himself, if living (and we have no evidence that he is not), might have been called upon to prove that Clark had actually paid him the money stated in the receipt. Although the defendant was expressly' notified that he would be required, upon the trial, to prove payment for his purchase, no evidence upon this subject, however remote, was given or attempted to be given by him. If he could have produced such evidence, and did not, the fault is his own;" if he could not have produced it, may it not fairly be inferred, that no such' payment was ever made ? It was left to the jury, as a matter of fact, and found against him. We have no power to disturb the finding.</p>
