Armstrong and James Potts were partners, and being indebted to Jeremiah Platt, gave him a note for the amount, with Hugh Himblewright, the brother-in-law of Potts, as security. In 1851, about the time the note matured, Armstrong &amp; Potts dissolved partnership, .and Potts agreed to pay this note; Platt consented to the arrangement, and Armstrong’s name was to oe taken off the note. Armstrong being importunate to have an arrangement made by which he would be released from liability, was assured by Himblewright that he need not concern himself about it — that he, Himblewright, would pay it. Platt transfer<a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>red the note to Samnel Crawford, who in 1853 brought suit against Armstrong, Potts, and Himblewright, and recovered a judgment against them. In 1852, Potts confessed a judgment before a justice of the peace to Himblewright for $590, upon which he caused an execution to be issued, and all of Potts’s personal property levied, the most of which Himblewright purchased at the constable’s sale. In 1854, Himblewright paid the judgment of Crawford, and took an assignment of it from him, and had himself subrogated as plaintiff on the record. Armstrong having discovered this state of facts, applied to the Court to open the judgment, and let him into a defence, which was granted by the Court. And this case arises on the trial of that issue between Himblewright and Armstrong.</p>
