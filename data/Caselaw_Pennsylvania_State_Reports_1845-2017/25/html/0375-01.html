Joseph Ball, deceased, in his lifetime was possessed of several tracts of land in the county.of Greene, and in 1835, upon petition of some of his heirs, a writ of partition and valuation was awarded, and upon an appraisement returned one of the tracts was awarded to Mark Custer, who entered into recognisance with Lot Lantz as his surety in the sum of $2000, to secure to the <em>heirs </em>of the said Joseph Ball, deceased, the sum of $932, the price at which the said tract had been valued by the Inquest. On the 4th day of June, 1839, the legislature passed- an Act in reference to the real estate of the said Joseph Ball, authorizing the administrator to receive the proceeds and distribute them according to the interests of the several heirs or claimants. The suit was brought in the name of the Commonwealth for the use of Stephen Caldwell, administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of Joseph Ball, deceased. Mark Custer claimed to <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>be an heir of the decedent, and as such entitled to a portion of the proceeds which it was contended should be deducted from the claim of the plaintiff. The amount of his interest did not appear.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b376-6" data-blocks='[["BL_376.4",376,[298,547,1167,257]]]'>The defendant’s counsel requested the Court to charge the jury “ that the administrator of Joseph Ball, deceased, cannot recover, the terms' of the recognisance being to pay to the heirs;” and “ that the defendants may retain and hold from this recognisance the'amount of the shares they hold either by descent or purchase.” The Court (Gilmore, P. J.) charged the jury as follows :—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b376-7" data-blocks='[["BL_376.5",376,[295,803,1167,374]]]'>“ The Court charge you, the plaintiff is entitled to recover notwithstanding the wording of the recognisance, and that the defendant is' not entitled to deduct from the recognisance what might be his purpart. The Act of Assembly of 4th June, 1839, was passed expressly for the purpose of relieving the Court and jury from the difficult and almost impossible duty of ascertaining the heirs to said estate, and to what each was entitled. This duty has been committed by said Act to the administrator, and we feel disposed to leave, it to him.”</p>

We see no constitutional objection to this Act, and under it the Court' of Common Pleas very properly held that the administrator could, in the name of the Commonwealth, maintain the action, and compel payment of the recognisance.
