    <p class="summary" id="b486-9" data-blocks='[["BL_486.7",486,[282,1340,1167,805]]]'>“ If this be the state of the case, it will be seen that the title of the plaintiff is founded on the title or possession of Hercules Roney, and those claiming under him. This title, or possession, or both, as the case may be, must, therefore, be determined, in order to decide upon the plaintiff’s title. If the will of James Roney gave but a life estate to Ann, Mary, Nancy, and Sarah, the reversion fell, at their respéctive deaths, to the right heirs of James Roney (who, according to the intestate laws in force prior to the Act of 1794, were Hercules and his three sisters, and their issue.) He having conveyed his estate in the three-fourths to them, retaining the part in dispute, the partition and separate possession of Hercules, and those claiming under him, would vest a good title in the plaintiff. But, if the will vested in the devisees a fee simple, Hercules had no title to any part, by reversion or otherwise. If the will gave a fee simple to one, it gave it to all. If Ann, therefore, had a fee simple, nothing was left to be inherited by Hercules, and, at her death, her share escheated to the Commonwealth, and was held by her and the three sisters as tenants in common.</p>

'able against the Commonwealth, as to the other fourth. But, if there was no partition excluding the three sisters from the land <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>in dispute, and no separate possession accordingly, <em>bj </em>those under whom the plaintiff claims, the statute of limitations would not avail. Mary, Nancy, and Sarah being tenants in common with the Commonwealth, and being in possession of the whole tract (as they would be if no partition and separate possession), there was no ouster, apd the plaintiff could not recover. The question recurs, What estate was vested in Ann, as the devisee ? There is evidence showing that, at the death of J ames Roney, this tract called Star Fort was unseated and unimproved. Indeed it is conceded on both sides that the land was wood-land and unimproved. It must have been in the same condition at the time of the making of the will. This being the undenied state of the fact, it is unnecessary to decide what the construction of this will would be, if the land had been improved and yielding profits. I may say, however, I should have doubted, if the fact had been so, whether more than a life estate was carried by the language of this will, notwithstanding the case of Shriver <em>v. </em>Meyer, in 7 <em>Harris. </em>That case was decided on the effect of the language of the introduction,. carried down to the devising clause, and the learned judge delivering the opinion expressly remarks, that the words ‘ as to such worldly estate,’ if they have nothing to which they can attach, must of course be inoperative, and he makes it of importance that the words $1 devise the same,’ or similar expressions, are distinctly attached. In Caldwell <em>v. </em>Ferguson, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Yeates%20883" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Yeates 883">2 <em>Yeates </em>883</a>, relied on in Shriver <em>v. </em>Meyer, Judge Yeates notices the distinction between an introduction declaring an intention <em>to dispose of all </em>the testator’s estate, and one that <em>with respect to it, </em>he devises so and so. In the present case, the language is merely that the testator ‘ wills and bequeaths in the following manner and form <em>touching </em>such worldly estate which it had pleased God to bless him with,’ meaning, perhaps, no more than <em>with respect to it, </em>he wills and bequeaths, &amp;c.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b487-6" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[177,1828,1170,646]],["BL_488.1",488,[289,431,1174,476]]]'>“ But as this land was wood-land and unimproved, as it could be of no benefit to the devisees, without a large expenditure of money or labour to improve it, a heavy charge on the devisee's which the uncertainty of life would leave no certainty of being repaid to them; and as the land is subjected to a reservation of one-third of the profits, to be given to the mother of the testator, during life, the testator must have meant to vest a fee simple in the devisees, and it brings the case within the chief ground on which Caldwell and Ferguson was decided. The present is even stronger than that case. Here, the estate devised could not otherwise be beneficial to the mother, as well -as the devisees, and here the reservation is for the life of the mother, implying that the testator had supposed he had given the others something more enduring than an estate for their own lives which might not have endured as long as that of the mother. Without profits, it was <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>worthless to her, and without a greater estate it was worthless to them; for he could not suppose they would improve it upon the uncertainty of life, and pay a rent to her besides. He gives his mother the reservation for her <em>‘ sustenance,’ </em>as he expressly says; and it would be unreasonable to suppose he meant to subject the devisees to a heavy burden for this end, and yet limit their estate so that it might expire before the land had yielded profits to any one; and then, who should take up the forgotten reversion ? His will gives no response. We conceive that the subject of the devise, and the whole scope of the language of this will, enable the conclusion to be legally drawn, that a devise in fee was intended.</p>

That this undivided one-fourth by the Act of 4th June, 1839, became vested in- the persons therein named, whose title afterwards vested in James Holmes,, the defendant, and consequently, as the statute of limitations doea not run against the Commonwealth, the plaintiff cannot recover as-to the undivided one-fourth of the land in controversy.</p>

Act of 1839 transferring expressly an undivided interest, the defendant’s title was not of the whole land in dispute, but of an undivided one-fourth only. If, therefore, the jury believe that, the tract was divided at an early day, and that, since Hercules Roney, and those claiming under him, held the part in dispute in possession in severalty, claiming in their own right for twenty-one years or upwards- before they were ousted from the possession, and so held it peaceably and uninterruptedly, and not as tenants in common with Mary, Nancy, and Sarah, and those claiming under them, the plaintiff is entitled to recover the undivided three-fourths of the part in dispute. Mary, Nancy, and Sarah being entitled to three-fourths of the tract, if they made partition with Hercules, a mere intruder without right, and suffered him -and those claiming under him to remain in peaceable possession against them for twenty-one years or upwards, they lost their title to' that part of the land possessed by him by the statute of limitations; and it became a positive title thereafter in him and his assigns, on which a recovery can be had as to the three-fourths they had owned, leaving the remaining fourth unaffected in the Common,<a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>wealth only because the statute does not run against her.

Long before this period, the title of the plaintiff, if perfected at all by the statute of limitations, according to the evidence, had been consummated, and no act therefore by the grantees of the Commonwealth, either by adopting a former partition with. Mary, Nancy, and Sarah, or making a new one by the same lines, could affect the plaintiff’s title.</p>

The death of Ann in 1791; the state of the land; the deed of Hercules to his sisters; the time he took possession; his conduct in always treating the land as his own; the assessments; the age of the marks on the ground, all tend to show that the partition was not made till several years after Ann’s death, perhaps not earlier than 1795, and not later than 1796.</p>

In the proceedings thereupon she treated the land as undivided, and by a solemn act or law transferred her title in 1839, as still an undivided interest. • There is not a shadow of pretence she ratified or adopted the partition. The defendant admits the partition, made at the age of the marks, which is fifty-nine years ago; the undisputed evidence shows the possession of Hercules commencing in him before the year 1800, and continuing in his daughter Elizabeth down to the time of her death in 1829, a period of more than twenty-one years, to say nothing of its continuation down to 1838, when Holmes leased to Enlerick.
