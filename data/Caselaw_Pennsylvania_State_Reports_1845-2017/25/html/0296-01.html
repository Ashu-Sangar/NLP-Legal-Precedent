Chambers kept the account of both parties, and his account, which was given in evidence, showed that there were debits and credits in each year from 1828 to 1850, both inclusive. It was proved on the trial, that some of the credits in 1847, 1848, and 1849, for bark, &amp;c., had been directed by defendant to be credited on his account. This suit was brought in 1852, to recover the balance due plaintiff.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b296-12" data-blocks='[["BL_296.11",296,[290,1397,1161,686]]]'>“ The plaintiff has given in evidence a book account, the first item of which is dated 25th February, 1828, and the last the 22d day of April, 1850. His book shows the entry of various credits, the earliest of the 2d August, 1828, and the last of the 20th February, 1850. This suit was brought 26th June, 1852. The defendant pleads, in addition to the ordinary pleas, the statute of limitations. The defendant had no book of accounts, but gave evidence of sundry articles sold and delivered to plaintiff in 1847, 1848, and 1849. Plaintiff contends that the statute does not bar that portion of his accounts older than six years at the institution of this suit, on the ground that it was an open and running account. We are of a different opinion. It is evidently not a mutual account, it is kept on one side only. We think all the plaintiff’s items older than six years are barred by the statute, and the jury will, therefore, take into consideration only that portion of the acbount since 26th June, 1846.”</p>
