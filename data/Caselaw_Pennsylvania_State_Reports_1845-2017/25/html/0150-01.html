In May, 1852, he made an alleged sale to his brother of his Avhole stock in trade, including notes and accounts due to him, Avithout making any provision for plaintiffs’ debt, Avho, on the 25th June, deeming the sale fraudulent, issued a foreign attachment, and attached the goods sold to the brother of defendant. The plaintiffs declared upon a note for $400, given to him by defendant 24th March, 1852, and for $2000 worth of goods sold and delivered. Defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit </em>and payment with leave, and a former recovery. On the trial, plaintiffs gave in evidence to the jury the note for $400, and two bills for merchandise amounting to $1820, and rested. The defendant gave in evidence the record of a suit commenced in July, 1852, in the Supreme Court of New York, in which the plaintiffs and defendant in this suit were the parties, and in which a judgment Avas recovered, 18th August, 1852, against the defendant, for $1468.38 and costs. Plaintiffs excepted to the evidence. The plaintiffs then proved by the attorney Avho brought the suit, that he had had the note of $400 in his possession since the 25th June, 1852, to the time of trial.</p>
