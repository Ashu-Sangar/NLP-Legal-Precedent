In May, 1831, Thomas Ford conveyed to his son Charles 121 acres, subject to a reservation of 21 acres during the lives of <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>his parents, and which they occupied until they both died — the last four years ago, when this suit was brought. Against Charles Ford, the common source of title, a judgment was obtained in 1834, on which a <em>ft. fa. </em>was issued to Eebruary Term, 1835. The sheriff returned that he had levied on 100 acres of land, more or less, bounded on the north by Humes, west by James Ford, south by Swift &amp; Moodie, and east by J. Greenlee, with a frame dwelling and barn thereon. To April Term following, a <em>vend. ex. </em>was issued, and the sheriff returned, sold on the 10th August to John Sargeant, to whom a deed was acknowledged 15th August. Sargeant conveyed to Humes, the plaintiff below. Evidence was given to show that the boundaries given in the levy would include the whole 121 acres, and that there was a frame dwelling and barn on the 100 acres, and a house and barn on the 21 acres.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b86-6" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[324,1020,1167,599]]]'>The defendant gave in evidence another judgment against Charles Ford, in favour of R. T. Trask, in 1835, on which a <em>ft. fa. </em>was issued, the land in controversy levied upon in 1839, and sold in 1841 to Trask, whose title became vested in McClenahan, the defendant. He then offered to prove that when the levy was made on the writ in Flough <em>v. </em>Ford (under which Humes claimed), the land in dispute was excluded, and that, at the time of the sale, it was publicly declared that it was not selling — to be followed by other proof that the plaintiff said that he had not bought it of Sargeant; to this plaintiff objected, and the Court rejected the offer. The defendant also submitted the point that the sale on the <em>vend, ex., </em>in Flough <em>v. </em>Ford, having been made after the return day of the writ, passed no title; which the Court answered in the negative.</p>

Was it not competent to the defendant to controvert and rebut this by the same kind of proof? The exclusion or inclusion of the land could not be determined by the levy only. The western boundary of each being land of a contiguous owner, even if the 100 acres were bounded by that owner, it would not necessarily follow that the other piece was also included. The offer did not specify the <em>hind </em>of proof to show the exclusion, but merely to establish the fact, and to rebut the parol proof of inclusion given by the plaintiff below.</p>

Sergeant <em>v. </em>Ford, 2 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>125. The levy was by metes and bounds, plain and explicit, and its construction and extent was matter of law. It is only in eases of patent ambiguity that parol evidence is admissible to affect the, extent and meaning of a levy; and then not by evidence of the character here offered. The offer was an entirety, and if any part was incompetent, a general objection to it is good: Sennett <em>v. </em>Johnson, 9 <em>Barr </em>337. The offer proposed to exclude the 21 acres by something <em>dehors </em>the record — -this was clearly, incompetent: Sergeant <em>v. </em>Ford, <em>ante; </em>Beeson <em>v. </em>Hutchinson, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20443" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Watts 443">4 <em>Watts </em>443</a>.

It was a description by the adjoining owners, which was said by Judge Huston in this very case, 2 <em>W. $ Ser. </em>126, to be equivalent to a description by courses and distances all round. This levy, thus free from all ambiguity, and exempt also from any alleged fraud or misrepresentation, the defendant below attempted to impeach by offering to prove that when it was made, the land in dispute was excluded; and, at the sale, it was publicly declared it was not selling; to be followed by other proof that the plaintiff said he had not bought it of Sergeant.</p>

The offer, therefore, must have been to show the exclusion by something <em>dehors </em>the record; and, as that something was not specified, the Court did well to presume that it was irrelevant and incompetent. It was an attempt to contradict and impeach a record by evidence, for which the party offering it must have had but little respect, or he would have exposed its character.</p>

      <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>And then, as to the declaration at the time of the sale, if it was not made by a bystander — if it was the declaration of the sheriff; ■or the creditor, or the defendant, why was the offer silent on the point ? Did counsel expect the Court would admit <em>any </em>declaration of that sort by whomsoever made ? It may be well doubted whether such a declaration, even when made by a party in interest, would be evidence against a clearly expressed levy; but, with the questionable shape in which this offer came, it was properly rejected.</p>

    <p id="b88-7" data-blocks='[["BL_88.5",88,[300,932,1160,172]]]'>The defendant’s counsel justified this offer, on the ground that the plaintiff had given parol evidence of the boundaries of the land; but that was evidence of location, which was consistent with the levy and not contradictory of it.</p>

The <em>venditioni exponas </em>was returnable to April Term, 1835, but the sale, continued by adjournments, did not take place till the 10th of August — the first day of the next succeeding term. Under the Acts of Assembly, in force before the Act of 1836, this practice obtained very generally throughout the state, and received the sanction of this Court in numerous eases, which will be found cited in Blythe <em>v. </em>Richards, 10 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>161. It is too late now to raise a question upon it.</p>
