March, 1853, signed by Jesse Lazear, cashier. The bank defended the action on the ground that no such deposit had been made by the plaintiff on the 19th March, 1853, but that such-a .deposit had-been made by him on the 19th March, 1852, which, ha’d' been, subsequently paid by the bank upon the plaintiff’s checks. To sustain this defence, Jesse Lazear, the cashier, was offered as a witness. He had been a large stockholder in the bank, but had assigned his stock on the day before the trial to his son, and was released by the board of directors from liability to the bank, for any matter, growing out of this transaction. He was objected to by the plaintiff on the ground of interest, hut admitted by the Court. The. witness stated under objection what was the custom of the bank-in making up the accounts, and endorsing drafts and papprs. before they leave the bank — which is sufficiently set . forth, in the opinion of this Court. The deposition of Henry L. Pennock, in connexion with the books of the bank, was offered and received under objection.</p>

The only possible way the bank could avoid payment was by calling their own officer to negative his own act at a time when he was a party in interest. Was he competent to do this ? Did the assignment to his son remove the difficulty ? A stockholder on the very eve of the trial assigns to his son $45,000 worth of stock, knowing it would be reassigned the next hour if he desired it, and then appears upon the stand as a witness. <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>This is a mockery of the rule which excludes persons interested from testifying.

It was insisted that the deposit could not have been made on the 19th March, 1858, because there would have been a discrepancy in the accounts for that day in making up and balancing the accounts in the evening. The jury were left to infer that the accounts of that day were so balanced in the evening, and no discrepancy appearing, therefore no deposit was made. It was the parties’ own acts, and should have been excluded on that ground. Facts cannot be proved by general usage: 2 <em>Harris </em>376.</p>

In Metz <em>v. </em>Detwiler it was allowed to ask, “ as to the practice at medical consultations.” The answer must necessarily be as to the acts of parties. The usage must be proved from facts: 2 <em>Greenleaf’s Ev. </em>§§ 5, 252.

The contingent liability of one who has been a stockholder to the noteholders of a bank, in case of its insolvency, is too remote an. interest to disqualify him from testifying in favour of the bank, unless there is some evidence of the inability of the institution to meet its engagements : Willing <em>v. </em>Consequa, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Pet.%20301" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Pet. 301">1 <em>Peters </em>301</a>.

There was no transaction of the kind in March, 1853. If he (Meighen) had made a deposit on that day, I would have entered the deposit in the daily receipts; and this is one reason for my belief that he made no such deposit. If he had made such a deposit, it would have’been such a coincidence as would not have escaped my mind; besides, he owed no note of this kind- at the time, and that, if there had been any discrepancy in the books, I would' have heard of it. It is our custom to endorse- such drafts before sending them away.” Upon the reception of his evidence, the 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th errors are assigned. It is unnecessary to notice the assignments separately and in detail, as they are all involved in the question whether the above stated evidence was properly received or not. The allegation of the plaintiff in error is, that the witness was illegally permitted to prove the custom of the bank in settling its books, and endorsing drafts, and to speak of the contents of the book, and to express his belief with his reasons for it, that no deposit had been made on the 19th March, 1853. It is important to remember that the witness had already stated, without objection, that no deposit was made by Meighen on the 19th of March, 1853, and that the evidence which is alleged to have been improperly received, was given merely as corroborative, or, rather, as explanatory of his previous assertion. Where a witness has stated a fact, or given an opinion, he may be asked, either in chief' or on cross-examination, how he knows the fact, or upon, what grounds his opinion is founded; and there is no error in permitting him- to answer as to-his knowledge-of fact's, or to give his reasons for opinions expressed-; If it should appear that either the one or the other were based upon grounds which were legally inadmissible, it would clearly be the duty of the Court to instruct the jury to disregard the testimony.

In Schoneman <em>v. </em>Fegley, 2 <em>Harris </em>376, the witness said, “he did not know whether he gave a-receipt for a note or not;” and it was held that the question, whether he usually gave receipts for notes, was properly ruled out. This is by no means an authority against the decision of the Court in the case now in hand. If the witness in Schoneman <em>v. </em>Fegley had stated that he did give a receipt for the note in question, and had been refused permission to give, as one of the reasons for believing that he had given a receipt, his invariable practice to give such receipts, the case would have been in point here ; but it is not now.</p>
