The case was withdrawn after hearing a witness, and this the Court below held a judgment on the merits or a technical <em>retraxit. </em>A like proceeding held substantially to be a <em>non-pros, </em>or discontinuance: Gibson <em>v. </em>Gibson, 8 <em>Harris </em>9.

When the plaintiff fails to appear, judgment of non-suit may be given, but the moment he appears no such authority exists. <em>Before </em>hearing he may withdraw or discontinue, but <em>after </em>he can do neither; and the justice’s record in aid of either cannot help him.</p>

If he attempts to do so, and enters his judgment in that form upon the record, it will be consi<a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>dered equivalent to a judgment in proper form for the defendant. No other suit can afterwards he brought for the same cause of action. It does not matter whether the magistrate’s decision against the plaintiff be founded on want of evidence to support the claim, or on a successful answer to it by the defendant. This was ruled in Gould <em>v. </em>Crawford, 2 <em>Barr </em>89, and in Lawver <em>v. </em>Walls, 5 <em>Harris </em>75.</p>
    <p id="b78-6" data-blocks='[["BL_78.4",78,[313,674,1164,248]]]'>But there is no case which decides that the plaintiff may not become nonsuited on his own motion, or that he may not, if he pleases, discontinue or withdraw his action. We held, in Gibson <em>v. </em>Gibson, 8 Harris 9, that a record' which showed that the plaintiff withdrew his suit, and- confessed judgment for costs, was no bar to another suit for the same cause.</p>
    <p id="b78-7" data-blocks='[["BL_78.5",78,[314,928,1166,645]]]'>In the case before us, the suit was brought to recover a small balance due on a note. The only defence in the Court below was, that the plaintiff had previously brought suit before another justice for the same money, and that proceeding was set up as a bar. It seems that in the first suit the parties appeared, and after some progress was made in the hearing, the plaintiff being surprised by some evidence which the defendant produced, asked for a continuance, and failing in that, withdrew the suit, and confessed judgment. This 'is exactly like the- case of Gibson <em>v. </em>Gibson, except that there the withdrawal was before the day of trial, and here it was after the trial had began. This makes no material difference. The plaintiff has a right to withdraw or discontinue his suit at any time before the justice pronounces upon it. The cases which decide that the justice cannot give judgment -of nonsuit against him after he appears, have no application.</p>

Amount to be liquidated by prothonotary of Common Pleas.</p>
