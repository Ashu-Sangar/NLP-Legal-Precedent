The declarations of Exline and Ann Lehman, testified to by their witnesses, was long prior to the judgment in the action of covenant. Will these declarations be allowed to contradict the agreement and the fact established by the judgment? The knowledge of the witnesses was confined to themselves — the record was notice to all the world —so the agreement treats both tracts as one, and provides for the payment of a stipulated sum for both, and with this the judgment <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>corresponds — and it was also in proof that the value of the other tract was totally inadequate to satisfy the balance due on the agreement in 1842.

Barclay was the executor of Ann Lehman, at the time he purchased the land in controversy on the judgment against Exline, surviving covenantor in the purchase with Moser, for $100. He subsequently sold the land for $808.80 to Arnold, the defendant below, under covenants of general warranty, which sum he was charged with in the settlement of his administration amount, and paid with interest to the estate of Ann Lehman, of which the plaintiff below was then the administrator <em>de bonis non. </em>In the mean time, and pending the controversy, the plaintiff below bought out the title of Moser’s heirs to the land, and brought this ejectment afoot, having obtained the judgment against Barclay’s estate for Lehman’s estate.

Moser died in 1835. The judgment was taken in 1842; not against Moser, his administrators, or his heirs. The case Torr <em>v. </em>Jones, <a href="/watts/4/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Watts 465" data-case-ids="1842704" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0465-01">4 <em>Watts </em>465</a>, is not disputed; but there the judgment was recovered by the vendor against the vendee. There was a union of the legal and equitable interests, and by this arrangement the parties to the <em>record </em>did definitively settle their relations. In this case there was no such proceeding; there is no disclosure of the relation between the vendors, nor of that of the vendees. The relation between the vendors and vendees only is declared. The true relation between Moser and Exline is disclosed by the evidence. Moser owning the equitable title, there was no union of the legal and equitable estates by the sale of Exline’s interest in the land; no definitive settlement of the rights of the parties, as in the case cited, which is not, therefore, in point. The ease is, as stated in the Court below, “a controversy between Moser and Exline.” Plaintiff in error is entitled to Exline’s interest; defendant in error to that of Moser. The jury have determined their relative value. By the decision of the Court, in May last, Barclay, in the purchase, took the risk upon himself. Arnold is in no better position; and, aside from this, it is plain that Arnold had notice. The only title Barclay could show in Exline was the agreement of April, 1818. Did that show to Arnold what share was Moser’s ? what Exline’s ? On the contrary, the record on which the land was sold showed that Moser paid all the money that ever was paid, and there was enough upon the record to put any man upon inquiry.</p>
    <p id="b40-8" data-blocks='[["BL_40.6",40,[300,2032,1155,344]]]'>3. The third error assumes that the title of defendant in error was equitable, and requires that a tender should be made to entitle him to recover. The loss of time, thirty-seven years, and continued possession for twenty-seven years, and the evidence'of payment, as proved, by witnesses, raise the presumption of payment so as to dispense with a tender. And this is not rebutted by the judgment, for the reasons that the articles of agreement embraced two tracts, and Moser was no party to the judgment.</p>

In increasing the delay of Moser’s heirs in the prosecution of their claim. 2. In the prosecution of an unjust judgment. Was this an unjust judgment ? Who says so ? The representatives of J. Barclay. Who obtained it ? Who was attorney in 1832 ? Who executor of one plaintiff in 1833 ? Who the assignee of the other plaintiff in 1811 ? Who issued execution, controlled the levy and sale, and became the purchaser ? Surely Mr. Barclay should not complain that we have been collecting the judgment he took so much pains to obtain. If the purchase-money of this land was all paid, no one ever told this to the defendant in error. He knew nothing of this till the day Miller’s deposition was taken.</p>

Barclay was executor from 1833 to 1853; and the prosecution of Moser’s claim five years ago would have had no effect upon his liability in the former action. Between him and Lehman’s heirs it could make no difference. If he bought and sold the land, and received the money, he was liable. If he did not, then the debt was lost through his gross negligence as executor. So far as can be now seen, there was a valid claim against Moser and Exline, to the amount of the judgment for the balance due on another tract. Why was this claim permitted to slumber for twenty years ? Barclay was bound to collect- it from Moser or pay it himself. The whole case was on record and freely discussed on a former trial in the Court below, before auditors, and in this Court; in all of which defendant in error took the ground that Abraham Lehman was only bail for Ann, and that Exline was only bail for Moser, and so proved it to the satisfaction of Court and auditors, and before a jury in a feigned issue; and all this before defendant in error bought a single share of Moser’s heirs.</p>

Previous to April, 1818, the title to the land in dispute was in Ann Lehman. On the 7th of April, A. D. 1818, Ann Lehman and her son, Abraham Lehman, sold by articles of agreement to Philip Moser and John Exline two tracts of land — the one for which this action was brought, and a mountain tract — for the consideration of one thousand dollars.</p>
    <p id="b42-9" data-blocks='[["BL_42.9",42,[328,1007,1156,561]]]'>In 1823, an action of covenant was brought by Ann and Abraham Lehman against Philip Moser and John Exline, to recover the unpaid purchase-money. Moser died in 1835, and in November, A. D. 1842, a judgment was obtained against Exline, in the action of covenant, for the sum of $854.23. Upon this judgment the tract in dispute was sold in January, 1843, to Samuel M. Barclay, the executor of Ann Lehman, who conveyed it to the defendant Arnold in May, 1843. Philip Moser went into possession in 1818, and remained until his death in 1835, leaving a widow and children, who continued the possession until 1844; since which time the tract has been occupied by the defendant, under his purchase from Barclay. The plaintiff has the title of the heirs of Philip Moser.</p>
    <p id="b42-10" data-blocks='[["BL_42.10",42,[328,1565,1160,810]]]'>The important point in the case is the effect of the sheriff’s sale upon the judgment obtained in the action of covenant. The plaintiff denies that this judgment was a lien upon the land, averring that the purchase was really for the benefit of Moser, and that Exline was a party' to the articles of agreement, not as purchaser, but merely as security for the payment of the purchase-money. He further alleges that the purchase-money for the tract in dispute had been paid by Moser to Ann Lehman in her lifetime. The defendant’s position is, that the judgment, although against Exline alone, having been recovered in a suit brought on the articles of agreement for the sale of the land, was a lien upon the whole equity outstanding, and that the sale extinguished all the interest which Moser and Exline, or either of them, had in the land. The Court of Common Pleas permitted the plaintiff to prove by parol testimony that the purchase was made for the benefit of Moser, that Exline signed the agreement as surety, and that Ann Lehman had said in her lifetime that the tract in dispute had been fully paid for by Moser; and instructed the jury that if they found these facts their verdict should be for the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b42-11" data-blocks='[["BL_42.11",42,[374,2374,1112,47]],["BL_43.1",43,[158,417,1169,1660]]]'>By the articles of agreement an equitable title passed to Philip <a id="p43" href="#p43" data-label="43" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*43</a>Moser and John Exline, as tenants in common, with the right to demand a conveyance of the legal title upon the payment of the purchase-money. The equitable title of Exline could not be destroyed by parol evidence that he was a surety instead of a purchaser, first, because this evidence could not gainsay the written instrument under seal, and, second, because it would be a violation of the statute of frauds and perjuries to permit one who has purchased by writing jointly with another to prove by parol that his co-purchaser has no interest in the purchase. The rule is well settled in Pennsylvania that an equitable title to land is within the statute of frauds: Murphy <em>v. </em>Hubert, 7 <em>Barr </em>423. And it is equally well settled that a transfer from one tenant in common to another can only be by writing, and that the possession of the one is the possession of both: Galbreath <em>v. </em>Galbreath, <a href="/watts/5/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="5 Watts 146" data-case-ids="1843993" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0146-01">5 <em>Watts </em>146</a>. At the time when the action of covenant was commenced, as well as when the judgment was entered against Exline as between the parties to the agreement, Exline was a tenant in common as to one-half of the equitable interest in the land in dispute, and the judgment against him was unquestionably a lien upon this interest; but no case goes so far as to hold that a judgment obtained against one tenant in common, in an action of covenant brought on articles of agreement for the sale of land against two, is a lien upon the interest of the deceased obligor or covenantor. The rule would doubtless be otherwise as to joint tenants, as the entire interest or estate would pass to the survivor, and be bound by the lien of a judgment obtained against him alone; but the real estate of a deceased tenant in common, whether held by articles of agreement or by deed of conveyance, passes upon his death directly to his heirs or devisees, and cannot be encumbered by a judgment against another where neither the heir, devisee, or personal representative is made a party. The cases cited by the plaintiff in error do not sustain his position, that the judgment bound the interest of Moser as well as that of Exline. Love <em>v. </em>Jones, Day <em>v. </em>Lowrie, and Harbach <em>v. </em>Riley were all cases where the action was brought and the judgment had against the vendee; and they simply decide that a sale upon such a judgment passes to the purchaser the entire estate, legal and equitable; but in nothing that is said in either case is there warrant for the position here assumed.</p>

    <p id="b44-6" data-blocks='[["BL_44.4",44,[339,542,1164,1368]]]'>As the sale upon the judgment against Exline united the equitable interest in an undivided moiety of the estate with the legal title, it left the other moiety free from the one-half of the purchase-money, so that if Moser in his lifetime, or his heirs since his death, has paid upon this purchase five hundred dollars and its interest, the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action the one undivided half of the land in dispute. Taking the amount recovered in the judgment against Exline as the true amount then due, it would seem that more than one-half had been paid, for the judgment is for a sum considerably less than the one-half of the purchase-money, and its interest from the date of'the contract, in 1818, to the rendition of the judgment in 1842; but, as this judgment is not conclusive between the parties to the present suit, as to the amount then due, the question is <em>still </em>open for inquiry; and, if it should be found upon another trial that Moser, or those claiming under him, had not paid the one-half of the purchase-money, a conditional verdict should be given in favour of the plaintiff for the one undivided moiety of the land, upon his paying to the defendant within such time as the jury should fix any residue of the one-half of the purchase-money, and interest, after deducting what has already been paid by Moser, the defendant, to be entitled to the money so' paid only upon conveying to the plaintiff the legal title to the one-half of the land. The conveyance should be made by the defendant, because the legal title passed to, the whole estate from Ann Lehman to Samuel M. Barclay, by virtue of the sheriff’s sale and the subsequent proceedings against the estate of Mr. Barclay by the estate of Mrs. Lehman; and being so in Mr. Barclay, it would enure to the benefit of his vendee, the defendant in this suit. If, however, the jury should find, as they probably will, upon a second trial, that Moser had paid his part of the purchase-money, a verdict in favour of the plaintiff for the undivided half of the tract is all that the case requires.</p>
