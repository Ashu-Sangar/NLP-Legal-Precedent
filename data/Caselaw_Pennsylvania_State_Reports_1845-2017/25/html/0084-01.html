    <p class="summary" id="b84-9" data-blocks='[["BL_84.8",84,[324,1021,1167,559]]]'>“The 36th section of the Act of 16th June, entitled ‘An Act relating to Reference and Arbitration,’ enacts that ‘If the party by whom a rule of reference shall be entered, his agent or attorney, shall fail to cause a copy of the certified, rule, or of the record containing the names of the arbitrators, and of the time and place of meeting, to be served as hereinbefore required, he shall, for every such default, forfeit and pay the sum of twenty-five dollars, one-half to the use of the county, and the' other half to the use of the person who will sue for the same; Provided, That nothing herein contained^ shall be deemed to deprive the Court of the right of setting aside any award obtained without due notice as aforesaid, or shall interfere with the right of the party to recover such damages as he may have sustained.’</p>

We do not so regard the terms of the Act. The penalty was evidently intended as a punishment on the party wdiose default should prevent the meeting of the arbitrators chosen in the impartial manner prescribed by the Act. If the arbitrators meet, the party has an interest in having the same arbitrators sit who have been fairly chosen. Should there be no meeting of the arbitrators, in consequence of the want of <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>service* of the notice, the party against whom the rule has been entered, has been injured by the loss of his time, and the trouble of preparing for a trial; which time and trouble might frequently be more than the penalty.</p>

      <em>“ </em>The Act, however, fixes a certain penalty, not to the extent of the actual grievance, but as a punishment for the neglect; and be the damages greater or smaller than the penalty, the Act in no wise interferes with the right to recover them; and therefore evidence of them in the penal action would be out of place. The only inquiry is whether the default has been made without sufficient excuse. The jury having passed upon this, was warranted by the evidence in so finding, none having been offered by the defendant.</p>
