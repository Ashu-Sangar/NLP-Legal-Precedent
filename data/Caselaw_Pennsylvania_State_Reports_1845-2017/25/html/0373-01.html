Wright, the appellant, became the purchaser at the sum of $25,700. Upon this purchase he paid, at the sale to the sheriff, $400, but failed to pay the residue. The sheriff returned <a id="p374" href="#p374" data-label="374" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*374</a>that, he having failed to comply with the terms of sale, the property remained unsold for want of buyers. At the resale, it was sold to J. K. Moorhead for the sum of $19,-800. On application to the Court, an auditor was appointed to distribute the $400 paid' by Wright, and the auditor applied it to the judgments against Everhart, which report the Court confirmed. After the deed was acknowledged to the second purchaser, the Court permitted the sheriff to amend his return, by stating the amount which Wright, had paid on the first sale, to the allowance of which the counsel for Wright objected.</p>
