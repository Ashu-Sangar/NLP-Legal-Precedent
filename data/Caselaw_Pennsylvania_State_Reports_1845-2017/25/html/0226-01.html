H. McClelland, in the 8th Ward, in the city of Pittsburgh. The title was in S. &amp; J. Hamilton, against whom a judgment was recovered, and <em>fi. fa. </em>No. 308, of April Term, 1852,-was issued, and a levy made on lots Nos. 2 and 3; and, on the 22d April, 1852, extended at the yearly rental of $140. Notices served on defendant, and they not retaining it at the yearly rental, a <em>venditioni exponas </em>was issued to No. 312, of July Term, 1852. On the 31st July, 1852, the sheriff sold lot No. 2 to John <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>Barton for $110, and lot No. 3 to Samuel Morrow for $200. On the 4th of September, 1852, on motion, the Court granted leave to the sheriff to amend his levy, by striking out Nos. 2 and 3, and inserting Nos. 3 and 4. The sheriff’s deed to Samuel Morrow, for lot No. 4, sold on <em>venditioni exponas, </em>No. 312, July Term, 1852, offered, for acknowledgment, 11th September, 1852. The acknowledgment was objected to by J. S. Hamilton, Esq., but for whom the objection was made does not appear in the case. On the 25th, the deed was duly acknowledged. The plaintiff claimed the premises, under a subsequent sheriff’s sale, as the property of S. &amp; J. Hamilton, and alleged that the levy and sale, under which the defendant claimed, conferred no title to lot No. 4.</p>

The judgment-creditors under whose judgment the plaintiff here claims, might have objected to the amendment at the time, but did not do so; the defendants in the execution under which defendant claims, are not here objecting to the regularity of the proceeding: the amendment in the levy, <em>venditioni exponas </em>and sheriff’s deed were all allowed by a Court of competent jurisdiction, before the deed was acknowledged, and before the levy and sale under which the plaintiff claims. The record of this amendment gave full notice to the plaintiff and all others of its contents, so that no want of notice can be alleged under all the circumstances of this cáse, and the decisions of the Supreme Court. I feel fully constrained to say that the regularity of this amendment cannot be inquired into in this collateral proceeding, but that the same can only be successfully assailed, if at all, on a writ of error sued out in the case'* where it was allowed. <em>I shall be very glad indeed, if the Supreme Court can find sufficient reasons for re' versing me, </em>as I consider the amendment if allowed to stand, forms a dangerous precedent.</p>
