Paul were partners engaged in the iron business in Westmoreland county. On the 1st day of September, 1852, three judgments, in favour of Ramsey, Graham, and Robb, respectively, were entered in the Common Pleas of Fayette county against the firm. On the 6th day of March, 1854, Samuel C. Cummings, the appellant, obtained a judgment against Jacob D. Mathiot. An execution was issued on the judgment in favour of Ramsey, and a tract of land, the <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>individual property of Jacob D. Mathiot, was levied and sold. The distribution of the proceeds of the sale was referred to an auditor, before whom Mr. Cummings claimed that his judgment should be first paid, being the individual debt *of Mathiot, and the property sold his individual property.</p>

To substantiate his claim the appellant invokes the aid of the principle, that joint creditors have a right to priority of payment out of the joint estate of several partners, and the separate creditors a like right to priority of payment out of the separate estate of the partners. It is unnecessary to point out how and when the principle stated applies, for it is clear that it has no application to the case in hand. A lien attached by law is never interfered with by introducing an equitable rule for marshalling assets. The reason why joint creditors are preferred in distributing the proceeds of partnership real estate is, that the estate is not subject to the liens of judgments for separate debts, ■ as the individual members of the firm have nothing but a resulting interest in the proceeds after payment of the partnership debts: Kramer <em>v. </em>Arthur, 7 <em>Barr </em>165. And this is so only as regards real estate held as partnership property, for if it is held by the partners simply as tenants in common, the estate of one of the <a id="p270" href="#p270" data-label="270" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*270</a>partners may be encumbered by a mortgage given by him for his separate debt: McDermot <em>v. </em>Lawrence, 7 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>438. And it may be sold on an individual judgment, and the purchaser takes the title discharged from the partnership debts: Hale <em>v. </em>Henrie, <a href="/watts/2/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 Watts 143" data-case-ids="1840152" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0143-01">2 <em>Watts </em>143</a>.</p>
