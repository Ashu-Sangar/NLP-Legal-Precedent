    <p class="summary" id="b100-13" data-blocks='[["BL_100.11",100,[321,1346,1164,473]]]'>In March, 1847, Butler Myers contracted with William P. Gregg for the purchase of the lot in question for the consideration of $100, for which he paid in two notes, on Thompson McCrea, to that amount. Gregg gave a receipt in full for the consideration, stipulating to make to said Butler Myers a warranty deed for the same. After making the contract, Butler Myers agreed by parol with the defendant, his son, that Gregg should make the deed to him, provided defendant would pay certain debts of the said Butler. The deed was made accordingly, and, at the request of the plaintiff, made to the defendant; and defendant retained the possession of the lot which he then held.</p>

The plaintiff has the legal title. The object of the statute was to prevent the transfer of real estate without some written evidence of such transfer. When this is done the statute is satisfied, and this has been done in this instance. That the defendant procured the equitable estate in the first place by a parol contract, can make no difference, having subsequently procured the legal estate by deed: Jackson ex dem.

The father, by permitting the conveyance to be made in the name of the son, did not divest himself of the title. It was no abandonment, but merely created a resulting trust in favour of the father. The amount or character of the debts he was to pay, or that he paid anything whatever, was not shown. Whatever interest the defendant had was under this indefinite agreement, and was in substance nothing more than a parol sale or gift, and could confer no title. The case <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Johnson%20197" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="16 Johnson 197">16 <em>Johnson </em>197</a> does not sustain the plaintiff’s doctrine — there the party, to whom the purchaser directed the deed to be made, was the creditor of the latter; and the deed was directed to be made to him in satisfaction of the debt. The debt was' the consideration, and the original purchaser ceased to have any interest in the premises. In this case there was no such agreement or interest in defendant; and plaintiff, at the time the conveyance was made, still retained his interest. No money was paid by defendant for plaintiff, nor was the deed made in consideration of any debt due from the plaintiff to defendant. A trust, therefore, resulted to the father, the plaintiff: Jackman <em>v. </em>Ringland, 4 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>149.</p>
