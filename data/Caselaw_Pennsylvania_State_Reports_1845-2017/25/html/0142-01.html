This will contained the following clauses: “ And as to such worldly property Grod has seen meet to bless me with in this life, I give and dispose of in the following manner, viz., first of all it is my will, and I order that all my just debts and funeral expenses be duly paid and settled as soon as convenient after my decease, and as touching all the rest of my estate, real or personal, I do give and dispose in the following manner, viz.,” then, after making bequests to his daughters Jane and Eliza, the will proceeds: “ I allow to my son John the farm with its appurtenances, also my bed, with the dining-table, and my family Bible, and my gun: also one year’s schooling, to be paid out of the movables of the place. I allow, if my children choose to live together on the place, that the log building now raised, near the other house, shall be repaired for them to live in.”</p>

In ejectment, the probate cannot be invalidated <em>by </em>looking into the evidence on which the decree was founded. This can only be done by the introduction of testimony tending to show that the will was not executed at all, or that it was signed under circumstances which render the instrument invalid. These principles were affirmed in Holliday <em>v. </em>Ward, 7 <em>Harris </em>485. The will in this case was therefore sufficiently established by the decree admitting it to probate, notwithstanding that it- was founded on the testimony of the executors.</p>

This principle is settled by the cases of Schriver <em>v. </em>Myer, 7 <em>Harris </em>87, and Wood <em>v. </em>Hill, 7 <em>Harris </em>513. John M’Vicker, therefore, took a fee simple under the will of his father.</p>

The 6th section of that Act, requiring her <em>previous </em>consent, acknowledged before a judge of the Common Pleas, applies only to cases where her husband, by her authority, undertakes to transfer or encumber her estate. It has no application to conveyances made by herself.
