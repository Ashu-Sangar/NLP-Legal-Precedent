Burry agreed with Nesbit to purchase the oxen in dispute at 3 cents per pound, live weight, and that the weight should be ascertained by the scales at “ Mt.

The weighing being necessary to a perfect sale where there is no delivery, is not dispensed with by an unsuccessful attempt to weigh, or by a refusal to try a better mode of doing it. These matters left the parties as they stood before, and the title remained in the vendor. Nor does earnest or part payment aid in vesting' the title where the quantity is yet to be ascertained, and there is no delivery. Under such circumstances the contract is essentially executory, and the part payment only shows a concluded and binding agreement. Taking the facts as above stated, the sale remained imperfect and executory, and the vendor might refuse performance subject to the vendee’s right to damages for the breach. The other instructions are correct.</p>
