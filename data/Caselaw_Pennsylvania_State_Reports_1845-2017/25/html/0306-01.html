But the construction of .the contract is, that it is an agreement to convey by devise at the death of the devisor, on condition of the payment of the annual ¡sum of $12.50 during his and his wife’s lifetime. Now the nature of the instrument, by which the estate is to be conveyed (to wit a will), necessarily imports an agreement ,to vest the title at the death of the testator, and not before; .and consequently specific execution cannot be decreed until that time.</p>

The scrivener was not examined for this purpose, though present at the bar. The evidence, as to even the existence of any such agreement, is anything but clear and satisfactory; a matter necessary in proving fraud or mistake to reform a writing. Jeremiah Maloney, the only witness present at the consummation of the contract between old Mr. Maloney and Michael C. Maloney, says not a word about such an agreement on part of the old man; and James Forquer, who gives the most clear and direct evidence of a rehearsal of the bargain by the old man, says expressly, ‘ he said he had given each 60 acres; each to pay $ 12.50 a year during his and his wife’s lifetime, and <em>at their death </em>the land was to be theirs.’</p>

So far from the testimony of Jeremiah Maloney, corroborated and supported as it may be by that of James Forquer and others, being positive, clear, and satisfactory evidence of an independent and separate parol sale or gift of an estate to Michael C.

The annual payment of the $12.50 was indubitably the consideration of the written contract evidenced by the will and accompanying agreement. The inducement to the written contract was also the past labour and services of the grandson, his relationship, and the benefits of their arrangement, which secured to the testator himself a living, as testified by James Forquer.</p>

      <em>“ </em>Was there a contract for present possession in consideration of prospective services, or of partly these and partly past services ? Surely there is nothing like a clear and distinct statement of such an agreement by the old man to be found in Jeremiah Maloney’s testimony. If it be not there, it is in vain to look for it elsewhere, and find it at the same time directly and positively proved. Perhaps we might conjecture, from the loose general expressions- of old Michael Maloney to others, that something of this kind may have taken- place outside of the written contract. But this would be to reverse the rule of evidence, and give to these <em>ex parte </em>declarations a higher place than to the direct evidence.</p>
