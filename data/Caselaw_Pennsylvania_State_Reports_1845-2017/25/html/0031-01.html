By the Acts of 1850 and 1851, this duty is imposed upon the executor or administrator, and to <em>set apart </em>the property. In. all the acts the object is declared, to <em>exempt </em>property, and not to give money. And in Hammer <em>v. </em>Freese, 7 <em>Harris </em>255, it was decided that the only remedy against the <em>officer, </em>if he fails to comply with his duty, is by action. The party cannot come upon the fund. Under the Act of 1851, the executor is the officer. We do not seek this property from him or them as assets of the .decedent; we seek ,to make them pay because they have disregarded a plain duty. ' They were bound to <em>set apart </em>the property for the widow. If they took it they were trespassers, and are liable in this action.</p>
