Leimer (the witness) called upon defendant, and requested payment of the demand of plaintiff — that defendant said he could not raise the cash then, and asked for time, and said he would pay with 5 per cent, interest. Andrew, son of defendant, testified that, in 1847, he requested the plaintiff (by letter) to pay a debt which he owed to him, and that plaintiff answered him in 1847, by a request, that he would call on his father, the defendant, and ask him to pay the money which he (the defendant) owed the plaintiff, or make a turn-over with Andrew of the debt, which he owed his father, for purchase-money of land bought of him. His father, the defendant, refused to pay or make the turn-over, and alleged that what money he had received of the plaintiff was a present made to him — that he would pay David himself what he owed to him, if his necessities required it.</p>

The Court instructed the jury that “ the promise of 1848, as testified to by Andrew Beck, if the jury believe the testimony, is sufficient to take the case out of the bar of the statute.” Andrew Beck had purchased a place from the defendant, and was indebted for the purchase-money. By directions from the plaintiff, Andrew applied to the defendant to allow the plaintiff’s claim to be deducted out of the purchase-money.- This the defendant positively refused, saying that the money received from the plaintiff was a present — that what he owed to the plaintiff he would pay to the plaintiff himself when he needed it, or when his necessities required. This was not an admission that he owed the plaintiff anything, nor a promise which assumed the form or the substance of a legal contract to pay him anything. It was a mere indication of intention to repay one kindness by another, when the occasion seemed to require it. This disposes of the first assignment of error. The second is not presented in such a way as to be considered here.</p>
