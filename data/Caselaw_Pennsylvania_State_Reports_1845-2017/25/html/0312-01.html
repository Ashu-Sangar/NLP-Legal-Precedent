It cannot be expected that this can be reproduced from the testimony of witnesses who have seen it months or years before. It seems to us exceedingly probable that the commissioner’s report, in this case, is nothing like the original paper. The counsel would hardly call such a thing a case stated. It sets forth merely an abstract question of law. There is not a fact mentioned on which we could tell whether the plaintiff has a claim or not.</p>
