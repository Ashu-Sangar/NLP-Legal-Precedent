The defendant Marshall, being the first endorser on two notes, became a party to two of those judgments, one for $4200, and the other for $5000. At the same time Creacraft &amp; Carson assigned over various consignments of property, for the benefit of the endorsers, and the amount of which was applied to all the judgments.</p>

The Court thereupon made an order, staying execution on the said judgment until the bank should issue <em>scire facias </em>upon the same, to give Marshall an opportunity of interposing said defence. This <em>scire facias </em>was accordingly sued out, and was returned served on all the defendants, except Creacraft, and <em>“nihil” </em>as to him. The appearance and plea were by Marshall alone, and the jury were sworn as to him alone. On the trial of the cause, the defendant offered the deposition of George A. Creacraft. It was objected to by plaintiff, on the ground that the witness was a party to the judgment, and liable over to Marshall, for the debt and costs recovered against him.

The circumstance that the bank was the creditor'of all, and-that the judgments were taken at the same time, and that there were securities in all, would not be sufficient in equity to require an equal application of the money made to the several judgments. A debtor has a fight tb appropriate money as he may think proper; this is the general principle in respect to voluntary payments; but, where money Is raised by process of law, or <em>in </em>invitum, the right of application does- not belong to the debtor — the law then makes the application.

The defence was, substantially, that the judgment had been paid, and it was to prove payment that the principal debtor was offered as a witness. Upon the failure of this defence, the principal was, doubtless, liable to the surety, not only for the principal debt recovered, but also for the costs, and this according to the cases of the Bank of Montgomery <em>v. </em>Walker, 9 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>229, Smith <em>v. </em>Thorne, <a href="/watts/9/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 Watts 144" data-case-ids="1850016" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0144-01">9 <em>Watts </em>144</a>, Davenport <em>v. </em>Freeman, 3 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>557, disqualifies him from testifying, upon the ground of interest.

True he was not served, and was not a party to the issue ; but Parke <em>v. </em>Bird <em>et al., </em>3 <em>Barr </em>360, rules that this makes no difference, as he was a party to the suit at the impetration of the writ, which is also the doctrine of Wolf <em>v. </em>Fink, 1 <em>Barr </em>439.</p>
