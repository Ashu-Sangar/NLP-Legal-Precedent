On the 14th day of February, 1852, Mrs. Kiester leased the premises to the defendants, by a lease under seal, for the term of three years, at the annual rent of $75, payable on the 1st of October of each year.

The .'removal by the tenants from the premises, with the unaccepted offer to-deliver the key, was no evidence that'the lease had been rescinded.
