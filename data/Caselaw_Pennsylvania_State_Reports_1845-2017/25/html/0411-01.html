Evidence has been given of payments by the delivery of timber, lumber, &amp;c., of which the jury must judge, and determine to what extent.- The plaintiffs have shown bills of goods furnished in the ■ progress of the dealings between the parties, the amount of which the jury must determine from the evidence. As a general rule, no interest is chargeable on a running account of a merchant who . sells goods in the ordinary way, unless settled from time to time, notes taken, or something to indicate a different understanding. It is a general rule, that payments made, without any agreement or understanding as to what debt it is to be applied to, will be appropriated by law'to the oldest debt. If there has been no other agreement shown here, the jury will determine by the evidence what payments made by the defendants in this case shall be applied to the judgment, and find their verdict accordingly.”</p>

There is no reason why the same rule should not be applied to sales of goods made by the merchants of Pittsburgh, as the custom is the same there as in Philadelphia, and equally notorious. The first assignment of error is therefore sustained.</p>

Where a debtor indebted on several accounts makes a payment, he may direct how it shall be applied, but if he makes no appropriation of it to any specific debt, the creditor then has the right of application, and if he credits it generally on an open account, the law will not afterwards apply it to the payment of a judgment, even although older than the account, and more particularly is this so where the creditor has security for the payment of the judgment, and none for that of the open account. In the absence of any agreement, understanding or direction to the contrary, the payment made in this case should have been applied first to extinguish the book account and the residue only to the judgment.</p>
