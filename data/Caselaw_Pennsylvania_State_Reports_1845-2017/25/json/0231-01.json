After that the costs were taxed, and now we have a writ of error to,the taxation. This is claiming a right to two writs of error to the same judgment, or two suits for the same cause of action; and, if this can be, why may we not have another ? A case cannot be thus split up. A party must not sue even in error prematurely, if he, wants his whole case reviewed. He ought to see that the costs are taxed before error brought, if he fears that the taxation may need correction here.\nJudgment affirmed with costs.",

The defendant denied the contract, and also set up the statute of frauds and perjuries. Upon the first trial of the cause, the plaintiff, by leave of the Court, filed an additional count,\nPwing, for plaintiff in error.\nKaine, for defendant in error."
