The cause being submitted to the Court below upon a case stated, judgment was entered for the plaintiff below; to reverse which the defendant sued out this writ.\nMellon and Stanton, for plaintiff in error. \u2014\nThe presumption of law and of fact is, that the annual salary compensated no more than the regular and defined duty; and it being shown that this duty was not within the enumeration, and it being admitted to have been worth the full amount of $200, the law implies an undertaking to pay for it. The work being shown to be extra, is therefore entitled to extra compensation; for it is a well established principle of law \u201c that, if work additional to that contemplated in the original contract be done at the request of the party benefited by it, he will be liable therefor, upon an implied promise to pay for it: Story on Contracts, \u00a7 15, citing Lovelock v.
