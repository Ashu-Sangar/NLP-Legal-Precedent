Patton had been the administrator of Joseph Minesinger, a son of plaintiff; and settled his account, in which a balance of $1612.16 was ascertained to be in his hands. This suit was brought to recover a balance due, part of the above-stated sum. On the trial the defendants produced several receipts, the last of which was dated on the 11th September, 1847, and was for the sum of $100. They alleged that the entire balance had been paid by Samuel Patton in his lifetime, for which no receipts were taken; or, if taken at the time, that they were lost.\nIn support of this allegation, the defendants proved that the plaintiff, who was old and infirm, had appointed her son, John Minesinger, her agent, to collect this money and attend to the settlement with Samuel Patton; and then offered to prove that the agent, in conversations with witnesses, prior to the date of the receipt for $100, had said that Samuel Patton had paid the whole amount due except $100. This was objected to by plaintiff\u2019s counsel, and rejected by the Court; to which defendant excepted.\nThe jury found for the plaintiff $175.96.\nThe rejection of the testimony offered by the defendants was the error assigned.\nBetter man, for plaintiffs in error. \u2014\nThese declarations were made during the continuance of the agency. His receipt would have been evidence, and that was no more than a written declaration : 3 Barr 473; 8 Watts 393; 9 Barr 28; 7 Watts 39.\nCunningham, for defendant in error. \u2014\nThe declarations were not made while he was doing any act in relation to the agency. Declarations of an agent are only admissible as part of the res gesta: Story on Agency, \u00a7\u00a7 134, 135, 137; 2 Stark. Ev. 24 ; 10 Ves. 123; 8 Bing. R. 451; 3 Wash. C. C.

His subsequent declarations are not received against the principal: 7 Greenl. 421; 4 Cush. 93; 11 Humph. 67; 11 Ill. 648; 6 Cush. 93."
