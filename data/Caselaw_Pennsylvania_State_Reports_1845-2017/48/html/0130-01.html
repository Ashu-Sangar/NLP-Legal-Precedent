The principle has been asserted in several cases that a change of securities does not necessarily work an extinguishment of the debt, and that extinguishment or satisfaction depends upon the agreement or intention of the parties, which must be referred to the jury as a question of fact. And in Richabaugh <em>v. </em>Dugan, 7 Barr 394, Mr. Justice Coulter says, ‘ It is the distinct agreement of the creditor to accept the thing in satisfaction and payment of the debt, which makes it good evidence under the plea of payment.’ This rule is now the settled law of the land, notwithstanding the construction given to the case of Musgrove <em>v. </em>Gibbs, <a href="/dall/1/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Dall. 216" data-case-ids="12141530,1408555" data-case-paths="/dall/1/0216-01,/us/1/0228-01">1 Dall. 216</a>, by the defendant’s counsel.

The original contract being usurious, by the provisions of the Act of Assembly, Page might have claimed a deduction from the amount of the mortgage, to the extent of the excess of interest claimed, yet he did not choose to do so. The debt was fixed and certain, and had become due by the failure to pay up the interest, and there was therefore no controversy about the amount to be paid, nor the time of payment, and no propositions were made by either party on that subject. On the contrary, both parties treated it as a sum fixed and certain, to be paid to the last farthing. The only matter to be settled was the mode of payment, whether it should be in money or land at its cash value. The present defendant had the power to enforce <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>the payment in money, hut he made the proposition to take land in payment at its cash value, and the only difficulty was to fix the valuation. After proposals on both sides to have the value fixed by third persons, the parties themselves agreed upon certain lots, that were to be conveyed and received in full payment and satisfaction of the claim within a certain time. And there was no attempt to prove, on the trial, that this land was not worth the amount due. If the defendant could have shown that it was not worth the amount of his claim, it might have been a very important fact in his defence. We are bound, therefore, to conclude that he did not abate one jot or tittle of his claim in taking land instead of money. The agreement of the 28th of August 1861 shows conclusively that the payment of the bond and mortgage was the only subject of treaty between the parties at that time : and that agreement was carried out to the letter.

On the same day Heath replied to this proposition by letter, declining their offer to have the valuation fixed by referees, but renewing his former offer to take thirty-two lots in a certain block, and one hundred and twenty feet off another lot.

The formal overruling of defendant’s points. 2. The refusal of the court to instruct the jury that if they were satisfied, from the written propositions of settlement, the written contract of 28th of August 1861, the deed in pursuance of it, the satisfaction of the mortgage of the 19th of January 1858, and the parol evidence in relation to the admissions of Page that the parties consummated said contract as a settlement and compromise of all claims upon either side arising out of the transaction of loan between them, their verdict should be for defendant; and that if the jury believe the bond and mortgage of 20th February 1856, were at the instance of the plaintiff surrendered and satisfied, and a new bond and mortgage, dated the 19th January 1858, given, covering other property, and with different terms of payment, such surrender and satisfaction of said bond and mortgage would amount to a discharge and payment of the original indebtedness, the usury, if any, would be then complete, and the plaintiff, having failed to bring suit within six months thereafter, would be barred by the Statute of Limitations from a recovery. 3. In instructing them “ that the satisfaction of this mortgage (of 20th February 1856) was not understood or intended by either of the parties as a payment of the debt secured by it, is abundantly manifested by the uncontradicted evidence in the cause. More especially is the defendant precluded from making such an allegation by his written agreement under seal, dated 24th November 1857, which expressly declares the object to be to release the lien on the mortgaged premises, to enable Page to sell and convey the same. The whole transaction can be regarded in no other light than as a change of securities, without the slightest intention that it should work an extinguishment and satisfaction of the debt. For these reasons I am clearly of opinion that the Statute of Limitations did not begin to run when the first mortgage was satisfied.” 4. In refusing to charge that the true construction of the contract of 28th of August 1861, and the deed of Page and wife of the 13th December 1861, which must be taken together, is, that as Heath discharged Page from all debts, claims, demands, and suits, arising out of said bond and mortgage of the 19th January 1858, upon condition that Page would give him a conveyance for the land agreed upon, the making of said deed, and the satisfaction of the mortgage, operated as mutual discharges from all further liabilities arising out of or connected <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>•with the before-mentioned obligations. 5. In refusing to charge that the deed of Page and wife to Heath, being the voluntary act of the parties, in which they acknowledge the receipt of $12,500 as the consideration, which sum includes the value of the stock of the road aforesaid, must be taken as an acknowledgment, at that time, of the validity of the stock purchase. After such solemn recognition by Page and wife of the validity of said purchase of stock, and receipting for it in their deed to Heath as lawful money of the United States, it would be against equity and good conscience to allow Page to recover in this case, as it would be substantially allowing him to recover a portion of the very purchase-money which he acknowledges he received from defendant. 6. In refusing to charge the jury that Page having adopted the stock in question as a part consideration for the sale of land, cannot recover in this action without proof of tender to defendant of said stock before suit brought, and having, as appears by the stock-book and the evidence of Mr. Fetterman, assigned, in March 1862, three thousand dollars of said stock to third persons, and thereby put it out of his power to return it, it would be unconscionable to allow him to recover the amount he gave for it, and at the same time sell and pocket the proceeds or keep the same. 7. In refusing to charge the jury that plaintiff having failed to bring his action within six months from the 28th August 1861, the time when the contract for the purchase of the land was complete, he is not entitled to recover. 8. In refusing to instruct the jury that plaintiff has misconceived his action, debt being the only remedy to enforce a statutory obligation; and this action, being in case, cannot be sustained without showing a tender of the stock to defendant before suit brought. 9. In refusing to answer, in any way, defendant’s 11th point, viz., that Page having held the stock from 1856 until 1861, with full knowledge or opportunities of knowledge of its value, and having then appropriated it as part payment of the consideration of the land sold defendant, in the absence of evidence of fraud, or imposition in the contracts of 21st August 1861, he is not entitled to recover. 10. In refusing to charge that the contract of the 28th of August 1861, was a merger of all the others which preceded it; and as by this contract the defendant was to take land for the money and stock he had previously given the plaintiff, and was to stand the risk and hazard of the land depreciating below the value of said stock and money, he was equally entitled to any sum to which it might appreciate beyond the amount of the indebtedness of plaintiff, without being subject to the penalties or the liabilities of the usury law. 11. In rejecting the following offer: Defendant offers to prove by John Heath that Page, the plaintiff, repeatedly called and requested Judge Heath, the defendant, to take land <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>in full satisfaction and settlement of the controversies and claims between them, and the final acceptance by Judge Pleath before the written propositions were made on either side, for the purpose of showing that the contract of 28th August 1861 was a contract of settlement of all controversies, and also for the purpose of showing that Page was the party who first proposed the giving of land in settlement of all claims.</p>

The 2d section of the Act of 28th May 1858, Purd. 561, contains such a limitation of the right of action, but a defendant who means to avail himself of it should plead it. I suppose it to be a general principle, that all Statutes of Limitations, to be available, should be pleaded. They may be waived by the persons for whose benefit they were made, and unless pleaded upon record, plaintiffs have a right to presume a waiver, and to come to trial unprepared with evidence to meet such -a defence. The action of ejectment is the exceptional case in which the Statute of Limitations may be set up under a plea of the general issue, but it required an Act of Assembly to establish this exception.

He held that the satisfaction of the first" mortgage was not payment and receipt of usury, from which the six months would begin to run, but that it was a mere release of lien and substitution of one security for another, and this he inferred from the tenor of the paper signed by Heath, and dated the 24th of November 1857. It is hard to see how this conclusion can be doubted, for what said Heath in that paper ? After reciting the mortgage he held against Page, he declares his motive — “ That Page may, if possible, make a sale of his interest on the most advantageous terms, and then agrees, on such sale being made, he will release and satisfy the mortgage, provided that the said Page shall procure me other <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>good and abundantly safe real security for the whole amount now due on said mortgage, payable at the end of ten years from this date, with interest payable semi-annually.”</p>

On the contrary, was not the debt, the “whole amount” of it, to survive for ten years on the pledge of other “abundantly safe real security?” There does not seem to be room for two opinions upon this point. If Heath’s carefully-considered written words mean anything, a change of securities, and not an extinguishment of the debt, was the thing intended.</p>
    <p id="b143-7" data-blocks='[["BL_143.5",143,[116,840,1165,376]]]'>But counsel would have had the question submitted to the jury.

The defendant maintained that these transactions amounted to a compromise and release of the plaintiff’s cause of action, and if they did not, that they were not a “payment” of <em>“usury” </em>within the meaning of the statute.

    <p id="b143-9" data-blocks='[["BL_143.7",143,[114,1829,1163,341]]]'>To keep a clear view of it before our minds, it is necessary to remember that the first mortgage of 1856 was given upon the usurious consideration, that that mortgage was substituted by the mortgage of 19th January 1858, which was for the “ whole debt,” and of course upon the same usurious foundation as the first mortgage, and that the town-lots in Birmingham were conveyed by the deed of 13th December 1861, in satisfaction of this last mortgage.</p>

The agreement of 28th August 1861 imports that the conveyance of the lots was to be a “ full satisfaction and payment of all claims and demands against said Page and wife,” under the existing bond and mortgage and the suit thereon, but there is not a syllable about Page giving up any cause of action <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>he had or might' have against Heath. Indeed, as to Heath, it was only a release of such actions as arose out of the mortgage, hut, as to Page, it was a release of no cause of action whatever. Nor did the testimony of Mr. Keenan prove anything to restrain Page’s suit. There had been considerable negotiation about the mortgage — suit had been commenced, and judgment thereon taken for $12,567.90, and, says Mr. Keenan, as the result of all his interviews with Page, “ a desire to close amicably the controversy I was managing, was the idea impressed on my mind from his manner and conversation.” And again, “the substance of what he said was the expression of a desire to close up all controversy.” “ The carrying out of the written agreement was the subject-matter of these conversations.” The controversy Mr. Keenan was managing, and the written agreement alluded to, related to the mortgage, and these were the subjects to which Page’s expressions were applicable. They had no reference, and ought to have no application to his cause of action not existing then, but which arose subsequently when he had paid the usury. Doubtless he might release it upon a sufficient consideration, but we see not a spark of evidence that he said anything about releasing it.</p>

Heath agreed in the paper of 28th August 1861, that “ they should be full satisfaction and payment” of that contract; and said McKean, C. J., in Musgrove <em>v. </em>Gibbs, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Dall.%20237" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Dall. 237">1 Dall. 237</a>, “ it is well established that the receipt of one thing in satisfaction of another is a good payment.” This was said of the payment of notes of hand by other notes, and in a <em>qui tam </em>action, under the penal provisions of our old Act of Assembly against usury. It was attempted in the argument to apply the doctrine of Musgrove <em>v. </em>Gibbs to the satisfaction of the first mortgage, but the evidence of substitution instead of payment was irresistible, and hence this principle could not be applied there. But here it is applicable, for, if a debt may be paid in something else than the legal currency of the country, it may be paid in land, and if a debt may be paid in land, then Heath was so paid. Under the plea of payment, evidence of payment in specific articles, not money, is constantly received in our practice : Hamilton <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0570-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 570" data-case-ids="1856252" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0570-01">4 W. &amp; S. 570</a>; Richabaugh <em>v. </em>Dugan, 7 Barr 394.

Set-off rests on mutual dealings, regardless of the intentions of parties, but when a debt shall be considered as extinguished, and what equivalent shall be received in lieu of it, whether money, cattle, or land, are questions of intention, and the law esteems that a payment which the parties have treated as payment. And what would be payment <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>in pleading and evidence generally, is payment under the statute of 1858.</p>
    <p id="b145-6" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[135,479,1162,1077]]]'>But if the Birmingham lots were payment of the mortgage, when did they become payment ? at the date of the agreement to convey them, or at the delivery of the conveyance ? This is a very material question to the plaintiff’s right of action, for more than seven months elapsed between the agreement of August 1861 and the delivery of the deed. The lots belonged to Mrs. Page, and though she signed the agreement, with her husband, she acknowledged no instrument in the forms of law until the deed was made. The deed took effect only from the time of delivery, which was in April 1862. Then it was that Mrs. Page’s title vested in Heath, and then it was that he satisfied the mortgage of record. Prior to that time the parties rested on the agreement to convey; on the 14th April 1862 they consummated the conveyance, and extinguished the mortgage. Had Page called on Heath to satisfy the mortgage before that date, the latter might well have replied that he was not yet paid his debt, for that nothing less than the deed of Page and his wife, duly acknowledged and delivered, could be payment in pursuance of the agreement. We think, therefore, that the court was altogether right in holding the mortgage paid by the conveyance of the lots, and that the date of the payment was the delivery of the deed, which was within six months before the institution of this suit. Nor is there any ground for the complaint that the court construed those papers and declared their legal effect, instead of submitting them to the crude speculations of the jury.</p>
    <p id="b145-7" data-blocks='[["BL_145.5",145,[134,1556,1162,859]],["BL_146.1",146,[300,397,1170,987]]]'>But it is claimed that the railroad stock which entered into the original loan should have been returned before suit brought, or at the least that it should have been credited to Heath at its present value. It is impossible for us to say what value the jury attached to the stock. The money loaned by Heath to Page in 1856 was $5000, the sum at which he took the lots in 1862 was $12,000, and the jury found a verdict for Page of $7400. The stock was the cloak of the usury. It was put into the original bargain at $5000, but was worthless at the time, or nearly so. There was evidence that it had improved <em>some </em>since. Was it necessary for Page to return the stock as a precedent condition to his right of action ? We think not. He had bargained for and bought it at an exorbitant rate, to be sure, but his title was none the less complete for this reason. Though the taint of the contract, it was an essential ingredient of the contract ; without it Heath would not have made the loan. Page never disaffirmed the contract, but performed it to the satisfaction of Heath by the conveyance of the Birmingham lots. It was thenceforth a fully-executed contract, and the purchased stock became absolutely Page’s property. He might have retained <a id="p146" href="#p146" data-label="146" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*146</a>and deducted whatever sum would have expressed the excess over legal interest, and paid only the balance, but hé “ voluntarily paid the whole debt,” and thereby entitled himself to an action under the Act of Assembly. It is not an action in disaffirmance of the contract, nor upon an inchoate title, but it is dn pursuance of the contract, and upon a title to the excessive interest which is complete. When such contracts are made they are made under and subject to the law of 1858. Its provisions interpenetrate all usurious contracts. The lender as well as the borrower is bound to know what the law of his contract is, and after he has accepted full performance of it at the hands of the borrower, it ill becomes him to insist that the borrower should reinstate him in the condition he was before the contract was made, instead of visiting him with the consequences which he knew the'Statute had annexed to all such bargains. The action has no other effect than to reduce the contract to the legal standard of interest. It does not disaffirm, avoid, or contradict the contract, but only razees it down to lawful proportions. No return of the stock, therefore, or offer to return it, was necessary as a condition precedent to the action. The plaintiff'qualified himself to bring such an action, when he voluntarily made full performance of the contract, and that was full performance which the defendant accepted as such.</p>
    <p id="b146-6" data-blocks='[["BL_146.4",146,[304,1385,1158,382]]]'>Whether the stock was counted at anything in making the verdict, we have no means of knowing. If it had any value this ought to have been ascertained, and allowed in adjusting the amount of the verdict. Judging from the amount of the verdict, we would think the stock was thrown out as worthless, and if it was, we will not say, for it is not proper to decide the point now, whether Heath can still recover it back. If included at any price, it would seem to us that the verdict was too large, but the remedy for this was a new trial, and not a writ of error.</p>
    <p id="b146-7" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[304,1769,1157,376]]]'>It is said the action was misconceived, that it should have been debt and not case. The Act of 1858 does not prescribe the form of action; indeed, it does -not expressly give the right of action, but only impliedly, from the limitation imposed. The action is not for a statutory penalty, but it is to recover back an excess of interest voluntarily paid upon a usurious contract. It is necessarily founded upon the special circumstances of the case, and therefore there is no misconception in bringing an action on'the case.</p>
    <p id="b146-8" data-blocks='[["BL_146.6",146,[308,2145,1153,140]]]'>When it is added that John Heath’s testimony was properly rejected as irrelevant, we have sufficiently noticed all the legal propositions contained in the assignments of error.</p>
