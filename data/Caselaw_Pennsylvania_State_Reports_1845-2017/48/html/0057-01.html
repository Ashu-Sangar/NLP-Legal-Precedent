    <p class="summary" id="b57-11" data-blocks='[["BL_57.10",57,[165,1184,1167,764]]]'>The material facts of the case were these: — On the 29th of March 1861 t'he bank - discounted two notes, one drawn by Christian Smith in his favour, and endorsed by him, dated March 23d 1861, at three months, for $1600, the. other drawn by William Meiley, in his favour, endorsed by him, dated March 30th 1861, at three months, for $1260. Before the maturity of these notes Mr. Konigmacher died. At the time of his death there were on deposit in the bank to his credit the sum of $700.66. When the notes fell due they were protested for nonpayment. On settlement of the account of the executors of the will of Mr. Konigmacher, his estate was found to be insolvent, or nearly so. The bank then claimed to retain the money deposited on account of these notes, and asked a dividend out of the estate of deceased upon the balance. This was objected to by other creditors, who insisted that the bank was bound to account for these deposits to the estate of deceased, and receive a dividend only on the amount of Konigmacher’s indebtedness to it thereon.</p>

The Exchange Bank, 4 Barr 32, rules the case in hand against the appellants. It is a mistake to suppose that Beaver <em>v. </em>Beaver, 11 Harris 167, did, or was intended to overrule Bosler <em>v. </em>The Exchange Bank, although the reporter says so in his syllabus. Lewis, J., in delivering the opinion of the court in Beaver <em>v. </em>Beaver, after citing it and Light <em>v. </em>Leininger, 8 Barr 403. in which it is fully recognised, said, “ but these cases do not touch the question presented on this record.” Nor did they. They were cases of debtor and creditor, and Beaver <em>v. </em>Beaver was the case of a surety called on to pay a demand to the estate of his principal, and the court, on equitable grounds, allowed the defendant to retain, by means of a conditional verdict, funds in his hands as indemnity against part of the claim sued for, and gave liim a set-off for a portion paid as surety. The cases are very dissimilar.</p>

But I see not how the hank becomes clothed with their equities, or bound to assert them,- so as to-bring the case within the principle of Beaver <em>v. </em>Beaver. The contest is exclusively between the bank and the estate of Konigmacher, and as his estate is insolvent, and his debt to the hank did not fall due till long after the hank was his debtor, the appellants, on the authority of the cases cited, were not entitled to retain the money in hand to the extent claimed: 2 Smith’s Leading Cases 329.</p>
