He started from Herd’s tavern on horseback, in the direction of his home, four or five miles south of the town, had passed to the upper end of town and turned into a cross street on his way home, when he was <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>followed by a crowd, wbo signalled to Richard W. Oswald, one of the defendants, to stop him, after he had passed into the cross street near Oswald’s dwelling on his way home. Oswald did stop him, and a crowd of men and boys came up and collected round Kennedy. After some little delay, in which Millisen said he should not be harmed, Oswald and Andrew J. Kauffman led Kennedy’s horse, one at each side of the bridle, with Kennedy on the horse, down the Main street of the town, the crowd of men and boys following, and took him to the town hall. Joseph Lease, Esq., was sent for, who said he had no jurisdiction of the case, and afterwards, by a vote of those present, Kennedy was permitted to leave. Afterwards a crowd collected round Kennedy at the tavern, and he was again taken to the town hall and again released.</p>

That afterwards at Herd’s tavern, where the arrest of Alvey and its legality was again discussed, he used similar expressions in reference to the arrest of Alvey; said that he would talk as he pleased, and defied any one to arrest him; that he spoke in derogatory terms of the government, saying “Damn such a government; we have no government.” There being no evidence against Levi Kauffman, a <em>nolle prosequi </em>was entered as to him.</p>
