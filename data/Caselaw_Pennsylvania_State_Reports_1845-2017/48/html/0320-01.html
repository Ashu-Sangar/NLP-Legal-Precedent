Whatever may have been the cause of the hole, if the defendants had notice of its existence, and knew that it rendered the street dangerous, it was their duty to repair it or have it repaired, and if they failed in the performance of their duty in. this respect, they are liable for the consequences of their negligence. They would not be responsible for an injury occasioned by an opening in the street for the purpose of putting in or repairing water-pipes, or by the negligent and improper manner in which the opening was filled by those having charge of the work, if such injury should occur during the progress of the work, or before they had notice of the defective manner in which it was done. Eor in such case they would not be guilty of negligence. But if they had notice of the condition of the street, and that it had become dangerous, in consequence of the negligent and improper manner in which the opening was filled and paved, it would be their duty to repair the street, or cause it to be repaired; and if they should knowingly suffer it to remain out of repair, and in a condition unfit and dangerous for travel, they would be responsible for the consequences of their negligence in this respect. If, then, the defendants had notice of the hole, if they knew that it rendered the street unfit and dangerous for public travel, and if they knowingly suffered it to remain in that condition without an effort to repair it, from the time they purchased and took possession of the road until the happening of the injury, they were guilty of negligence, and are responsible for its consequences, although the defect in the street may have-been occasioned by the sinking of the earth, which was filled into the opening made for the purpose of putting in or repairing the water-pipes supplying the bath-rooms of the St. Charles Hotel with water. If this was the cause of the defect, and if, as between the defendants and the party whose negligence caused it, it was the duty of the latter to repair the street, as between Ule defendants and the public it was the duty of the former to see that it was done. The question is not whether the city or the owner of the hotel is responsible to the defendants, but whether the defendants were guilty of such negligence in suffering the street to remain out of repair as renders them responsible for an injury occasioned thereby. And the court instruct the jury that if they knowingly suffered it to remain out of repair, <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>they are responsible for the damages sustained by plaintiff, in consequence of the injury to his son, if occasioned thereby.”</p>

And this principle is equally applicable to the case of a father who sues for damages arising from an injury to his son. But in judging of the negligence or misconduct of the son the jury will consider his age and capacities, and apply to his conduct the same standard that they would apply in judging the conduct of boys of like age and capacity. Ordinarily boys have not the same judgment, experience, and discretion as men. But this boy was between sixteen and seventeen years of age at the time of the accident, and must be considered as capable of exercising the same degree of care and discretion that boys of his ag.e ordinarily exercise. If judged by his standard he was guilty of negligence or misconduct, which contributed to the injury he received, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover.
