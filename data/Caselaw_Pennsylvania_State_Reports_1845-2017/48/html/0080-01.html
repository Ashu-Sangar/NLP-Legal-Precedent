Where a legatee is a child of the testator, and a minor, incapable of supporting himself, or one to whom the testator has placed himself <em>in loco parentis, </em>and no special provision is made for the maintenance of the legatee, interest will be allowed on the legacy, although not payable until a future time, as upon the legatee’s attaining full age. For the purpose of maintaining the legatee, interest must be paid on the legacy, whether it be <em>particular </em>and <em>vested, </em>or <em>particular </em>and <em>contingent, </em>or whether it be <em>residuary </em>and vested, or contingent. “ If,” says Judge Lewis, in Seibert’s Appeal, 7 Harris 56, “ there is anything in the argument in favour of awarding interest on a legacy to a child, resting upon the presumption that a parent did not intend his children should starve, the presumption holds with equal strength, where the parent is dead, and the grandchildren are in the will substituted to the legacy previously given to the parent for life. If a testator, by benevolent manifestations, may put himself <em>in loco parentis, </em>so as to entitle a stranger to maintenance, much slighter circumstances will bring the case of a grandchild within the rule. Indeed, this may always be presumed where, as in the case under consideration, the legacy is given to the child only for life, and upon its death the grandchildren are substituted under the express direction in the will to receive the legacy, the income of which had been previously given to their parent.”</p>

The father of the children was living, a-nd the allegation was that his pecuniary abilities were limited, and were altogether inadequate to the maintenance and education of his children and the support of his family. The court made an allowance to the father, Francis P. Corbin, for their past maintenance, of $6000, and for the future maintenance and education of their three children, of $3000 annually, which sum was very largely increased by subsequent decrees of the court as the minors advanced in years. The estate, it is true, was a very large one, consisting of real and personal estate in Pennsylvania and Georgia, which, upon the final distribution and <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>payment to the three grandchildren, under the terms of the will, was valued at near one million of dollars. The case was very stoutly contested by the present Judge Cadwalader and myself, but under our advice the executors of Mr. Hamilton acquiesced in the decision of the Court of Common Pleas without carrying it to the Supreme Court, a course entirely justified by the decision in Seibert’s Appeal fourteen years afterwards.</p>

Eshleman, the sum of $3000, which said sum is to be and remain a lien on my real estate during her natural life, and the interest accruing thereon, to be paid to her annually during her said life; which said interest is to be for her sole and separate use, and not subject to the control of her said husband, nor liable for his debts, either now or hereafter; said legacy to remain a lien upon my real estate during her life, and until her children shall become of lawful age, and at her death the said sum of $3000 to be equally divided amongst her children, if they shall have arrived at the age of twenty-one; but should my daughter die before her children shall have arrived at lawful age, the share that they shall be entitled to shall not be paid until they arrive at lawful age.”</p>

The period mentioned in the last item, when the interest commenced, was the 7th February 1856, all the debts being paid by the executors by that day. William and Charles Alexander accepted the respective farms devised to them by their father, subject amongst other charges to the said legacy of $3000, and are still the owners of the said farms. Mary Eshleman died on the 22d December 1850, leaving no estate, and her husband has no property or means adequate for the proper support of their three minor children, William C., John M., and Mary Elizabeth Eshleman, who, at the time of the presentation of the petition of their <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>guardian to the Orphans’ Court, were aged respectively fourteen, eleven, and nine years.
