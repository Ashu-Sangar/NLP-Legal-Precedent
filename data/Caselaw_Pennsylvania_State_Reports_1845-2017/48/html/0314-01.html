(giving several courses and distances), “ to the Old Noblestown Road, on the property of Henry Dinsmore’s heirs,” with a draft attached, and an assessment of damages, was filed in the clerk’s office May 11th 1861. On the 11th of January 1862 the report was approved by the court, and confirmed May 3d 1862. This writ was then sued out, and it was <em>inter alia </em>assigned for error that the petition and report were defective, in that they did not set forth clearly and distinctly the situation of that part of the old road which it was intended should be vacated and supplied, and that the confirmation of the report, eight months after it was filed, was illegal.</p>

    <p id="b315-6" data-blocks='[["BL_315.4",315,[169,530,1175,605]]]'>In both respects the plain provisions of the Road Law were disregarded. Without a sufficient description of the parts to be vacated, the jurisdiction of the court could not attach, and if it attached it was to be exercised in conformity to the provisions of the law which conferred it. What are public roads, where they begin, and run, and terminate, are determinable from the record of the Quarter Sessions, and a record which referred itself to two hills of a certain grade, and to narrow parts of a road, that road to be abandoned, would scarcely import absolute certainty, for where hills begin and end is often a very difficult question, and would grow more difficult as time effaced the features of the abandoned road. The Act of Assembly contemplates a more certain description, and we have no power to dispense with its requirements.</p>
