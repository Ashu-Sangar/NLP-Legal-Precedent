We find secondly, that Samuel B. Rhodes, one of the sons of Abraham Rhodes, to whom land was devised, paid Henry Wike, on 29th day of December 1859, $51.84, being the interest of that part of the legacy of Nancy Wike which is charged on the land of Samuel B. Rhodes, to June 10th 1860. We find thirdly, that Paul Rhodes, another of the sons of said Abraham Rhodes, to whom land was devised, paid to Henry Wike the sum of $13 on the 15th day of October 1854, on account of interest due Nancy Wike under the will of Abraham Rhodes. We find fourthly, that Jacob Rhodes paid to Henry Wike, on the 24th July 1858, the sum of $3 on account of interest due to Nancy Wike under the will of Abraham Rhodes. If the court be of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the said sum of $1145.52, with the three years’ interest received by the said Henry Wike, and interest since the same was received, then we find for the plaintiff that amount. And if the court be of the opinion that the said sum of $1145.52 ought to be paid to the plaintiff without interest, then we find for the plaintiff the sum of $1145.52. And if the court be of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the said sum of $1145.52, with interest from the time of the death of Henry Wike, to wit, from the 25th May 1861, then we find for the plaintiff the said sum of $1145.52, with interest from the 25th day of May 1861. And if the court. be of the opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to recover the several amounts of interest paid to Henry Wike by Samuel B. Rhodes, Paul Rhodes, and Jacob Rhodes, then we find for the plaintiff the several amounts paid, with interest added, if entitled to recover interest on the same from times of payment. We find that Henry Wike died on the 25th day of May 1861.

The plaintiff in error claims that he was a trustee, and important as this theory is to her case, her counsel has not thought it expedient to illustrate it much by authority or argument, and although it was promised, we have no response by the other side to what has been advanced. Our own investigation has, however, led to the conclusion, that the case was well decided below, and ought to be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b105-10" data-blocks='[["BL_105.12",105,[119,1275,1163,1020]]]'>The testator undoubtedly thought in directing payment of the one-half of the share allowed his daughter by his will to her husband, that he was benefiting her to that extent. The old-fashioned idea, that husband and wife are one in law, and presumed to be a unit in fact in the domestic economy, doubtless had something — everything—to do in the disposition he made. He supposed, therefore, that his bounty placed in the hands of the husband would conduce to the benefit and comfort of the daughter, as well as of himself, and hence without declaring a use, or providing for any final disposition of the fund after the use should expire, and without any fiducial terms whatever being used, he directs the half of what he intended for his daughter to be paid to her husband; the other half he directed to remain in the real estate, the interest to be paid to her during life, and after her decease and that of her husband, if he survive, the principal to her heirs. With such an intelligent and clear distinction thus made, between the moieties of the daughter’s share, there is little room for doubt, that if the testator had intended a trust of both portions he would have said so. After such an exhibition, we cannot do otherwise than believe he fully comprehended the difference between an absolute disposition of the portion and a suspension in trust; and so we see he limits by proper provision the use of the half for life, the other he disposes of absolutely and without limitation.</p>
    <p id="b105-11" data-blocks='[["BL_105.13",105,[119,2305,1157,131]],["BL_106.1",106,[314,406,1160,257]]]'>It is noticeable that the husband of the testator’s daughter, as well as she, was the object of his bounty, for in addition to the provision in the will, for payment to him of half the amount <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>given to her, he provides that, if he survive her, the annual interest of the other half, payable to her during life, shall then be paid to him during life. This is indicative of an equal regard for both, and has some weight in accounting for the absence of any trust expressed, and goes far to negative any supposed implication of a trust as contended for.</p>
    <p id="b106-4" data-blocks='[["BL_106.4",106,[314,664,1157,855]]]'>Doubtless a trust may arise simply out of the declaration of a use, or when it is evidently intended, although apt words be wanting, and especially where the depositary is a stranger in blood or affinity to the parties. There the implication of a trust would seem, in the absence of anything showing a contrary intent, a necessary one; there would be no rational way of accounting otherwise for the provision. The words used in this case, as do the circumstances, exclude the implication contended for. Before the Act of 1848, no question could have arisen in such a case as this. The receipt of the money by the husband without more, would have passed it to him as his own. But this act does not interfere with a father’s right to dispose of his bounty without regard to it: and where it appears that the husband as well as the daughter is an object of his bounty, and he gives to him, without qualification or reserve, the absolute control of, and the right to receive and dispose of a share of the provision for her, we understand that he means to benefit both, and we cannot extract from such a testamentary disposition alone the creation of a trust, or establish one from the mere circumstance of the receipt of the money by the husband.</p>
