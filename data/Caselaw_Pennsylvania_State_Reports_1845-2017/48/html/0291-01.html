      <em>“ </em>In the present case the defendants had complained of trouble in obtaining payment for the lots already delivered, and had positively refused to proceed under the contract on that account. The parties had by their acts — perhaps for mutual convenience and accommodation — relaxed, to some extent, the strict promptness of delivery and payment, or mutuality of performance which the law applies to such contracts; and while such coirrse of performance was pursued without objection, neither party could take advantage of it, to declare the contract forfeited, as was attempted by these defendants. But their notice of forfeiture indicated to the plaintiffs plainly enough that the defendants had abandoned this relaxed course of performance, and thrown themselves on their legal rights. The plaintiffs might well infer from it that defendants would deliver no more oil until what was delivered was paid for, and a readiness on part of plaintiffs to pay at the cars on delivery was clearly shown. After this notice the plaintiffs did pay up arrears promptly, and showed a readiness to receive more, but I fail to perceive in the evidence anything from which a jury might legitimately infer readiness to pay on delivery, otherwise than as payment had theretofore been made, and this relaxed mode the defendants had abandoned on what amounted to due notice. The defendants cannot, therefore, be regarded as in default, until the plaintiffs put themselves in an attitude of readiness for a strict compliance with the requirements of the contract on their part.</p>

And not supposing such point so put to the court would be regarded as a demurrer to evidence in the Supreme Court, especially in view of the rules of this court requiring all points on which instruction is asked to specify the particular <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>matter to which they allude, we did not deem it necessary to ao more than refuse this point. This may have been error, but the question of want of proof of readiness to perform on plaintiffs’ part was never raised on the trial.</p>

      <em>“ </em>I do not think anything new or extraordinary is required by the rule as expressed in Robinson <em>v. </em>Tyson, and in its application to the circumstances of the case in hand, I would not suppose a tender, or even an exhibition of an adequate amount of money necessary, but that in such case it should be shown that adequate funds were on hand or in bank ready to be checked out for the purpose. A difference exists between ability to pay and readiness to pay. Of ability and willingness to pay we think there could be no question, but -we think the case deficient in proof of readiness to pay, and for that reason direct judgment to be entered for the defendants <em>non obstante veredicto.”</em>

    <p id="b298-8" data-blocks='[["BL_298.12",298,[288,1666,1167,515]]]'>Having stated that after a mutual departure from the rigidity of performance, neither party could declare a rescission for past acts, the court said : <em>“ </em>The legal effect of the notice of 14th September was, that if plaintiffs did not pay up arrears for oil already delivered, <em>and thereafter pay as delivered according to the contract, </em>the defendants would hold themselves discharged from any further obligation to perform on their part.” This prepared the way for the final instruction immediately following, to wit: “ Then under this notice did the plaintiffs manifest due diligence, and pay up in reasonable time, under the circumstances, and <em>manifest their intention to hold to their contract and perform it in future on their part ? </em>If so the plaintiffs are entitled to recover.”</p>
    <p id="ANC" data-blocks='[["BL_298.13",298,[289,2181,1166,259]],["BL_299.1",299,[189,411,1163,206]]]'>To manifest an intention to hold to their contract and perform it in future, in view of the preceding instruction and the alternative presented in the following sentence, can mean nothing else than to exhibit to the defendants the intention to pay for the oil in future on delivery. The alternative instruction, which is expository of the former, runs thus: “ On the other hand, if the <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>plaintiffs did not <em>so </em>act, but by tbeir conduct or declarations exhibited a disposition from which it might be inferred they would not <em>pay for the oil as delivered in future, </em>or would not comply with their part of the contract * * * then the plaintiffs are not entitled to recover.”</p>
    <p id="b299-5" data-blocks='[["BL_299.4",299,[189,627,1175,551]]]'>There is a distinction between a willingness to pay and readiness; and the latter may be tested by the production of the money or an offer to pay it. But in this case readiness was not to be tested solely in that way. Neither a tender nor an offer to pay can be required as the legal measure of the proof of readiness in a case where the article is deliverable in lots uncertain in quantity and in time of delivery, implying notice of readiness to deliver, and where inspection of quality and measurement by gauging are prerequisites to payment. Readiness to pay in such a case necessarily falls back upon the intention to pay, as mani-. fested by the conduct and declarations of the party. It was only by manifesting the intention to pay the plaintiffs could evidence their readiness.</p>
    <p id="b299-6" data-blocks='[["BL_299.5",299,[187,1187,1165,691]]]'>The jury, under the charge, have found that the plaintiffs did manifest their intention to hold to their contract, and to perform it in future; and did not by their conduct or declarations exhibit any disposition not to pay on delivery. How else can a party show his readiness to pay upon a contract requiring no positive act at his hands until the article is ready for delivery, of which he is to be notified, unless it be by manifesting to the other party his intention to perform his contract according to its terms ? If the defendants had expressly asked of the plaintiffs, on their demand for more oil, “Will you pay on delivery ?” and they had said, “Yes,” what would this import more than to manifest an intention to pay ? From the language of the instruction, we must infer from the response of the jury, that the plaintiffs gave the defendants to understand, either by their conduct or their declarations, that they would perform their contract, in future, by payment on delivery.</p>
    <p id="b299-7" data-blocks='[["BL_299.6",299,[185,1878,1165,593]]]'>It may be, as stated by the learned judge, in his opinion upon the reserved points, that there was nothing in the evidence from which readiness to pay on delivery could properly be inferred, but under his instruction this was a fact submitted, and, if improperly found, the remedy was a new trial. Had the jury been instructed that there was no sufficient evidence of readiness, as distinguishable from willingness, and the question reserved whether readiness was necessary to a recovery, in addition to willingness, the fact would have been withdrawn, and the legal necessity of its existence reserved as a question of law. But there was error in submitting the fact of readiness to the jury in language that clearly embraced it, and after the fact was found, in entering judgment for the defendants on the ground that the evidence was insufficient.</p>

      <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>Viewing the state of the record, we cannot enter a judgment on the reserved point in favour of the plaintiffs. The court reserved a second question, whether the notice of the 14th September was not such a rescission of the contract as ended it. The readiness of the plaintiffs, after the notice, was of no avail if the contract was legally ended. But the court below, having entered judgment for the defendants on the first point, did not pass upon the second; and the second point, in its express terms, involves the mode of previous performance pursued by both parties. The effect of the notice as an absolute rescission, depended upon the previous conduct of the plaintiffs; but the court below submitted to the jury no questions of fact except “in reference to plaintiffs’ conduct <em>under </em>the rescission notice,” and the amount of damages. After expressly informing the jury that the only questions submitted referred to the conduct of the plaintiffs under the notice, the court declared the legal effect of the notice ■was, to compel the plaintiffs to pay up arrears, and to compel them to perform the contract in future according to its terms. The facts are therefore not before us by any finding which would enable us to decide the question of rescission. The only course left is to reverse the judgment of the court below, and to order a <em>venire facias de novo.</em>
