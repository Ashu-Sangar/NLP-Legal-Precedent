    <p class="summary" id="b384-8" data-blocks='[["BL_384.6",384,[310,843,1164,334]]]'>“The plaintiff’s counsel contends that this is an executory contract, and the grantee being a <em>feme </em>covert, was incapable of contracting, and that the contract thus lacking mutuality could not be enforced against the <em>feme </em>covert, and was therefore void as against the grantor; and this enables him to recover back the land absolutely. On the other hand the defendants’ counsel alleges that the instrument is an absolute conveyance that passes the entire unencumbered estate to his wife.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b384-9" data-blocks='[["BL_384.7",384,[311,1185,1165,904]]]'>“We do not entirely agree with either of these positions. It is manifest that so far as regards the grantee, the performance is executory, and this, together with the entire scope of the instrument, leads us to the conclusion that the paper is executory, leaving the legal title still in the plaintiff, for the purpose of enforcing performance by the grantee. A <em>feme covert </em>may be a purchaser even at common law, or she may be a devisee of an encumbered estate. It is settled that she may be a grantee of an executed estate in Pennsylvania, and give a valid bond and judgment for the purchase-money that will bind the land for payment. If she can thus become the recipient of a legal title, and give collateral securities for the purchase-money, it is difficult to conceive yhy she cannot purchase an equity, and secure the unpaid purchase-money by a stipulation in the instrument itself. Further, the defendants took possession, have made some permanent improvements, and paid a portion of the stipulated consideration. This ejectment by the plaintiff is a substitute for a bill in equity to cancel and rescind the said agreement; and we do not think a chancellor would do so if the plaintiff was otherwise entitled without a previous extinguishment of the equity thus acquired by payment or tender.</p>

If the jury believe the tenders were made at the times due, and properly followed up, they would suspend this interest and prevent a recovery. The jury also, under the contract, are empowered to increase the amount of the annual payments, if they see proper. A tender, to be effectual, must be absolute, coupled with no condition, such as giving receipts.”</p>

In answer to the second the court said: <em>“ </em>If the contract was void or adjudged to be so, and the plaintiff restored to his former right on the premises, doubtless a chancellor would mould the decree’so as to do full equity. But we do not think a chancellor would move at all until the plaintiff seeking to rescind had done or offered to do everything required to extinguish any equity in the defendants. A chancellor having this power, it might be exercised by a jury under the direction of the court in a proper case. But as we do not deem this a void contract, nor this case one that equity can justly rescind, the form of the decree becomes immaterial. The point is therefore answered in the negative.”</p>

The rule stated in Sherman’s Lessee <em>v. </em>Dill, <a href="/yeates/4/0298-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Yeates 298" data-case-ids="6773079" data-case-paths="/yeates/4/0298-01">4 Yeates 298</a>, and by Sergeant, J., in Kenrick <em>v. </em>Smick, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2045" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 45">7 W. &amp; S. 45</a>, and Strong, J., in Ogden <em>v. </em>Brown, 9 Casey 249, is, that from the intention of the parties, as collected from the instrument itself, we must judge whether the writing is an executed conveyance or only executory. Where it is doubtful upon its face, light may be shed upon it by the attending circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b385-10" data-blocks='[["BL_385.14",385,[170,2038,1160,385]],["BL_386.1",386,[306,400,1158,131]]]'>In determining this intention, <em>ex visceribus, </em>the first rule is to inquire whether the language imports a present conveyance, or whether, collecting all its parts, it contemplates a further assurance to pass the title: Grey <em>v. </em>Packer, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 17" data-case-ids="1856549" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0017-01">4 W. &amp; S. 17</a>; Garver <em>v. </em>McNulty, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20484" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Wright 484">3 Wright 484</a>. The instrument in the case before us, both in the granting part and in the <em>habendum and tenendum, </em>uses the ordinary formal language of a deed of conveyance, and most distinctly conveys the title, in the usual mode by the past and present tense. Now, unless this express language is coun<a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>teryailed by some other part of the writing, or by some fact or circumstance set forth in it, no conclusion can be drawn contrary to its explicit terms.</p>
    <p id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[297,529,1165,816]]]'>The only fact that appears, from which any inference can be drawn, is, that the consideration expressed is to be paid in future annually during the lives of John Bortz and Eve his wife, with a provision for increase or reduction in case the annual sum should be too little or too much for their support in their customary manner of living. But no inference as to the character of the conveyance can be legally drawn from the fact of future payment, unaccompanied, as here, by any conditions, covenants, or restrictions relating to the title, to restrain its present passing. It has been well said by Lowrie, C. J., in Nease’s Appeal, 7 Casey 294, and by Thompson, J., in Garver <em>v. </em>McNulty, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20483" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Wright 483">3 Wright 483</a>, that the instrument may be executed as to one party and executory only as to the other. This was manifestly the character of the instruments in the cases of Cook <em>v. </em>Trimble, <a href="/watts/9/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="9 Watts 15" data-case-ids="1850015" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0015-01">9 Watts 15</a>, Gray <em>v. </em>Packer, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0017-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 17" data-case-ids="1856549" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0017-01">4 W. &amp; S. 17</a>, Hepburn <em>v. </em>Snyder, 3 Barr 72, and Garver <em>v. </em>McNulty, above referred to. In all these cases, these writings were decided to be executed conveyances by the grantor, while the grantee’s covenants for the consideration were executory.</p>
    <p id="b386-7" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[290,1346,1159,641]]]'>In Cook <em>v. </em>Trimble, <a href="/watts/9/0015-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="9 Watts 15" data-case-ids="1850015" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0015-01">9 Watts 15</a>, the conveyance was in consi deration of $160 and a comfortable support and living, to be given to the grantor, his wife and daughter, during their natural lives. This case is an authority upon another point, which touches the construction of the writing, to wit, that the stipulation for a living imported no condition, but was merely the recital of the consideration. Garver <em>v. </em>McNulty is an authority directly in point in this case. There the instrument was an agreement, was signed by both parties, and contained a condition precedent, that the grantee was to furnish the grantor with another house and garden. In the opinion of the court, delivered by Thompson, J., none of these features were deemed sufficient to take from the instrument its character as an executed conveyance. It was also in consideration of a comfortable support during natural life.</p>
