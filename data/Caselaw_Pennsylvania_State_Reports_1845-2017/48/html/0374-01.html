He made the application to the regular agent, he gave the premium note for $250, paid the percentage and the cost, and, in due course, received this policy. If the matter rested here, it is probable there would have been less difficulty, perhaps no hesitation to pay. But it is contended that there was a false and fraudulent misrepresentation made by Mitchell to Mr. Sampson, the agent, by his answer to the question as to encumbrances, and that, in his application in writing, he said in substance, there were no encumbrances.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b376-10" data-blocks='[["BL_376.8",376,[297,1619,1158,802]]]'>“ [I do not view the declaration of Mitchell, in the application, as a warranty, which requires a strict and literal compliance and performance, but a representation merely. If that representation, however, was false and fraudulent, and of a nature calculated to mislead and deceive, it would equally avoid the policy, as a false warranty. Whether there was a falsehood in this case is for the jury. From the evidence, it appears there was. He answered in the written application that there were no encumbrances, whereas the evidence of the records shows very clearly there were quite a large number. Was this misrepresentation fraudulent? Was it calculated to deceive in a matter which the company deemed material? Was it wilful on his part, or simply the result of inadvertence ? These are questions for the jury.] Its falsity, if the jury believe it, is a strong presumption of a sinister purpose and fraudulent design, but if the jury believe that the evidence rebuts that presumption and discloses an innocent purpose, they may so find it. If it was false and fraudulent, the policy would have been void in the hands of Mitchell, and if loss had occurred then he could not have recovered.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b377-6" data-blocks='[["BL_377.4",377,[185,462,1168,851]]]'>“ A void contract is one that has no validity whatever, as being against the policy of the law, or for other reasons, rendering it of no binding force. But a contract that is fraudulent and may be avoided by the party defrauded, is good as 'to all other persons; and the guilty party, not being permitted to take advantage of his own wrong, is bound by it. It is, therefore, only the party wronged or cheated that can avoid It, and as to him and him alone it is invalid. It may turn out to be for his benefit, in which case he may treat it as good, and hold the other party bound. A private contract in general, in which the parties alone are interested, is, therefore, only voidable, not absolutely void; and as such we view this policy. If, at any period of Mitchell’s ownership, the company alleged they were deceived and desired to avoid the policy, they could do so, if deceived by the hand of Mitchell. But they might ratify it, by agreeing to subsequent transfers to innocent assignees, and if they did so ratify it, with a knowledge of the facts, made known, either to the company or their agent, after such ratification they would be bound by the agreement in the hands of a <em>bond fide </em>holder.</p>

We think that if the case rested on the policy in the hands of Mitchell, that the falsehood in the application, standing alone, would raise a presumption of fraud and would avoid the policy. But the jury may find the representation to have been an inadvertence, if the evidence satisfies them to that effect. If the jury find the policy to have been good in the hands of Mitchell, then there is an end of this case, [but if invalid in his hands, if the jury believe it was transferred to Ralston &amp; Co. and by them to Ellis &amp; Hoffman— that they were innocent holders and assignees — and that was duly ratified by the company, by approving of the transfer, and that they paid all the assessments demanded by the company from them, it would be a ratification, and they would be bound.]</p>

The first point was constructed in view of the answer of Mitchell to the question in the application respecting encumbrances being a warranty ; and asked the court therefore to say that the fact of existing encumbrances avoided the policy as a matter of law. The answer of the court leaving it to the jury as a question of fraud in fact, was correct. And viewing it as a false representation, as it undoubtedly was, the answer of the court was not erroneous. It is to be taken in connection with the general charge, in which the law is fairly stated to the jury, giving to the defendant below every advantage upon the facts, if the answer of Mitchell were found to be false, fraudulent, and material; all of which was necessary to avoid the policy on the ground of misrepresentation.</p>

Without that consent there could be no lawful assignment, hut further than this we discover nothing calling upon the assignee to state the encumbrances. If there be anything in the act of incorporation or by-laws, it has not been set forth.
