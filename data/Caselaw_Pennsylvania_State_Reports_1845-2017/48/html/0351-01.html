Rose, as also for the support, maintenance, and education of such children as may be born to the first and second parties during their marriage, and then after other trusts, which have become immaterial, proceeds: “ but if the second party should survive the first, then the third party shall forthwith deliver over, transfer, and reconvey to the second party all her estate, and the income remaining in their hands, and cause the same to be reinvested in her in perpetuity, as completely and fully as they may have and hold the same.” The trustees are given power to employ and pay agents, and to retain a suitable compensation for their trouble and services, and the third party declare and agree with the first and second parties, to accept the estate and trusts thereby created, “ and when the said trusts come to am end according to the limitation therein expressed, they will convey, release, and transfer the estate hereby vested in them, in the manner and to the persons and for the uses and purposes hereby designated.”</p>
