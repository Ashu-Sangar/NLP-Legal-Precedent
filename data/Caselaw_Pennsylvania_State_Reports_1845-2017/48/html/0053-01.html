But the allegation is, that the legislature having, by an Act of Assembly passed the 20th March 1845, provided a specific remedy for the injury complained of, the common law remedy by indictment cannot be resorted to. Now, if this position be correct, the demurrer is sustained, because, in this view, the bill <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>does not allege an offence punishable by indictment. It is contended, however, by the counsel for the Commonwealth, that the remedy provided by the Act of 1845 is but cumulative, and does not supersede the common law remedy by indictment. The act referred to is in these words: ‘ It shall not be lawful for any railroad company to block up the passage of any crossings of public streets or roads, or obstruct the said crossings with their locomotives or cars; and if any engineer or other agent of any railroad company shall obstruct or block up such crossings, he or they shall be subject to a penalty of $25, to be recovered with costs in the name of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, before a justice of the peace; one half of such penalty shall be paid to the informer or informers, and the remaining half shall bo paid into the treasury of the Commonwealth: <em>Provided, </em>That in the event of such engineer or agent being unable to pay the said penalty, then and in that ease the said railroad company employing the said engineer or agent shall pay the penalty aforesaid.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b54-6" data-blocks='[["BL_54.4",54,[320,1159,1161,1105]]]'>“ The Act of 1806 ordains that ‘in all cases where a remedy is provided or duty enjoined, or anything directed to be done by any Act or Acts of Assembly of this Commonwealth, the directions of the acts shall be strictly pursued, and no penalty shall be inflicted or anything done agreeably to the provisions of the common law in such cases further than shall be necessary for carrying such act or acts into effect.’ This act is introduced <em>verbatim </em>into the new Penal Code of 1860, and thus its provisions are made applicable to both civil and criminal cases. If, then, a remedy has been provided by the Act of 1845 for the injury complained of, the offence charged is not indictable, but the act providing for the recovery of a penalty in a <em>qui tarn </em>action must be strictly pursued. It seems to us that the injury provided for by the Act of 1845 is not distinctly set forth in the indictment, as was the case in Kelly <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 11 S. &amp; R. 845, but, on the contrary, the nuisance complained of consists in the commission of the very acts for which a penalty is provided by the Act of 1845. The indictment charges that the defendant obstructed the highway by allowing the cars to stand upon the crossing, and the statute forbids any railroad company to block up the passage of any crossings of public streets or roads, or to obstruct the said crossings with their locomotives or cars, under a penalty of $25. We are unable to discover wherein the offence stated in the bill differs from that mentioned in the statute, and we are therefore of the opinion that this indictment cannot be sustained.</p>

Orvis, </em>for the Commonwealth. — In the decision of this case the court sustained the demurrer, on the ground that a specific remedy was provided for the injury complained of, by the Act of the 20th of March 1845, and therefore the common law remedy by indictment could not be resorted to. The decision of this case depends upon the construction of the Act of the 21st of March 1806, and whether the common law remedy is absorbed by this statute. The obstruction of a highway is an offence at common law, which the Act of the 20th of March 1845 did not extinguish. The procedure by indictment at common law is still in force in Pennsylvania, notwithstanding the cumulative remedies given by statute. An indictment for nuisance is not within the provisions of the Act of 1806, although a statutory remedy be provided: Kelly <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 11 S. &amp; R. 346.</p>
    <p id="b55-9" data-blocks='[["BL_55.9",55,[150,1395,1162,469]]]'>The Act of 1806 only applies when a specific method of procedure is directed by Act of Assembly; for when a new penalty is attached to a common law offence, then the indictment may still be at common law. The obstruction of a public highway being an indictable offence prior to the Act of the 20th of March 1845, that act did not create a new offence, but merely imposed an additional penalty for an existing offence.
