D. 1857, the Lancaster conveyed to Horace Rathvon all its estate, real, personal, and mixed, “ in trust for payment of all the just debts of said Lancaster Bank.” This conveyance was recorded on the 5th February, A. D. 1857, and tbe trustee therein named entered upon the performance of the duties of the trust in the mode usually practised in cases of assignment hy individuals for the benefit of their creditors; and, after one or more partial accounts, on the 1st day of January, A. d. 1862, filed his final account. The validity or efficacy of this appropriation of the property of the bank was not contested by either the stockholders or creditors of <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>the institution; but in behalf of certain of the creditors repeated efforts were made to use the agency of the trustee for the enforcement of the liabilities imposed upon stockholders and directors, by the 15th and 23d sections of the Act of Assembly of 7th April 1849, entitled an act to “ extend the charter of the Lancaster Bank.” The first was by petition to the Common Pleas of the county of Lancaster for <em>mandamus </em>to the directors of the bank, commanding them to file in the office of the prothonotary of the county the statement of the affairs of the bank, required by the 25th section of the Act of 1849, when a bank is compelled to make an assignment. The court refused to grant the prayer of the petition, on the ground that the provisions of that section were applicable only to a compulsory assignment, while that of the bank was a voluntary one under the Act of March 12th, 1842. Subsequently suits were brought, by creditors in the name of the assignee, against a number of persons who had been directors of the bank, for their proportional shares of the loss which had accrued by reason of the insolvency of the institution under the 23d section of the Act of 1749; in all of which cases the assignee filed disclaimers, and asked and obtained the leave of court to discontinue. Under the exceptions filed to this final account, it was urged that the refusal of the trustee to take any step for the enforcement of the liabilities of the stockholders and directors of the bank, as provided by the 15th and 23d sections of the Act of 1849, was a failure in the performance of his duty which rendered him liable to an amount equal to that which might have been realized, if he had proceeded to enforce those liabilities.

The general history of our banks up to the failure of the Bank of Pennsylvania, in 1858, is succinctly stated in The Bank of Pennsylvania <em>v. </em>Spangler, 8 Casey 474, and it is not necessary to repeat the details here. It may, however, be observed that from 1823 to 1849, the great object of the legislature seems to have been to provide for, and if possible prevent the suspension of specie payments by the banks by penalties and forfeitures of their charters, which in practice were found entirely inadequate in the general suspensions of 1837 and 1839. The joint resolution of the 3d April 1840, provided for the resumption of specie payments by the banks on the 15th January 1841, but was rendered inoperative by the total failure of the Bank of the United States. This resolution was repealed by the 17th section of the Act of 4th May 1841, and on the 12th March 1842, an act was passed to provide for the resumption of specie payments by the banks of this Commonwealth, and for other purposes. The 2d section provided for certain proceedings in the courts, and a consequent compulsory assignment by the directors, or the appointment of trustees by the court, and the 3d section allowed the directors tc make a general assignment, subject to the conditions and provisions relating to assignments by directors of banks, provided in the 2d section. The Act of 1849 was intended to be an improvement on the former system, but has entirely failed of its objects by not extending the provisions consequent upon a compulsory assignment to all assignments, whether voluntary or otherwise.</p>

The 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th sections provide for the mode of enforcing this liability by the assignees. The 23d section provides for the liability of the directors to the creditors of the bank, in case of a wilfully fraudulent insolvency, and the 24th section defines what shall be deemed a fraudulent insolvency, whilst the 25th section -provides that <em>“ the term </em>insolvency, <em>used in this </em>act, <em>shall be construed to apply to this bank when it is compelled to make an assignment,” </em>and then follow various provisions in that section, and in the 26th, 27th, and 28th sections, applicable to the case of such compulsory assignments.</p>
