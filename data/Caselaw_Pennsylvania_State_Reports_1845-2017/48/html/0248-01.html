    <p id="b250-8" data-blocks='[["BL_250.8",250,[257,965,1170,1030]]]'>A sheriff’s sale of the property of the firm is entirely consistent with the continuance of the firm. It is nowhere decided that a mere sheriff’s sale works a dissolution. A sheriff’s sale of the whole of a partner’s interest works a dissolution : Collyer on Part. § 112. So also levy and sale of one of the partner’s effects, works a dissolution <em>pro tanto: </em>Story on Part. 443. Why ? Because it is the necessary consequence of the transfer of the property to the vendee of the sheriff as tenant in common with the solvent partner: Coll, on Part. § 112. But if any of the partnership effects were left after sale, there can be no doubt that the partnership would continue. Partnership effects might be sold on execution, and the firm at the same time be solvent. If sheriff’s sale, therefore, would be notice of dissolution of an insolvent firm, the effect ought to be the same in the case of a solvent one. No one will hold that it would have that effect in the latter case. Why, then, have it in the former ? If a sheriff’s sale is not <em>per se </em>a dissolution of the partnership, it seems to us that it cannot be notice of such dissolution. In all cases except death and bankruptcy notice must be given: Coll, on Part. § 120; Story on Part. 336; because, in the one case, it would be impossible to give such notice, and in the other the law has actually declared the firm insolvent, and therefore dissolved. But it is not so in case of a sheriff’s sale, that being perfectly consistent with solvency.</p>

On the contrary, the evidence of the defendants themselves goes to show that Colvin had not this authority, he having left the old place of business, and gone into the employ of Kirk Lewis. One or both of the partners must have had authority to conclude the unsettled affairs of the firm. If, therefore, this authority is not shown to have been in Colvin, it must, in the absence of proof to the contrary, be held to exist in Smitley, the partner who exercised it.

In the present suit, all the property of the partnership was sold by the sheriff under a judgment and execution against the firm in January 1852, and they were “ completely cleaned out” and entirely insolvent. The firm entirely disappeared, and the business was carried on by the person who purchased the property at sheriff’s sale, under the <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>name of F.

On the 1st July 1855, Smitley gave a new note payable five years after date, and signed it “ Smitley &amp; Colvin, per S.
