In the 1st article he names her the sole and only heir of all his property, present and future, as well realty as personalty, of which he may be the owner at the time of his death. Even before the Act of 1833, this language would have conferred a fee upon Mrs. Jauretche: Ferguson <em>v. </em>Zepp, 4 W. C. C.

    <p id="b469-7" data-blocks='[["BL_469.7",469,[199,1095,1165,290]]]'>What is there, in the subsequent passages of the will, to impair the effect of this general devise ? In the 2d article the testator expresses a desire that his estate at Cambo should not be sold, if his wife can do otherwise. So far from being restrictive, this plainly recognises the absolute proprietorship of the wife, and merely expresses a preference, to be followed or not, as she may think best under all the circumstances.</p>
    <p id="b469-8" data-blocks='[["BL_469.8",469,[197,1397,1166,304]]]'>The 3d article is obscure; but in its plain reading, it is not only compatible with the absolute ownership of the wife, but incompatible with any other meaning. It is as if he had said, “ I give you all my estate, but don’t divest yourself of it until after your death, when you can leave it as you think proper.” He seems to have been apprehensive that his widow might be induced to part with some of the estate to her disadvantage.</p>
    <p id="b469-9" data-blocks='[["BL_469.9",469,[195,1700,1166,430]]]'>That this language was merely directory, and not mandatory, is plain from the 2d article. Had he meant to restrict his wife positively from selling, he would not have expressed a wish that the Cambo plantation should not be sold if she could do otherwise. Again: in the 4th article, at the death of his wife, what he might have left her, that is to say, the residue, was to be divided equally among the children. What is the import of residue? Surely that which should be left after she had spent and used what she wanted. On this point we have high authority in our own state.</p>

It was there held that, where a testator devised to his wife his real estate for life, and his personalty absolutely, “ having full confidence she will leave the surplus to be divided at her decease justly among my children,” the widow took the absolute ownership in the personalty, overruling Me<a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>Konkey’s Appeal, 1 Harris 253, and Coates’s Appeal, 2 Barr 129. The word surplus, it was decided, meant what was left of personal estate unconsumed, or undisposed of by the widow in her lifetime, and not the balance left after payment of testator’s debts. The following English cases may be consulted on this point: Lechmere <em>v. </em>Lavie, 2 Mylne &amp; Keen 197; Pope <em>v. </em>Pope, 10 Sim. 1; Knight <em>v. </em>Knight, 3 Beav. 148; Pushman <em>v. </em>Pilliter, 3 Ves.

    <p id="b470-6" data-blocks='[["BL_470.4",470,[270,740,1166,818]]]'>In the present will, residue has the same meaning as surplus. It could mean nothing but what was left, after the widow had spent what she might think proper to do. It is therefore argued that no design is anywhere apparent on the face of the will to impair the fulness of the devise and bequest made to the wife in the 5th article; on the contrary, there is strong evidence on its face that the testator desired to impose no restriction of absolute ownership, or to imply it. He would have preferred that a certain piece of property should be kept until after his wife’s death ; but this wish was not to be carried into effect unless with her consent, and without derogation to her absolute rights. Any residue left he wished divided among his children equally — a wish quite consistent with absolute ownership in the wife. If, however, legally inconsistent with the wife’s paramount rights, the latter must prevail. Nowhere is intention shown to cut down the absolute fee-simple interest, given to the wife, to a life estate. The comprehensive terms of gift, used in the 1st article, should therefore prevail, and the widow, it is submitted, is entitled to the whole estate, and can sell to a purchaser in fee simple.</p>

The paramount thought in the testator’s mind was to make his wife absolute owner of his estate, and he expressed this thought by sufficient words; but the particular thought was to take away from her one of the incidents of absolute ownership — in other words, that he would grant a fee, with power of testamentary disposition, but would withhold the power of alienation.</p>
    <p id="b471-8" data-blocks='[["BL_471.5",471,[200,1228,1168,767]]]'>That this was his meaning is further apparent from the 4th article, which, in giving the “residue” over to the children, implied the right of consumption in the wife. This word residue, as used in this place, does not imply a residuum of estate or interest like a remainder, but a residuum of the property — or, in the testator’s own language, of “what I may have left her,” and in this sense is exactly equivalent to “ surplus,” a word which was fully considered and expounded in Pennock’s Estate, 8 Harris 282. It was there said, upon the authority of several English cases, that where it c.an be implied from the will that a discretion is left to withdraw any part of the subject of the devise from the object of the wish or request, or to apply it to the use of the devise, no trust is created, but an absolute right to use and consume exists. As the word surplus in the devise over in that case was held to imply a right in the first taker to consume the whole, so the word residue here implies that the testator’s wife was to enjoy his estate with no other restraint than that of alienation.</p>

Now, a power of alienation is necessarily and inseparably incident to an estate in fee, and therefore if lands be devised to A. and his heirs, upon condition that he shall not alien, the condition. is void: 4 Kent 131; McWilliams <em>v. </em>Nisely, 2 S. &amp; R. 513; Schummacher <em>v. </em>Negus, <a href="/denio/1/0448-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Denio 448" data-case-ids="484076" data-case-paths="/denio/1/0448-01">1 Denio 448</a>.
