While living, he carried on the several occupations of bricklayer and glass manufacturer. At the time of his death intestate and without wife or children; he left surviving him the following relatives upon whom his estate, if solvent, would descend: Hannah Yearsley, his mother; Washington and Townsend Yearsley, his brothers; Sarah, wife of Isaac Gilpin, and Hannah Yearsley, his sisters; and William, John, Mary, and Elizabeth Yearsley, children of a deceased brother George. His property consisted of both real and personal estate; the present account, however, containing items of the latter description only. Townsend Yearsley presented three several claims against the estate.

The books of the decedent furnished no evidence of any charge against Townsend Yearsley. As to the remaining sum $500, constituting this loan, it was proved by the day and cash book of P. Yearsley, verified by the testimony of his book-keeper.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b532-15" data-blocks='[["BL_532.13",532,[278,1300,1164,771]]]'>The second claim of Townsend Yearsley was for seven hundred and ninety days’ work, from April 25th 1852 to December 23d 1854, at $2.50 per diem. To support this the claimant produced his own book of original entries, in which he was accustomed to set down every Saturday night the number of days’ work which he had performed during that week, with the amount of cash, if any, which he had received during that time. He had been employed by his brother as superintendent of his glass-works in Wood street near Broad; was generally there from daylight until eleven o’clock at night, and frequently stayed there all night and on Sundays. No express contract was proved, nor was any rate of compensation agreed upon; but it appeared in evidence that some time before the commencement of the period for which the claim was made, Mr. Townsend Yearsley received from his brother $2.25 per day for carpenter work, and the opinion of an intelligent witness, who frequently visited the glass-works, and who was himself a manufacturer, was, that such service as the claimant rendered was worth $4 per day.</p>

The last item of <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>charge upon the first claim was made July 3d 1852, and on the second, December 23d 1854. To rebut the presumption there was offered in evidence the books of Pascal Yearsley for the purpose of showing a running account, and entries were there proved in Pascal Yearsley’s handwriting for cash paid his brother at sundry times, and extending down as late as 1856. In addition to this, a paper was produced, dated February 20th 1858, signed and sealed by P. Yearsley, and found among his papers at his death, in which he recites that for the part satisfaction of a claim against him by Townsend Yearsley, he assigns to th§ said Townsend a claim which he has against the managers of the House of Refuge for $1166.33. A suit was also brought by T. Yearsley against the decedent in the District Court to March T. 1860, No. 1334, on which there was personal service upon the defendant, and an appearance entered by Mr. Deckert for him. This suit, though still on the docket, was never prosecuted, by reason of several ineffectual efforts to come to an amicable settlement.</p>

    <p id="b534-6" data-blocks='[["BL_534.4",534,[277,499,1166,261]]]'>The auditor decided, on abundant evidence, that the item on the debit side of $3003.23 for money loaned was correct, but for the other two items he relied on Townsend Yearsley’s books, and from the manner of keeping them he rejected the first item for eighty-five weeks of board, but allowed the other item for seven hundred and ninety days of work.</p>
    <p id="b534-7" data-blocks='[["BL_534.5",534,[278,759,1165,426]]]'>He then allowed the credits and thus struck the balance, to which Townsend Yearsley was entitled. Upon exceptions to his report the court decided that the book ought to have been wholly rejected — neither debit nor credit allowed — which left Townsend Yearsley’s item of $3003.23 for borrowed money unimpaired, and which, with interest added, amounted to more than the balance Townsend claimed against his brother’s estate. Thus, the cash item $3000, and interest as stated by auditor, $1966, amounted to $4966. From which deduct the balance claimed by Townsend, $3549.22, and the difference is $1416.78.</p>
    <p id="b534-8" data-blocks='[["BL_534.6",534,[278,1188,1165,249]]]'>These figures would be a little affected by the interest counted up to the time of the several audits; but it, is apparent from them that the effect of sustaining the exceptions to the auditor’s first report was to establish Townsend Yearsley’s debt against his brother’s estate at some $1400 beyond what he stated it himself.</p>
    <p id="b534-9" data-blocks='[["BL_534.7",534,[277,1447,1166,300]]]'>It never can be right to allow a creditor of a decedent more than he claims. All experience proves that the accounts which the living state against the dead are large enough. Very often, indeed, estates are exposed to false and exaggerated demands, of which, however, we see no evidence in this case; but where a creditor has made no mistake in his figures, it cannot be a sound judgment that awards him $1400 more than he asks for.</p>
    <p id="b534-10" data-blocks='[["BL_534.8",534,[278,1747,1166,688]],["BL_535.1",535,[201,418,1184,167]]]'>We think the court erred in not confirming the auditor’s first report. The claim presented to an administrator or an auditor is, in itself, no evidence against the decedent’s estate, but if the administrator claims the benefits of the credits therein stated, he makes the paper <em>primd facie </em>evidence of the debits also. He cannot treat part of the paper as an admission and reject the rest. It is evidence of nothing, or of all it contains. But the administrator may question the debits and disprove them if he can. Such a sworn statement is only <em>primd facie, </em>evidence, and is open to inquiry and contradiction. And when the auditor went to the creditor’s books and found no adequate charge of the board bill, he did right in rejecting it, though it was in the sworn statement. When from the books he found the seven hundred and ninety days of labour charged, and heard what was proved in support of that charge, he did right in sustaining it, and the credits were properly allowed of course, for they were sworn to <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>by Townsend Yearsley. The auditor seemed to doubt, and the court doubted still more, whether the book was so kept as to be adequate evidence of the work, but we have no doubt on that' head.</p>

Mr. Dodge, an intelligent witness, who frequently visited the glass-works, and was himself a manufacturer, swore ■that such services as the accountant rendered were worth $4 a day; yet he charged but $2.50.

In connection with the evidence before the auditor, we think the book account was properly received for the work and the credits.
