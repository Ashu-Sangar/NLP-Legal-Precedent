That was the case of an executed conveyance by a vendor, half the purchase-money received, and bonds taken for the other half, but no judgments entered on the bonds. Under judgments subsequently obtained against the vendee, the land was sold at sheriff’s sale, and the vendor claimed the unpaid balance of his purchase-money out of the proceeds of the sale. The masterly opinion of Judge Gibson showed that the doctrine of equitable liens had grown up in England since the foundation of the colonies, and therefore that our ancestors did not bring it with them ; that it was opposed to the policy of our legislation; that it was not recognised in the practice of-our courts, and that it accorded with neither the professional nor the popular understanding. “ The implication,” he added, “ that there is an intention to reserve a lien for the purchase-money in all cases where the parties do not by express acts evince a contrary intention is, in almost every case, inconsistent with the truth of the fact, and in all instances without exception, in contradiction of the express terms of the contract, which purports to be a conveyance of everything that can pass. The construction, therefore, which, independently of fraud or mistake, reserves an interest against the express language of the parties, is unnatural and unjust.”</p>

The formal acknowledgment of its receipt would imply a fully-executed contract on the part of the vendee, and delivery of the deed imported full execution on the part of the vendor. Between parties whose writings wore such a face there was no ground for implying unexecuted covenants, or liens to secure performance of them. But in Bear <em>v. </em>Whisler, <a href="/watts/7/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 Watts 144" data-case-ids="1846813" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0144-01">7 Watts 144</a>, we <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>have a conveyance of the legal title, “ subject nevertheless to the conditions and obligations contained- in a certain article of agreement between the parties bearing date the 13th March last.” The agreement here referred to bound the vendee to pay six several bonds of $80 each, and to support the vendor and wife for life. The point ruled was, that the deed was a conveyance on condition, which any party in interest might enforce by ejectment. And this was really all that the case decided; but Judge Rogers took occasion to allude to the doctrine of equitable liens, and approved of the ruling in Kauffelt <em>v. </em>Bower, but intimated that parties may create such a lien, by clear and express words, so as to be binding between themselves and privies.</p>
    <p id="b101-6" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[153,926,1165,1449]]]'>The next year the case of Stewartson <em>v. </em>Watts, <a href="/watts/8/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="8 Watts 392" data-case-ids="1848380" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0392-01">8 Watts 392</a>, came up. Here was an express charge of the purchase-money upon the land, which was also secured by a mortgage, and a sheriff’s sale on judgment junior to the mortgage. The sale occurred before the Act of the 6th April 1830, and the court held the lien, whether created by the words of the deed or the mortgage, to be divested by that sale. Judge Rogers vindicated, with great force of argument, the policy that judicial sales should pass property clear of all liens, but he said the court had yielded to certain exceptions which may be reduced to three: 1st. Where liens are created by last wills and testaments as permanent provisions for wives and children; 2d. Where from, the nature of the encumbrance it will not readily admit of valuation ; and 3d. Where it is plain from the agreement of the parties that the encumbrance was intended to run with the land. Under one or the other of these heads it was manifestly intended that every lien should fall which was to be-saved by judicial decision from the ordinary effects of sheriff’s sales. Mortgages and certain other liens were saved by statutes. In the eases of The Episcopal Academy <em>v. </em>Frieze, <a href="/watts/2/0016-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Watts 16" data-case-ids="1840058" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0016-01">2 Watts 16</a>, Barnitz <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20145" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 145">1 W. &amp; S. 145</a>, we have instances of liens created by the agreement of parties, and divested by sheriff’s sales on subsequent liens, so that we are not to forget that something more than the creation of a lien by agreement is necessary to make it survive a sheriff’s sale; it must be expressly charged upon the land as an encumbrance manifestly intended to run with it. Bury <em>v. </em>Sieber, 5 Barr 432, was ruled on the doctrine of McCall <em>v. </em>Lennox, 9 S. &amp; R. 310, which was the case of tacking one security to another, whereby a subsequent encumbrance was saved by relation to a prior one, quite a different subject from that we are upon.

How, in view of this state of the law, our immediate question is, whether reciting on the face of the title that the purchase-money remains unpaid, and is to be paid annually, creates such a lien. In Neas’s Appeal' an intention to create a lien was inferred from the fact that the purchase-money stood in the title. But according to all the antecedent cases, express words were necessary to establish the lien. It never before was treated as a subject for legal implication, and it is manifestly a hazardous inference to make; for the pecuniary consideration, essential to all bargains and sales, is generally mentioned on the face of the deed, and if it be said to be unpaid, it is notice of <em>that fact </em>to a subsequent purchaser, but it is no notice to him of a lien. He may reasonably infer that the vendor trusted the personal credit of his vendee for the purchase-money, or took bonds and mortgages or other security, or at the least, that no lien was intended to be created by the deed because none was expressed. These inferences would seem quite as reasonable as that the parties meant what they did not express — a lien for the unpaid money. When the ill consequences of constructive liens are considered, and it is observed how the legislature and the courts have laboured to furnish record notice of liens, it is going very far to say that parties may, even by their express agreement, create a valid lien, but much too far to imply it from mere notice of non-payment of purchase-money, and very much too far to imply a lien, from that single fact, of such tenaciousness that a sheriff’s sale will not divest it. Yet all this must be implied, to support the lien claimed in this case. If notice of unpaid purchase-money be sufficient to create a lien, Kauffelt <em>v. </em>Bower ought to have been differently ruled, for the purchaser there had such notice, but the court refused, for the most solid reasons, to imply a lien.</p>

The policy of the law forbids us to surmise or imagine such an intention.
