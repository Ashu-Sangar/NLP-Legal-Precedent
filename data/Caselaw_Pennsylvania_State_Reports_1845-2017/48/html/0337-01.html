Afterwards the Common Pleas made a decree in accordance with our decision, that the trustee should distribute it to the claim of Samuel Garrison on his mortgage, and the surplus in his hands, to the general creditors, being something over three hundred dollars.

This will not do. They were by their bond bound that their principal should “ faithfully execute the trust confided to him,” otherwise their obligation was to remain good against them. The decision of this court gave him the money in question as assignee, and the Common Pleas decreed that as such assignee he should distribute it, not, it is true, to the general creditors, but to a creditor who by law, under the assignment, became entitled to it. The failure to do so was a breach of his bounden duty. The duty was fixed by a competent tribunal, and their judgment cannot be tested collaterally by the bail. Perhaps they might have appealed from the decree of distribution, and contested the matter directly; but this they did not do, and they are bound by it, and cannot now say that the decree was erroneously made against him as assignee.
