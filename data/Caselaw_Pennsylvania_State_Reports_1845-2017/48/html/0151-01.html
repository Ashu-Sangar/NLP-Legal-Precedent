It was for one year, and covered $1000 upon the hotel furniture, beds, &amp;c., of the “Belvidere” Hotel, a few miles from Pittsburgh, $500 upon the liquors and bar fixtures, and $500 upon a barn near the hotel, making in all a risk of $2000, in consideration of a premium of $30. The house was separately insured for $5000. A fire occurred in the hotel on September 28th 1860, between two and three o’clock in the morning. The house was entirely consumed, as was also most of the furniture. The house was occupied at the time by Mr. Eichenlaub, a son-in-law of the plaintiff, and had been on fire a few months previously.</p>

Defendants also pleaded a failure on the part of the assured to comply with a clause in the policy, requiring her to give immediate notice of loss, and to furnish a schedule of the articles destroyed or damaged, and also pleaded the precedency of sundry execution attachments served upon them as garnishees in judgments against the assured. Defendants also set forth in their pleas, Condition No. 3 in their policy, to wit: “ If any person in obtaining insurance on his, her, or their buildings or goods, shall make any untrue representation, or neglect to disclose the nature and amount of all encumbrances, in case any exist thereon, whether of bond, judgment, mortgage, or liens of every other description, or cause the same to be described in the policy otherl wise than they really are, said insurance shall be void and of no effect.” And averred that this condition had not been complied with, that untrue representations were made, that there were numerous encumbrances upon the property insured at the <a id="p153" href="#p153" data-label="153" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*153</a>time of effecting the insurance, and which the plaintiff did not disclose.</p>

But it is submitted that this is a confounding of representation with a warranty. Representations are part of the proceedings preliminary to the contracts, and if false would not affect the policy unless they were material to the risk, that is, unless 'a knowledge of the truth would have induced the insurance company 'to decline the risk entirely, or charge a higher rate of premium.

Eor a knowledge of the facts concealed and misrepresented was material to the risk. The rate of premium charged by an insurance company is proportionate to the risk, and the extent of the risk depends not alone upon the occupation of the assured, nor upon the adjoiners and exposures, but as well upon the amount of interest the assured has in the property, and the inducements he may have to preserve his property or to destroy it, to be careful or criminal. One who is heavily in debt, and has unproductive property largely insured, might find the insurance-money much more desirable than his locked-up dead capital. Neither the law nor the principles of insurance offer any encou* agement for fraud.

    <p id="b155-6" data-blocks='[["BL_155.5",155,[129,878,1166,1118]]]'>III. There is another reason why the court below erred in entering judgment for the plaintiff. It was. proved by the deputy sheriff, and by Execution No. 174, July Term 1860, that a levy was made on the household furniture, bar fixtures, and liquors at the Belvidere Hotel, on June 19th 1860, the day before application was made for insurance upon those very articles, and more than a month before the policy was issued. This fact was not disclosed to the company. Was not its concealment a violation of the 2d condition of insurance, which provides, “if any person in obtaining insurance on his, her, or their goods, shall neglect to disclose the nature and amount of all encumbrances, if any exist thereon, whether of bond, judgment, mortgage, or liens of every other description, such insurance shall be void and of no effect” ? A levy made was certainly a lien upon the property, and a neglect to disclose the fact was a violation of the contract, and rendered it absolutely void by its express conditions. Whether or not the sheriff’s levy made insurance so desirable and so promptly sought for, it was obligatory upon the assured to inform the company of the truth. There were other executions and levies after the policy was issued, and which would come under the decision of this court in The Commonwealth Ins. Co. v. Berger &amp; Bro., Leg. Int. Dec. 19th 1862. (See 6 Wr. 285.) The 6th condition in the policy applies to such cases. But the point we now raise is different. Here was a misrepresentation and a warranty, which, not being complied with, rendered the policy void ad <em>initio.</em>

What is meant by this stipulation about <em>“consent” </em>to encumbrances and levies is explained in the 5th clause of conditions, which requires the assured to give immediate notice of all encumbrances to the company; to pay such additional premium as they shall determine, and obtain their written consent to the continuation of the policy. If property, either real or personal, is unencumbered when insured, but becomes encumbered, or is taken in execution during the life of the policy, the premium is deemed inadequate, and the company must have the opportunity of charging an additional premium, and therefore the stipulation for notice of such encumbrance or levy is a substantive and material part of the contract. It does not involve a question for the jury as to an increase of risk. The policy assumes that the risk is increased, and hence the necessity for an increase of premium. And this assumption, on which the contract is based, is justified by all experience; for encumbrances diminish the interest of the assured in the property, and levies disturb his possession, and both of these things increase the risk. The company takes insurance at less than the value of the property, that the owner may have an interest in protecting and preserving it —may be, in effect, part insurer. But when, through liens or levies, the owner’s interest is extinguished or diminished, the company loses the benefit of this joint insurance, and must be compensated therefor by another premium.</p>

Then it was shown in evidence that, on the 19th of June 1860, the sheriff had levied two executions, amounting together to near three hundred dollars, on the personal property at the Belvidere, and on the 28th of July 1860, another execution, amount not stated, was levied on the* same goods, and that these levies were undisposed of when the fire occurred on the night of the 28th of September 1860. It was shown also that in her application Mrs. Gottsman -had stated the encumbrances .on her real estate to be $3000 on ten acres of ground, worth $10,000, but that they amounted in. fact to $8173, and that the realty sold for $5705.75.</p>
    <p id="b157-6" data-blocks='[["BL_157.5",157,[115,2349,1172,91]],["BL_158.1",158,[301,417,1165,729]]]'>Upon this evidence the company insisted that Mrs. Gottsman had been guilty of a breach of warranty in misrepresenting the <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>liens on the real estate, and the court got entangled in nice distinctions betwen warranties and representations. Wherefore ? What had misrepresentations about real estate to do with this insurance on tavern furniture ? It is true, the barn or stable was included in the policy, but we do not learn that it was burned, and from the amount of the verdict, we presume it was not. Nor do we know that it was situated upon the ten acres of land of which Mrs. Gottsman spoke in answer to the interrogatory. The house was not included in this policy, but is said to have been insured in another company. The executions were liens on the goods insured, but the liens alluded to in the answers to interrogatories were not, for these were judgments merely on other secui’ities, which constituted only liens on the realty. If the interrogatory was broad enough to include the liens of the executions, the answer most manifestly had reference to real estate, and therefore was irrelevant to a policy on personal goods, and consequently irrelevant to the issue on trial.</p>
    <p id="b158-3" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[301,1145,1162,215]]]'>If this conclusion be not correct on account of .the barn being included in the policy, then we have no difficulty in saying that under all the terms of the policy, that answer was evidently a warranty, and the learned judge was in error in treating it merely as a representation.</p>
    <p id="b158-4" data-blocks='[["BL_158.5",158,[299,1359,1163,591]]]'>The better opinion, however, is that the sixth point presented the very issue upon the record, and ought to have been affirmed. Two executions levied before the policy took effect, and one afterwards — all of which liens lasted until the fire occurred — so affected Mrs. Gottsman’s interest in the goods that she was bound by the very terms of the contract to give notice of them to the company. Failing to do so, she forfeited her policy. The ground of forfeiture is the contract, not the opinion of a jury about increase of risk. The contract which works the forfeiture, assumed, itself, that such levies would increase the risk, and hence the provision for notice and more, premium. The suit is upon that contract, and if it is forfeit, the suit falls with it. It cannot be enforced in behalf of a party who violated a fundamental •condition.</p>
    <p id="b158-5" data-blocks='[["BL_158.6",158,[298,1959,1162,214]]]'>The assignment of errors is so badly expressed that there is ■some ground to doubt whether it covers this answer of the court to the sixth point; but as there was manifest error, both in the answer to this point and in ruling .against the warranty, we deem it our duty to reverse the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b158-6" data-blocks='[["BL_158.7",158,[303,2172,1161,260]],["BL_159.1",159,[114,410,1163,296]]]'>It may be said, in excuse of Mrs. Gottsman’s failure to give notice of the levies, that .she probably depended on the tenant, who was her son-in-law; but this, while it may acquit her memory of a suspicion of bad faith, cannot alter the legal effect of her contract. If she was deceived, imposed upon, or overreached in being got into such a contract, that would be legitimate ground <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>of defence. Ignorant people do no doubt often take policies of insurance without reading or understanding the multitudinous conditions with which they abound; but where, as here, the only question is whether the contract shall be administered as it is expressed, we must give due effect to every part of it, and not allow a party to appropriate its benefits who has disregarded its conditions.</p>
    <p id="b159-5" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[291,713,986,79]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>is awarded.</p>
