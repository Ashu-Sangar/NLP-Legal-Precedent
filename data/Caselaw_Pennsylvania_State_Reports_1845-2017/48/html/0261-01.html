On the 1st of May 1861, they were handed by House &amp; Co. to the Farmers’ Deposit Bank for collection. Owing, as was stated by the cashier of that bank, to the difficulties and dangers of remittance, they declined taking the risk of collection, and returned them to House &amp; Co., May 21st 1861, by whom they were immediately transmitted to Burbridge &amp; Co., their agents at New Orleans. On the 28th of June 1861, a protest of the first draft for nonacceptance was received by House &amp; Co., and notice of the same was mailed on the same day to A. King and Adams &amp; Co., both of whom had their places of business in the city of Pittsburgh.

Either on the afternoon of that day or on the day succeeding, notice of non-payment was given to King, one of the drawers of the draft, who at the time proposed to leave the question of his liability to an arbitration. About the time of the transmission of the drafts the mail facilities between Pittsburgh and New Orleans had been greatly interfered with, and immediately afterward the transmission of letters to Louisiana was prohibited by government, and the intercourse ■was not resumed until the latter part of June 1862, and the earliest receipt of letters at this place by the sea route was on the 1st of July 1862. But at that time no systematic intercourse with New Orleans by mail had been promulgated by the government, although at that time the mails were received at intervals.

It does not matter whether this notice was of the non-acceptance or non-payment; in either case it was had, both as to manner and time. If it was notice of non-acceptance, it was twenty-eight days after the protest; if it was of non-payment, it was seventeen days after protest. Whereas the postmaster swears that before the war they had received letters from New Orleans in four days; and the law requires the notice to be sent by the first mail after the protest: Story on Bills, § 288; Chitty on Bills 511, 513; 1 Pars, on Bills 509. The burden of proof is on the plaintiff. Mr. Chitty (on Bills 511) says: “ The holder must prove distinctly and by positive evidence that due notice of dishonour was given. It cannot be left to inference or presumption.” And see note <em>o </em>on same page. By sending to New Orleans the exact facts could have been got at. The plaintiff did not do that,' but has left the whole thing to rest on inference and presumption. He must therefore fail.</p>

To excuse this it is said the postal intercourse between Pittsburgh and New Orleans was stopped. If this was so, it would be' no excuse. If there is no mail to send the notice by, the holder is bound to look out for some other practicable way of sending it; and if there is a practicable way of sending.it, he is bound to send the notice by that way: Story on Bills, §§ 286, 298, 383; Chitty on Bills 505, and note /; 1 Pars, on Bills 484-5-6 and 7, and note <em>o. </em>The means of sending notice outside of the mails was ample and well known. One' witness proved that long after these protests he got a bill from New Orleans and another from Mobile, with the protests and notices, through Adams’s Express.

The plaintiffs’ agent at New Orleans was bound by law to mail, at New Orleans on the next day, the 2d, a notice of the protest to the drawer and endorsers at Pittsburgh, if there was a mail from New Orleans on that day. There was none mailed on that day. The omission could only be excused by direct and positive proof that there was no mail on that day, and the burden of producing that proof-was on the plaintiffs. They have produced no such proofs, and therefore they cannot recover. It seems from the testimony that the department made an order <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>on the 27th of May, to suspend the mails in Louisiana on the 31st of May, and that notice of that order was received in Pittsburgh on the 1st of June; hut there is no evidence as to when it was received in New Orleans, if ever, or as to when the mails stopped there. Besides, a letter was received by mail, dated at New Orleans, on the 1st of June, and the plaintiffs on the 28th of June got by mail the notice of the 31st of May, or of the 11th of June, which facts make it highly probable, if not certain, that there were mails from New Orleans after the 1st of June.</p>

There is no proof that the notice was sent by the first mail from New Orleans in 1862. The first mail from New Orleans was received about the 1st of July. The plaintiffs received the notice from their agent on the 14th of July, two weeks after. This is inexcusable laches, and must preclude the plaintiffs from recovery.</p>

He says Heazleton did not pay them; hut he says that when the plaintiffs got them from Heazleton they were credited on his account, and when they were given hack to him they were charged on his account; that the books have never been changed since; that Heazleton is a regular customer of the plaintiffs, buys large amounts of goods from them, and makes weekly payments on the account.

J., this was relied upon as a defence to the action, but the plaintiff proved that from the particular situation of the country, Leghorn being then occupied by the enemy, or in some such critical situation, though the bill was sent out by the plaintiff for the purpose of being presented, it was impossible to present it in due time, and it was presented as early as could be afterwards, and there was a verdict for the plaintiff. This was affirmed by the Court of King’s Bench, on a motion for a new trial by Mr. Erskine, on a technical ground not disputing the ruling at Nisi Prius, where Lord Ellenborough said, “ it was left to the jury to say whether, from the situation of the country, it was possible for the plaintiff to present it in due time.”</p>

It was drawn after the commencement of hostilities in Virginia, and before it was protested all intercourse between the two countries was interdicted. Under these circumstances notice is not to be expected, and ought not to be required. I at first doubted whether a bill which for a length of time is held under circumstances which dispense with notice, does not lose its commercial character, and become an ordinary debt. But on reflection, I am satisfied that this idea cannot be sustained, and that to charge the drawer, notice of the dishonour of his bill ought to be given within a reasonable time after the removal of the impediment.”</p>

On the 20th December 1860, South Carolina passed a secession ordinance, which example was followed by Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and on the 26th January 1861, by Louisiana, whose state authorities immediately seized the United States Branch Mint, and the Custom-House at New Orleans, with the government funds, amounting to more than $500,000, and the United States revenue cutter Robert McClelland was traitorously surrendered by Captain BresKwoód to the state of Louisiana. On the 1st of February Texas seceded, and on the 9th of same month the rebel congress at Montgomery elected Jefferson Davis President of the Confederate States of America, and on the 11th March the Constitution of the Confederate States was unanimously adopted. On the 12th April Fort Sumter- was bombarded, and on the 14th capitulated, and on the 21st May the rebel congress adjourned to meet at Richmond on the ,20th July, where their meetings have since been held.</p>

On the 3d May a proclamation was issued, calling for three years’ volunteers, and increasing the regular army and navy, and on the 10th May martial law was declared on certain islands on the coast of Florida. On the 26th of August the president, in pursuance of the Act of Congress of 13th July 1861, declared the inhabitants of these states in a state of insurrection against the United States, and that all commercial intercourse between the same and the inhabitants thereof and the citizens of other states and other parts of the United States is unlawful, and will remain unlawful until such insurrection shall cease, or have been suppressed. On the 12th May 1861, the president, by his proclamation, declared that the blockade of the ports of Beaufort, Port Royal, and New Orleans should so far cease and determine from and after the first day of June next, that commercial intercourse <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>with these ports, except as to persons, things, and information contraband of war, may from that time be carried on subject to the laws of the United States, and to the limitations and in pursuance of the regulations prescribed by the secretary of the treasary, in his order appended to the proclamation. On the 1st July 1862, in pursuance of the second section of an Act of Congress of 7th June 1862, the president, by his proclamation, declared that certain states, including Louisiana, were then in insurrection and rebellion, and the civil authority of the United States so obstructed that the provisions of the Act of 6th August 1861 could not be peaceably executed; that the taxes upon real estate under the act aforesaid, within said states, with a penalty of fifty per centum of said taxes, should be a lien upon the same till paid.</p>

In the report of the postmaster-general of the 2d December 1861 (Message and Documents 1861-2, part 3) p. 658), he says, “In consequence of the defection of the insurrectionary states, and the termination of the mail service in those states, on the 31st of May last, under the Act of Congress, approved February 28th 1861 (with the exception of service in Western Virginia), it becomes necessary to present the transportation statistics in two divisions; these are shown in Tables A. and B., attached to the report.” Table B., at page 602, is headed “ Table of mail service in the following states” (including Louisiana), “ms it stood on the 31st May 1861, discontinued under Act of Congress, approved February 28th 1861.”</p>

They were then immediately transmitted by the plaintiffs to Burbridge &amp; Co., their agents at New Orleans.</p>
    <p id="b269-8" data-blocks='[["BL_269.6",269,[185,1991,1164,423]]]'>It also appeared by the evidence of the postmaster at Pittsburgh, that all postal service in Louisiana, and other named places, was suspended on and after 31st May 1861. On the 26th May Í862, the first mail went out to New Orleans carrying ten thousand letters, including the letters which had accumulated in the dead-letter office. This mail was carried by the steamer Blaekstone; since then the regular route to New Orleans has been by New York. This cause was tried on the 9th December 1862, and the testimony, of course, is to be ta.ken as delivered at that time.</p>

    <p id="b270-6" data-blocks='[["BL_270.4",270,[286,584,1162,559]]]'>The omission of due and regular notice of the dishonour of these bills is therefore satisfactorily accounted for by the entire cessation of all mails and commercial intercourse with New Orleans, a blockaded port, and the only question is, whether such notice was given within a reasonable time after the removal of the impediment. It will be recollected that the only communication between Pittsburgh and New Orleans was by sea through the port of New York, and that the very first mail received was about the 1st of July. Under these circumstances particularly, as connected with the unsettled state of affairs at New Orleans, although in our possession, we cannot say the notice received at Pittsburgh on the 14th July, was not within a reasonable time after the removal of the impediment.</p>
