At the time of the alleged agreement to make the amicable partition, all of the three hundred and fifty acres were in possession and occupancy of the widow Mary M. Bradish and George L. Bra-dish. The plaintiffs lived in California since the year 1850, and continued to reside there until about the time of the commencement of this suit. The defendants, in support of their allegation of an amicable partition, gave in evidence a deed for the hundred <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>acres in controversy, from the defendants Charles Carey and Harriet E.

This deed was objected to by the plaintiffs, on the ground that the plaintiff William McConnell had not joined his wife in the execution, and because there was no such certificate of acknowledgment as is required in the case of <em>femes covert. </em>The court rejected it as a deed, but admitted it for the purpose of showing her assent to the alleged amicable partition.</p>

      <em>“ </em>The real and only question presented in this case is, whether the family arrangement made in 1856 or 185T, by the heirs of Samuel Bradish, deceased, by which the defendants, or their grantor,'- George L. Bradish, had set apart to him, as his equal share of his father’s-estate, the land in dispute, was valid as an amicable partition, and binding.on the plaintiffs? George L. Bradish, by inheritance and purchase, was the owner of two shares in the estate, and as such had the right to sue out his writ of partition, and have his portion set off. If the other heirs were undesirous of having any further subdivision of the estate made, and it was susceptible of such an one as would allow the interest owned by George to be set off as a separate purpart without prejudice to the whole, he had a right, and could have forced just such a partition of it between him and the other heirs who had a right to remain tenants in common, if they desired. [Instead of this he sought an amicable division, and, as he supposed, obtained it. He took pains enough, and worked more than a year to accomplish it. After having accomplished it, he went into the exclusive possession of his portion, surrendering that of all other parts of the estate, and paid the owelty charged by the arrangement on his share, and in good faith made valuable improvements. It thus becomes an executed partition, whether in parol or by deed.] Such amicable adjustments among tenants in common, by inheritance, have always been favoured and sustained by the courts when it was possible, whenever they were equable and just, and free from fraud. In England, as well as in this country, both before and since the passage of the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries in both countries, executed'parol partitions of this kind have been held valid. Was this one binding on the plaintiff, Mrs. McConnell ? [It is not charged that it was not equitable and just; nor that it was not fully executed on the part of George.] The only remaining question is, did the plaintiff so join or acquiesce in it as to be bound thereby ? She was a <em>feme covert, </em>and in California at the time; was written to, and by letter consented to it; and when the deed or release of her interest was sent to her for execution, she cheerfully, and with much pains, executed and acknowledged it in a manner that she and all the parties supposed sufficient at the time.</p>

Bradish should be allotted to him in severalty, we find it impossible to affirm the judgment of the court belotv, in view of the facts as they appeared in evidence. The case was put to the jury as depending upon an alleged parol partition, consummated against Mrs. McConnell by her consent. Hence her deed <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>without the joinder of her husband, and without a separate acknowledgment, was admitted as evidence of her assent, and the jury were left to find that if her willingness was expressed that George should have the portion of their father’s estate which he took into his exclusive possession, she could not recover her undivided interest in it, and that although he never complied with the conditions upon which her assent was ma'de. The evidence adduced at the trial did not warrant such a submission of the case to the jury. It is true that family arrangements are regarded with favour, and a parol partition among heirs, if fairly made, is binding even upon <em>femes covert, </em>if they are parties to it and assent to the arrangement. But it is binding only when the partition has been agreed to by all of the joint owners, and when it has been executed. Partition is a contract executed not in part but in whole. It need not indeed be of all the lands which the parties hold in common or jointly, but it must be complete so far as relates to the part set out in severalty. In this case there seems not only to have been no parol partition made, but none seems to have been intended. The transaction appears to have been rather an attempt of George S. Bradish to purchase the interests of his co-heirs in the one hundred acres of land now in controversy, and to obtain their title by deed from them. True, a part of the consideration which he agreed to pay was a release of his interest in the other lands descended from his father; but by his contract he was not bound to give the release until all the other heirs assured to him the tract which he sought to obtain in severalty. And this assurance, it was plainly contemplated, should be by deed. To the original contract only his mother and two of his co-heirs were parties. From the testimony of Mrs. Bradish, she and they seem to have conveyed by deed. Subsequently others of the heirs conveyed their interests, but Mrs. McConnell never did by any-legal assurance, and two of the other heirs at least never did at all. George L. Bradish was therefore under no obligation to give the release stipulated for, and he never gave it. To call this a parol partition, and to hold it executed as against those who never conveyed their interests, is therefore a mistake; and this is the error which ran through the charge and the rulings in the court below. It is not necessary to notice the assignments of error in detail. The observations we have made sufficiently express our opinion of them all.</p>
