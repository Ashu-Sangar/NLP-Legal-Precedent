As the whole question was one of title, and whether it was in the plaintiffs or defendant, it was really tried on the plea of property, although the plaintiffs began by showing a .taking by the defendant, but as on the plea of property the burthen, of proof was thrown on the plaintiffs, they should havfe proceeded with their proof, which would have consisted of the two bills of sale, which would then have been evidence, and made a <em>primé facie </em>case. Instead of this they permitted the defendant to go on with his case, which showed clearly that the possession of the vendors never was changed, and that no matter what paper title the plaintiffs had, it was fraudulent and void as to creditors of the vendors, of whom the defendant was one.</p>
