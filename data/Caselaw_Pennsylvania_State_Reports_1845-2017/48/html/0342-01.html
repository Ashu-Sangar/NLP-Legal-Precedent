The purchaser, as the judgments were anterior to the assignment, under advice of counsel, appropriated the purchase-money to six of the judgments, and took receipts of the plaintiffs therein, in the name of Smith, as assignee of McKibben, and paid to Smith himself the sum of $1512.48, which was the amount of the purchase-money applicable to two of them.</p>

If it were, the payment by Stewart to Smith the assignee, who was also the legal judgment-creditor of the assignor, would be held a payment sufficient to discharge, <em>pro tanto, </em>his liability for the purchase-money of the land. The contest now, however, is between Tarr, a creditor in equity of McKibben the assignor and Smith the assignee. The account is Smith’s account, though presented by his sureties, and it is upon Smith’s liabilities as assignee that we are now to adjudicate. When the assignment was made and accepted, it created a trust in the assignee for the benefit of the assignor’s creditors, of whom Tarr was one. It became a right of the assignor that Tarr rather than Smith should be paid the judgments of which he had become the owner, and whatever Smith received by virtue of the assignment, he necessarily held, stamped with the trust created by that instrument. Now, that Stewart holds his title to the land, bought by him, under the assignment, and that the money he paid for it was proceeds of the assignment, is perfectly plain. The assignee was accountable <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>for the whole value of the land. He could only discharge himself by showing that it was taken away from him by liens of creditors who had in law or in equity a right to the fund raised by the sale. It will hardly be pretended that if he had known that any one of the judgments prior to the assignment had boon paid by the assignor, and with, that knowledge had permitted the purchaser to pay it the second time out of the purchase-money, he could have claimed credit for such a second payment. In what better situation is he now ? As between him and his assignor, or him and Tarr, his <em>cestui que trust, </em>there has been no payment of the judgments assigned to Tarr. Even as judgment-creditor he has no right to hold the money which he has in hand, and certainly still less right, if possible, has he to hold it under the assignment. He took no beneficial interest under it. And if not, he is not entitled to a credit in his account for the two sums of $1355.28 and $157.20. The auditor and the court rightly disallowed it.</p>
