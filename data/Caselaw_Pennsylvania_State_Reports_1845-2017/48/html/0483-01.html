The street in front thereof was not paved. The plaintiff, following the custom in the city, went to the owners of the property fronting on the street, and obtained their signatures to a certain agreement dated January 8th 1858, that plaintiff should pave the street at a certain price. The work was not commenced by the plaintiff until October 1861. On December 2d 1859, the defendant sold and conveyed one of the lots in front of which the paving was afterwards done, to James A. Wright. The plaintiff filed a lien against the property, but sought to recover from defendant the amount of his bill.</p>

The defendant waited a period of two years for the performance of the contract, when he sold the property in front of which the work was alleged to have been done. Nothing can justify a delay -in the paving of a street for near four years. No cause was assigned by plaintiff, and the defendant was right in presuming an abandonment of the contract by the plaintiff.</p>

If the conveyance, two years after the contract, of itself, discharged the defendant from liability, then a sale by him, one day after the contract, would have the same effect. The result of which would be to make his liability dependent solely on the fact of ownership. Such was not the intention of the parties. The work was done on the credit of the individuals. The jury have found that the work was done within a reasonable time, and it was a question peculiarly within their province.</p>

Assuming the alleged conveyance to be <em>bond fide, </em>it was an advantage to the defendant in the sale of his property that the highway in front of it was under contract for paving, and thereby enhanced its value. Again, there was disadvantage to the plaintiff in defendant not informing him of the sale of the premises, but permitting him to go on with the work as if he were still the owner. There was at least a moral obligation on his part to save plaintiff from loss occasioned by his silence as to his having parted with the property. Any or all of these would be valid considerations.

The right of the plaintiff to compensation for his labour and materials was not contingent upon the continued ownership of the property abutting upon the paved street. It is doubtless a fair construction of the contract that the plaintiff, to entitle himself to the benefit of the promise of the defendant, was bound to do his work within a reasonable time. What was such a time was of course a question for the jury, and the defendant had a right to any evidence which tended to show that the plaintiff had unreasonably delayed commencing and finishing the work. But we are unable to perceive that the fact that the defendant had sold a portion of the property in front of which the pavement was to be laid, after his contract with the plaintiff, had any relevancy to the inquiry whether there had been default on the part of the plaintiff. Especially does such evidence appear to be irrelevant when we notice that it was offered without any proposal to show that the plaintiff knew of the sale, or knew that a sale was intended. Indeed, it is highly improbable that the rejected evidence was offered for any such purpose. Erom the course of the trial, as exhibited in the bill of exceptions, it seems rather to have been intended by it to shift the responsibility for the paving from the defendant to the lot in the hands of his vendee. But it was incompetent for any such purpose. The defendant assumed a personal liability. Col<a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>lateral to it may have been a lien on the lot, hnt the personal obligation could not be thrown off by his parting with the property collaterally held. He doubtless obtained a better price for it, because he had personally undertaken to pay for the pavement, by which it was to be improved. But, whatever may have been the purpose intended by the offer of the defendant’s deed, there is no aspect of the case in which we can perceive that it was admissible in evidence.</p>
