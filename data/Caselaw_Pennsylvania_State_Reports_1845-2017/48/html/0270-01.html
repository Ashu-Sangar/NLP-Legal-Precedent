The plaintiff in said suit obtained a rule on the defendants for judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence; whereupon the garnishees obtained leave of court to pay said amount into court, and on the same being paid in, the plaintiff Smitley obtained a rule on the attaching creditor, the present plaintiff, to show cause why he should not have leave to draw the same out; to this rule the present plaintiff filed his answer November 28th 1862, denying the jurisdiction of the Court of Common Pleas, and protesting against the decision of his rights by that court, while the District Court had obtained prior jurisdiction of the question; but the court made said rule absolute, and said Smitley drew said money out of court.</p>

Law Diet.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b272-8" data-blocks='[["BL_272.7",272,[306,1214,1160,432]]]'>“ Salary, in common parlance, is a recompense or consideration stipulated to be paid to a person for services; usually a fixed sum to be paid by the year. The distinction between fees and salary is too broad and well understood for us to suppose that the legislature intended to use these terms indiscriminately. If they had intended to exempt both fees and salaries, they might, and undoubtedly would, have used the term compensation, or some other word equivalent thereto, which would have included both. This they have not done, and we are bound to presume they used the appropriate term to express their intention.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b272-9" data-blocks='[["BL_272.8",272,[308,1644,1161,517]]]'>“ In construing an Act of Assembly, the language is to be be taken in its common and popular acceptation, unless technical words are employed, which must be understood according to their legal signification. There is a reason for the provision exempting salaries which does not apply to fees. The latter are payable on the performance of the specific service, and no credit is allowed, unless voluntarily given — the former at stated times, necessarily implying a credit for a longer or shorter period. In the case of a salary, an attachment might deprive the party of his means of living, which the legislature intended to provide against. But in the case of fees, being demandable as soon as the services are rendered, no such protection was necessary.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b272-10" data-blocks='[["BL_272.9",272,[312,2161,1157,216]]]'>“ Although the case stated does not present the question, we are of opinion that the attachment in execution only bound the indebtedness of the garnishees at the time of the service of the attachment, and not the indebtedness, subsequently incurred by the garnishee for fees for like services rendered thereafter.</p>

This cannot be&gt; considered as a debt within the contemplation of the Act of Assembly, and bound by the service of the attachment, as it was not then in existence.

      <em>Supplemental Opinion of the Court. </em>— “ Since the delivery of the foregoing opinion and the entry of judgment in this case, the counsel for the. plaintiff has called our attention to the case of Sheets <em>v. </em>Hobensack, 8 Harris 412, in which it was decided that moneys received by the garnishee in an attachment in execution, after the service thereof, are bound thereby. But for the authority of this case we should still adhere to our former opinion. But, considering ourselves bound by the decision of the Supreme Court, we are constrained to set aside our former judgment, and to direct judgment to be now entered for the full amount of the plaintiff’s claim, viz., $127.20, with costs of suit. And now, June 18th 1864, it is ordered, that the judgment entered in this case on the 4th instant be set aside, and that judgment be now entered for the sum of $127.20, with costs of suit.”</p>

By an Act of the 5th of April 1862, it is made the duty of the said inspector to gauge and mark all casks or barrels containing oil of any kind, whether crude or refined, manufactured, refined, sold, or offered for sale in said county, outside of the city of Pittsburgh, in the same manner and subject to the same regulations as now required by law in relation to gauging and marking casks containing domestic distilled spirits; for which service he shall be entitled to receive a fee of five cents per cask or barrel so gauged. It was also made his duty, on the first Monday of <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>July 1862, and quarterly thereafter, to report to the county controller of said county the quantity'of spirits inspected and the number of casks of oil and spirits gauged within said county, outside of said city, for the preceding quarter, together with a correct sworn statement of the fees received for the same; and to pay to the county treasurer, for the use of said county, one-third of all the fees so received by him; and any failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall be deemed a misdemeanor, and shall be punishable by fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or imprisonment in the county jail for a term not exceeding six months, or both. It is also made his duty to appoint from time to time such number of competent persons to act as deputy inspectors as may be required, and the persons so appointed shall take the same oath, and be liable to the same restrictions and penalties as the said inspector. The deputies are not to make the report as above required, nor is it intended to relieve the inspector from any of the duties and penalties above described.
