The property was to be sold at public sale, and the defendants agreed to pay for the property $85,000; but as there were other persons who bid upon the property the defendants were compelled to pay $95,400. By that .contract the plaintiffs covenanted to give to the defendants a good and sufficient deed in fee simple on the payment of the money into court. The defendants had the deed drawn and tendered for execution, and paid the money into court. When the plaintiffs executed the deed, they found the stamps would cost $180. They bought the stamps, and put them on the deed, and desired the defendants to pay for them. The defendants refused to do so, and this action brought to recover, the price of the stamps. Can the plaintiffs recover?”</p>

If it had been the former, it would have overridden the custom. But as it does not, we see no reason to refuse full weight to such a usage. It is a reasonable custom. It saves all dispute as to the stylo, manner, and verbiage of the deed, whether it shall be written, or printed on parchment or paper, whether the searches shall be more or less minute. Eventually we know that all taxes and expenses attending the transfer of property fall on the seller. The purchaser, if he calculates closely, includes the expenses of obtaining the title, in his estimate of the price which he will give for the property. Judgment for plaintiffs, $180.”</p>

The agreement between the parties was made the 21st February 1868, and had it prescribed which of them should pay for the stamp, it would, of course, have been the law as to them, but it only provided that the vendees should cause the title to be examined,- “ and upon receiving a deed <em>properly executed by the parties of the first part,” </em>should pay the purchase-money, &amp;c. If, as the learned, judge below held, this was not an agreement that the vendor should pay for the stamp, it is apparent that the parties did not treat about the matter, and we must look for the rule of duty outside of the agreement.</p>

We may throw out of the case, therefore, as utterly unimportant, the fact that, in Philadelphia vendees have generally paid for the stamp of deeds since the Act of Congress took effect. The defendants would not be bound by a usage no older than that.</p>
    <p id="b465-6" data-blocks='[["BL_465.4",465,[176,607,1164,215]]]'>The only source, then, from which the duty can be 'deduced, is the Act of Congress itself, and from that it seems quite clear that it is the duty of the vendor to add the stamp to his deed, and of course to buy and pay for it, if the vendees have not expressly agreed to do it for him.</p>

And how can he affix or cancel it except he buy it ? How else can he escape the penalty ? How else make a deed that shall not be “invalid and of no effect” ? It is shown us that the revenue officers at Washington construe the act as imposing this duty on vendors, and we cannot see that the terms of the enactment will bear any other construction.</p>

The stamp was essential to qualify the plaintiff's to perform what they had undertaken, essential to give effect and validity to the deed they had agreed to make. When they bound themselves to convey a valid title to the premises, they undertook for everything that was indispensable to that end, except, indeed, the cost of conveyancing, which; by. virtue of the usage referred to, the vendees were bound to pay. But the conveyancer has no duty in respect of the stamp. He makes the searches and engrosses the deed, and for this service the vendees pay, unless otherwise expressly agreed; but he neither makes, signs, or issues the instrument, within the meaning of the Act of Congress. That which gives the instrument life and effect is the act of the grantor, in exe<a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>curing and acknowledging it according to <em>the </em>law of the land, and in that it enjoins <em>him </em>to affix and cancel the stamp, the law of the land binds him to pay for it.</p>
