    "head_matter": "Keen versus Hopkins.\nAmendment of verdict, when allowed.\n1. Great discretion in putting into form and amending verdicts in an inferior court is allowed in a court of error ; and if there are any elements from which it can fairly expound the verdict, and carry out its substantial finding, the power of amendment thus exercised will not be closely scrutinized.\n2. Thus, where in'an attachment execution the jury found a \u201c verdict for plaintiff \u00a7354.34,\u201d it was not assignable as error that the record was amended so that the verdict should be \u201c that the jury find for the plaintiff, and that at the time of the service of the writ in this case upon the garnishee there was a debt of \u00a7354.34 due by the garnishee to the defendant.\u201d\nError to tke District Court of Philadelphia.\nThis was an attachment execution, by John Hopkins against Mary Davis, in which James S. Keen was summoned as garnishee of the defendant.\nAfter answering the interrogatories which were filed, Mr. Keen pleaded nulla Iona, and on this plea the cause was tried November 30th 1864, when the jury returned the following: \u201cVerdict for plaintiff, $354.34.\u201d Keen thereupon moved for a new trial, and an arrest of judgment, which motions were disallowed.\nOn the 24th of December 1864, on motion of the plaintiff, the court amended the record of finding of the jury as follows:\u2014 \u201c The jury find for the plaintiff, and that at the time of the service of the writ in this case upon the garnishee, there was a debt of $354.34, due by the garnishee, James S. Keen, to the defendant, Mary Davis\u201d; which was the error assigned here for the garnishee.\nLucas Hirst, for plaintiff in error.\nJunhin, for defendant.\nJanuary 16th 1865,"
