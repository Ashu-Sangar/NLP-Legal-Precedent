        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nWoodward, J.\nSince the enlargement of the equity powers of the courts in Pennsylvania, by the. legislation of 1836 and 1840, have they jurisdiction to decree a sale of a mortgaged estate, at the instance of the mortgagee ?\nThe jurisdiction, if possessed, was conferred by the legislation above referred to. Under none of the constitutions of Pennsylvania, and under no Act of Assembly prior to 1836, is it pretended that the courts possessed any such power. The remedies upon mortgages before that date were twofold \u2014 first, the common law remedy of entry or ejectment by the mortgagee, whereby he gained the possession and took the profits of the estate, subject, however, to the equity of redemption in the mortgagor; and, secondly, the scire facias given by the old provincial Act of 1705, whereby the equity of redemption could be foreclosed, and the estate brought to sale, at any time after a year had elapsed from default in making the last payment secured by the mortgage.\nWhen the revisers prepared the Act of 1836, enlarging the equity powers of the courts, they took notice of the chancery jurisdiction in England over mortgages, and of the remedies existing in Pennsylvania, and they said, \u201cWe find no defects in our law upon this point, and have no occasion to borrow any of the powers of the English Chancery.\u201d What they reported, therefore, was not intended by them to confer the jurisdiction we are now asked to exercise. And it is a reasonable inference that the legislature, when they adopted, without change of language, the sections reported by the revisers, adopted them upon the same reasons for which they were reported.\nNor will this inference be weakened by attention to the terms in which the new equity powers were conferred. \u201c The Supreme Court and the several courts of Common Pleas shall have the jurisdiction and powers of a court of chancery, so far as relates \u2014to the control, removal, and discharge of trustees, and the appointment of trustees, and the settlement of their accounts\u2014 the care of trust moneys and property, and other moneys and property made liable to the control of said courts \u2014 the supervision and control of partnerships and corporations, other than municipal corporations \u2014 and all cases over which courts of chancery entertain jurisdiction on the grounds of fraud, accident, mistake, or account.\u201d\nOmitting several irrelevant provisions of the Acts of 1836 and 1840, I have assembled together, in the above extract, all of the provisions that can, by any reasonable construction, be thought to bear on the question before us. It will be observed, that mortgages are not mentioned or referred to in these provisions.\nBut control of trustees, of trust property, and of trustees\u2019 accounts is expressly conferred, and we are pointed to the fact that the mortgage before us creates several trusts, and styles the mortgagees trustees. Hence, it is inferred, we have jurisdiction over the subject-matter, and may decree a sale as an incident of that jurisdiction.\nThis would be undoubtedly correct, if the jurisdiction were invoked by creditors, or any parties standing in the relation of cestuis que trust. If the trustees were shown to be mismanaging the trust, or wasting the estate, they might be restrained or removed \u2014 they could' be compelled to account to their cestuis que trust and to the mortgagors, and the courts, having assumed jurisdiction on any of these grounds, would take all necessary care of the moneys and properties in their hands. So far our credentials would be clear, but the question still remains, whether we have power, before jurisdiction has attached on any of these grounds, to sell the mortgagor\u2019s estate at the instance of the mortgagees.\nNow, between mortgagor and mortgagee, as such, there is no trust. Mortgages have always been regarded in Pennsylvania, as they are in chancery in England, as mere securities for money, or for performance of collateral conditions. They establish the relation of debtor and creditor, rather than of trustee and cestui que trust. I have alluded already to the right of the mortgagee to proceed, in invitum, against the mortgagor, which can never take place between a trustee and cestui que trust. They have always an identity and unity of interest. In general, a trustee is not allowed to take away the possession from his cestui que trust, but a court of equity never interferes to prevent a mortgagee from assuming possession after breach of any condition. In this the contrast between the two characters is distinctly marked. See Sir Thomas Plumer\u2019S observations in Cholmondeley v. Clinton, 2 Jac. & Walk. 182-189.\nAnd if we look through the mortgage in this case, we shall see that, in accordance with the general principle, it establishes no other than the ordinary relation of mortgagor and mortgagee between the Montour Iron Company and the gentlemen named as trustees, and that the trusts raised are for the benefit of the bondholders.\nThe instrument is called a trust mortgage; is dated the 28th September 1855; recites the purpose of the Montour Iron Company to borrow $600,000, by an issue of twelve hundred bonds, each for the sum of five hundred dollars, and for the purpose of securing the payment of principal and interest of these bonds the managers recite their authority to execute a mortgage on the whole real estate, machinery, and fixtures belonging to said company. It then proceeds to convey to the three designated trustees, the plaintiffs on this record, all the estates of the company, and then comes the declaration of the trusts as follow: \u2014 \u25a0\n1st. To permit the company to retain the possession and use of the mortgaged premises. This is no more than a simple declaration of the ordinary legal effect of such instruments. Mortgagors do of right retain possession, until breach of some condition. From the time of James I. it was usual to insert such a clause in the English mortgage, but if there be no such express agreement in the deed, it is the general understanding of the parties, and their tacit consent is presumed: 4 Kent\u2019s Com. 159.\n2d. The second trust is, that whenever it shall become the duty of the trustees to enter and take possession, they shall issue process for the sale of the premises, or proceed to sell them without process, after giving the notice prescribed. This is a trust for the benefit of the purchasers of the bonds, and there is nothing in it that impairs or qualifies the mortgage character of the instrument. \u201cIt is usual,\u201d says Chancellor Kent, 4 Com. 146, \u201c to add to the mortgage a power of sale, in case of default, which enables the mortgagee to obtain relief in a prompt and easy manner, without the expense, trouble, formality, and delay of foreclosure by a bill in equity.\u201d\nThe 3d trust is to pay the proceeds of sale to the bond-holders, after deducting expenses, and to pay over any residue to the Montour Iron Company. This, again, is no more than what is the duty of every mortgagee in possession; for, after exercising the power of sale, he is bound to account to the mortgagor. It is one of those cases over which courts of chancery entertain jurisdiction under the head of account, and is clearly within our Act of 1836. In a proper case, and at the suit of the mortgagor, we should not hesitate to exercise the jurisdiction.\nSuch are the trusts declared. The instrument then proceeds to express the covenants between the immediate parties. The company covenants\u2014\n1st. For conveyance to the trustees of any subsequently acquired real estate.\n2d. For the payment to the trustees of the annual sum of twenty-eight thousand dollars, as a sinking fund for the redemption of the bonds.\n3d. For maintaining an insurance upon their buildings.\n4th. For the punctual payment to holders of the bonds, or of the interest warrants thereto annexed, the interest thereon as the same shall become due, and the principal when it shall fall due.\n5th. In case of failure to make the stipulated payments, on account either of the sinking fund, or of the interest or principal of the mortgage debt, the trustees may, at the instance of holders of bonds to the amount of $10,000, give the company written notice that they have broken their covenants, and that the whole debt, principal and interest, will, after thirty days, be taken and considered to have become due one year before the date of the notice, and after sixty days from the date of such notice a scire facias may be immediately issued.\n6 th. When the company has made default in any of the payments stipulated for, jt is made the duty of the trustees, at their option, either to issue scire facias, and proceed to sell the premises by due course of law, or to sell the same, as before provided, without legal process, by auction, after notice in Philadelphia and New York newspapers.\nThen follow several other unimportant stipulations, and the usual defeasance clause of mortgages.\nFrom this analysis of the document, it is apparent, that whilst the relation of trustee and cestui que trust is established and accurately defined between the trustees and the purchasers of the bonds, the relation between the trustees and the Montour Company is that of mortgagor and mortgagee simply. This latter relation is, indeed, attended with some stipulations that are unusual in the ordinary Pennsylvania mortgage, but which are not unknown to the law of mortgages, and which are very necessary where, as in this instance, a marketable security was to be created as the means of borrowing money. This class of instruments, quite unknown to the framers of our old Act of 1705, have become very common in our day. They are tripartite in substance and effect. Besides the two contracting parties, there are the creditors, unascertained, indeed, when the instrument is made, but well known as a party when the remedies come to be discussed. Between them and their trustees it is nothing but a trust \u2014 between the trustees and the mortgagor it is nothing but a mortgage. And if the creditors be regarded as the substantial plaintiffs on this record, then, as between them and the mortgagor, the instrument can be regarded as nothing else than a mortgage. Acting through their trustees, they have all the remedies they have stipulated for, and all which the law has provided for mortgage-creditors against mortgage-debtors, but they have not, either on their own account, or in behalf of their trustees, the right to come into chancery for a decree of sale. The reason is, that power to decree a sale in equity against the mortgagor has not as yet been given to the courts.\nI said they have all the remedies stipulated for. A mortgage is a contract. And contracts are to be construed and administered, as near as may be, according to the intentions of the parties. The lawful provisions of the contract are law to the parties. When these parties contracted, they contemplated the possibility of default of payment, and provided for it. They said the trustees should redress any such breach, by assuming the possession of the premises for the benefit of the creditors, or by proceeding by seire facias to bring them to a judicial sale, or by selling the premises themselves, after certain stipulated notice. These were the modes in which they agreed breach of the conditions of this contract should be redressed. Did they dream of any other ? A\u00f1d especially of that undefined and equivocal power which is now invoked ? No word they used implies that they did, but the trifold remedy provided excludes such an implication.\nOrdinarily, we do not encourage parties to come into courts of equity, whilst they have ample remedies outside. It would be strange if we should strain the grant of our chancery powers, to embrace a case so well furnished with other remedies.\nThe obscure clause of the Act of 1836, which speaks of moneys and properties made subject to courts of chancery, may have intended to confer full powers over such moneys and properties where jurisdiction had attached under any of the ordinary heads of account, injunction, &c., but could not have been framed to confer a new and extraordinary power, such as is invoked here. Nor do those portions of the act which relate to the control of corporations, and to cases of fraud, accident, mistake, or account, apply to this question. The present bill, indeed, does not make a case under either of these heads of equity.\nIt was suggested, that the trustees had a right to exercise their powers under the eye and with the approbation of this court, and of course to obtain, beforehand, our sanction to the title they proposed to convey. If jurisdiction over their accounts belonged to us, there might be some ground for this suggestion; but under the 15th section of the Act of 14th June 1836, that jurisdiction is vested in the Common Pleas, and if the plaintiffs wanted judicial advice, they should have gone there for it.\nA sale under our authority, we having no jurisdiction to decree it, would do the title more harm than good. The trustees have full power given them to convey in fee simple discharged of all trusts, and there ought to be no question about whatever title they grant in pursuance of the terms expressed in the mortgage.\nThe objection that this ease was ruled at Nisi Prius is groundless. If the Supreme Court had jurisdiction, it was exercisable by the judge at Nisi Prius.\nThere are some other points on the record, but it is not necessary to notice them, as our want of jurisdiction is fatal to the whole proceeding.\nThis ruling is not to be considered inconsistent with those decrees we have made for the sale of mortgaged premises on creditors\u2019 bills. This is the first case we have had of mortgagee and mortgagor. We hold that our equity powers do not embrace that relation.\nThe decree is reversed.",

    "head_matter": "Ashhurst et al. versus The Montour Iron Company.\nThe courts of Pennsylvania have no jurisdiction, in equity, to decree a sale of mortgaged premises, at the instance of the mortgagee; although the mortgagor may be a corporation, and the mortgage given in trust to secure its bonds.\nThey might acquire jurisdiction in a suit by the oesiuis giie trust against the mortgagees, and having thus assumed jurisdiction of the subject-matter, proceed to decree a sale for the benefit of the bond-holders; but they cannot do so, at the suit of the mortgagees against the mortgagor.'\nIt seems, that trustees may apply to the court having jurisdiction of their accounts, for its assistance and protection in the administration of the trust.\nAppeal in Equity from the Court of Nisi Prius.\nThis was a bill in equity exhibited by John Ashhurst and Edwin M. Lewis, who survived Isaac R. Davis,.against The Mon-tour Iron Company, for the foreclosure of a mortgage executed to the complainants upon all the property of the Company, in trust for the bond-holders thereof. The mortgage was as follows:\u2014\n\u201c An indenture made this twenty-eighth day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-five (1855), between The Montour Iron Company of the one part, and Isaac R. Davis, John Ashhurst and Edwin M. Lewis, of the city of Philadelphia, of the other part. Whereas, The MonfourTron Company, for the purpose of raising the sum of six hundred thousand dollars, in order to enable them to pay existing debts, and to furnish the necessary capital to carry on their business, have determined, at a meeting of the stockholders, duly convened and held on the twenty-sixth day of September, Anno Domini 1855, to issue the bonds of the company for the said sum of $600,000,-bearing an interest of six per cent, per annum, payable half-yearly on the first days of January and July; and have authorized the managers of the said company to borrow the said sum, and' issue twelve hundred bonds, numbered from 1 to 1200 inclusive, each bond being given for the sum of $500, in the following form, viz.: \u2014 \u201d [Here followed a form of bond.]\n\u201c And have also authorized and directed the said managers of the said company, in order to secure the payment of said principal and interest, to make, execute, seal, and deliver, in the name and under the corporate seal of the said company, to the said trustees, and the survivors and survivor of them, and the heirs, executors, administrators and assigns of such survivor, a mortgage on the whole of the real estate, machinery, and fixtures belonging to the said company, whatsoever' and wheresoever the same may be; to be held by them, and the survivors and survivor of them, and the heirs, executors, administrators and assigns of such survivor, in trust for the purposes and subject to the conditions and provisions herein contained.\n\u201cNow, therefore, this Indenture witnesseth, that the said The Montour Iron Company, for and in consideration, as well of the premises, and for the better securing the payment of the said loan, principal and interest, unto the holders of the bonds issued under the provisions hereof, as of the further sum of five dollars, unto the said The Montour Iron Company, well and truly paid by the said Isaac R. Davis, John Ashhurst, and Edwin M. Lewis, at and before the sealing and delivery hereof, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged, have grafted, bargained, sold, aliened, enfeoffed, released, and confirmed, and by these presents do grant, bargain, sell, - alien, enfeoff, release, and confirm unto the said Isaac R.

In trust to permit and suffer the said Montour Iron Company to retain the free, absolute, and uncontrolled use and possession of the estate hereinbefore mentioned, described, and intended to be now or hereafter conveyed and mortgaged; and to use, occupy, manage, and control the same for the mining of ore, manufacture of iron, and for all or every other purpose whatever, as though this indenture had not been made, until by the provisions hereof, the trustees for the time being shall be required to enter and take possession thereof, under the provisions and for the purposes of this trust. .\n\u201c 2d. And upon this further trust, whenever, according to the provisions hereof, it shall become the duty of the trustees for the time being to enter upon and take possession of the premises herein described and conveyed or intended so to be, then immediately either to issue process upon this indenture of mortgage, and sell the property hereby mortgaged and conveyed by due course of law; or to enter upon and take possession thereof; or with or without entering upon and taking possession, to sell and dispose of the same in whole or in part, in such way, by public auction, after having given at least three months\u2019 public notice, to be published twice a week in two daily newspapers in the city of Philadelphia, and two daily newspapers in the city of New York, at any time or times, for any price or prices, on any terms, for cash or on credit, with any conditions or reservations of rents, or subject to any mortgages or securities for the purchase-moneys, or any part or parts thereof, as in the sole and absolute discretion of the trustees for the time being (for the exercise of which discretion the said trustees shall not be made in any way, nor by any person or persons, bodies politic or corporate, liable or responsible), shall appear best for the interest of the holders of the said bonds issued according to and intended to be secured by this indenture; and to make, execute, and deliver unto the purchaser or purchasers thereof, good and sufficient indentures or conveyances, vesting in him or them a full and absolute title in fee simple, or for any other lesser estate, in the premises thereby conveyed, freed and discharged from all trusts whatever, and without any obligation on the said purchaser or purchasers to see or to be responsible for the application or misapplication of the purchase-money, or for the propriety or expediency of the exercise of any power herein contained; in relation to which, the execution of indentures or conveyances by the trustees, shall be taken and considered, in all cases and before all tribunals, to be conclusive upon the parties hereto, as well as upon the holders of the bonds issued as aforesaid.\n\u201c 3d.

Davis, John Ashhurst, and Edwin M. Lewis, and the survivors and survivor of them, and the heirs, executors and administrators of such survivor, in manner following, that is to say:\n\u201c 1. That the said Montour Iron Company, and their successors, shall and will, at any time upon the demand of the trustees for the time being, or of a majority of them, from time to time, and at any time hereafter, grant, convey, assign, and set over unto the said trustees, and to the survivors or survivor of them, and the heirs, executors and administrators of such survivor, all real estate, and all the buildings, improvements, machinery, fixtures, in or upon such real estate which the said company shall hereafter in any way acquire or become seised or possessed of, or which may be held by third persons for their use, and subject to their conveyance or control; and shall and will also make, do, seal, execute, deliver, and acknowledge, or cause to be made, done, executed, delivered, and acknowledged, all and every such further and other acts, matters, things, deeds, conveyances, and assurances in the law, for the better assuring, conveying, and confirming unto the said trustees for the time being, and the survivors and survivor of them, and the heirs, executors and administrators of such survivor and assigns, all and singular the hereditaments and premises, estate and property of every kind and description, hereby conveyed or intended so to be, or which are by these presents agreed and covenanted to be hereafter conveyed to the said trustees as aforesaid, as by the said trustees for the time being, or a majority of them, may, or his or their counsel learned in the law, shall be reasonably desired or required, for the better effectuating and carrying put the provisions, objects, and purposes of this mortgage, and securing the payment of the principal and interest of the bonds to be issued as aforesaid: All which estates shall be held by the said trustees for the time being, in, under, and upon the several and respective trusts, and for the uses and purposes, and subject to the powers and authorities herein mentioned, declared, given, and expressed.\n\u201c2. That the said Montour Iron Company shall and will pay or cause to be paid into the hands of the said trustees for the time, being the annual sum of $28,000 in lawful money of the United States, which said sum shall he so paid in equal half-yearly payments of $14,000, on the first days of the months of April and October in each and every year, during the continuance of this trust (and until the bonds issued under the provisions hereof as aforesaid shall be fully and entirely paid and satisfied, with principal and interest), the first semi-annual payment to be made on the 1st day of April, A. D. 1856, and half-yearly thereafter as aforesaid: And the sums of money so paid unto the said trustees semi-annually, shall be held by them, and the survivors and survivor of them, and the heirs, executors and administrators of such survivor, in trust as and for a sinking fund, for the purpose of securing, discharging, and extinguishing the debt intended to be secured by this indenture of mortgage; and the same shall be applied, with any accumulation of interest, to the purchase of the bonds referred to in and secured by these presents, provided they can be obtained at or under par, at prices approved by the said trustees; and all the said bonds so purchased by the trustees shall be immediately endorsed by them as so purchased .and held for the said sinking fund, and not to be transferred or disposed of by them in any way whatever; of which said investment notice shall be given to the said company, and the said bonds so endorsed shall be retained by the said trustees, and the interest thereon shall be paid to them, until the final settlement of this whole trust: But if the trustees should not be able to purchase and obtain the said bonds, at prices considered satisfactory by them, then the said sinking fund, or so much thereof as shall not have been invested, with all its accumulation of interest, shall be invested in the loans of the state of Pennsylvania, until the said trustees in their discretion shall think proper to purchase the bonds of the said company secured by these presents as aforesaid, or until the bonds hereby secured shall become due and payable, either by lapse of time, or by the default of the said company, when the whole remainder of the said sinking fund, principal and interest, shall be paid over to the person or persons who may be or become the lawful holders of the said bonds, pro rata, until the same are fully paid and discharged; and any balance which may then still remain in the hands of the trustees for the time being, shall be paid over to the said Montour Iron Company, their successors or assigns, for their sole use and behoof.\n\u201c 3. That the said Montour Iron Company and their successors shall and will cause and procure the buildings, improvements, machinery, and other property hereby conveyed in mortgage, to be insured and kept insured during the continuance of this trust, against fire, for not less than $250,000, and the policy or policies of insurance shall be made out in the name of the said company, and the premiums shall be paid by them; but they (the said policies) shall contain a clause that the amount of any loss by fire shall be paid over to the said trustees, and shall be by them applied, at the option of the company, either to the restoration and rebuilding of the buildings and premises injured by the said fire, or be added to the sinking fund hereinbefore mentioned and directed in relation to the same.\n\u201c4. That the said Montour Iron Company shall and w'ill punctually pay to the holders of the said bonds, or of the interest warrants thereto attached, the interest thereon, semi-annually, as the same shall fall and become due, without any reduction for or on account of any taxes, charges, or assessments whatever, according to the terms and conditions in the said bonds contained, or according to the provisions of this indenture of mortgage; and shall and will, on the 1st day of July, A.

C. & J. Fallon, who were bond-holders to the amount of $>40,000, the complainants had given notice to The Montour Iron Company, that they had broken the covenants in the mortgage; and that according to its terms, the whole of the debt thereby secured, would, after thirty days, be taken and considered to have fallen and become due and payable one year before the date of such notice.\nThat more than thirty days had elapsed since the giving of such notice, and thereby the whole amount secured by the said mortgage became immediately due and payable. That the Mon-tour Iron Company had no funds to make the semi-annual payment to the complainants, as trustees, due on the 1st October 1857; that their profits were not more than sufficient to meet their ordinary expenses, and were wholly inadequate to pay the interest due upon their bonds; and that unless the mortgaged premises were sold, the security of the bond-holders would be greatly impaired, if not wholly lost and destroyed. They therefore prayed the court to decree a sale of the mortgaged premises, and that the proceeds might be divided and distributed among the bo\u00f1d-holders pro rata, in the manner set forth in the mortgage.\nThe court below, after hearing the case on bill, answer, and master\u2019s report, decreed a sale of the mortgaged premises as prayed for in the bill. And from this decree the defendants appealed.\nBullitt, for the appellants.\nGerhard, for the appellees."
