    "head_matter": "Hayes versus Gillespie.\nWhere a foreign attachment is levied on real estate, and the tenant in possession is summoned as garnishee, it must appear by the sheriff's return that the latter holds under the defendant in the attachment.\nWhere the defendant inherits the land subject to an estate by the curtesy, the tenant by the curtesy does not hold under him, and cannot be summoned as garnishee in a foreign attachment against such owner.\nError to the Common Pleas of Susquehanna county.\nThis was a foreign attachment in debt, by Thomas T. Hayes against William T. Gillespie, to which the sheriff returned that he had levied- the same upon certain lands of the defendant, and summoned John Gillespie, the tenant in possession, as garnishee.\nJudgment was entered by default, and the lands levied on were seized in execution and condemned. And afterwards, the court below, on motion of the defendant, set aside the judgment and all subsequent proceedings, on the ground that there had been no proper service of the attachment; whereupon the plaintiff removed the cause to this court, and here assigned the same for error.\nLittle Sp Post, for the plaintiff in error,\ncited Act 18th June 1836, \u00a7 49, Brightly\u2019s Purd. 389; 1 Cruise on Real Property, tit. 5, ch. 2, \u00a7\u00a7 18, 26, 29; Schwartz\u2019s Estate, 2 Harris 47.\nW. $ W. H. Jessup, for the defendant in error,\ncited Lambert v. Challis, 10 Leg. Int. 51 ; Repp\u2019s Case, 8 Rep. 35; Fitzherbert, N. B. 143; 2 Bac. Abr. 229; Crabb on Real Property, \u00a7\u00a7 1075, 1110; 1 Atk. 603.\nIn the case of Lambert v. Challis, in the District Court of Philadelphia, the following opinion was delivered by\nSharswood, P. J. \u2014 This is a foreign attachment levied on real estate. The court, under \\ 66 of the Act of 13th June 1836, having ordered a writ to issue to the sheriff to collect the rent of the premises, application is now made to vacate that order, on the ground, that the tenant in possession does not hold under the defendant in the attachment.\nIn providing for the proper mode of serving the writ, (S 49 requires the sheriff \u201c to leave a copy of the writ with the tenant, or other person in actual possession, holding under the defendant in the attachment, and to summon him as garnishee,\u201d Where there is no such person in possession, publication is required. It is evidently the duty of the sheriff to make return of the mode in which the writ has been served. In the return, in the case before us, the sheriff does not state that the tenant in possession holds under the defendant. It is only such a tenant that the act recognises as garnishee; the tenant spoken of in \u00a7 66, is evidently the tenant spoken of in \u00a7 49. The return to the writ, therefore, is defective, in not stating a material fact, and the proceeding irregular. ' Hule absolute.\nBrightly, in support of the rule. H. M. Phillips, conird."
