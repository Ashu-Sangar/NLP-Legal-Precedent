Campbell, 4 Casey 156, affirmed.\nError to the Common Pleas of Allegheny county.\nThis was a scire facias by Krug & Kohlman against Jacob Light-foot, on a mechanic\u2019s claim for $53.06, which was filed against a \u201cone-storied brick kitchen, or back building,\u201d erected on the easterly half of lot No. 40, in Bell, Edwards & Breed\u2019s plan of lots in the borough' of Birmingham, \u201cbeing twelve by fourteen feet square, and one story high.\u201d\nThe defendant filed the following affidavit of defence:\u2014\n\u201c Before me, personally came John Lightfoot, agent for Jacob Lightfoot, who for defence saith, that the alleged building, against which the mechanic\u2019s lien is filed, is not such a building as the act contemplated a lien would lie against; it being the mere addition to the main building of a kitchen; such main building being a two-storied brick house.\n\u201cJohn Lightroot.\u201d\nOn motion of the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel, the court below gave judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence,' which was here assigned for error.\nF. H. Collier, for the plaintiff in error,\ncited Landis\u2019s Appeal, 10 Barr 379; Miller v. Oliver, 8 Watts 514.\nR. B. Carnahan, for the defendant in error,\ncited and relied npon.the case of Nelson v. Campbell, 4 Casey 156.\nThis ease was argued at Pittsburgh, and decided at Philadelphia on the 3d January 1860. '"
