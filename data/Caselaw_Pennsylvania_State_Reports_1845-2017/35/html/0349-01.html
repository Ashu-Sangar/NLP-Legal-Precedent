Gilbert was the owner of a three story brick hotel, at the north-east corner of Front and Race streets, in the borough of Catasauqua, which was erected and completed in the year 1853; the house was 40 feet in front on Front street, and 60 feet in depth on Race street.</p>

The appellants filed their claim for $5228.58 for work and materials in and about the erection and construction of this building.</p>

From this decree, the present appeal was taken.</p>

This last case was, like this, a claim for building a kitchen to a house already erected, and the lien was sustained. We do not see that it makes any difference what curtilage is described for the house, in the claim filed, or whether there be any; for the law provides for the settlement of this, as part of the proceeding, according to the purposes of the building. The appellants are entitled to their lien; but the paper-book is so little in conformity to the rules of this court that we do not allow the appellants their costs. We do not even allow them interest; for we have no date given us of the sheriff’s sale, and cannot know to what date to calculate it.</p>
