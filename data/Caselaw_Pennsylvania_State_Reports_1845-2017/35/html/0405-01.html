The lien of the original judgment expired on the 30th November; and though the agreement to revive it was executed on the 24th of the same month, this would have no force to continue the lien, so that all right this revived judgment can now claim is of a lien commencing the 3d December 1855, irrespective of the earlier judgment.</p>

To understand the nature and effect of this restriction, it is only necessary to refer to the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Stanton <em>v. </em>White, 8 <em>Casey </em>369. The lien entered upon the bond would be so far restricted, but it did not exempt other real and personal property of the obligee from liability to execution after the debt became due.</p>

A judgment which could be entered upon the bond, would, by the contract of the parties, be restricted, <em>quoad </em>its lien, for the statutory life of that judgment, say five years, but all other property would be liable to execution upon default of payment within and after that time. The contract between the parties was a confession of judgment to secure the payment of the debts in three years, and during this time upon compliance by the obligor with his payments, the lien for security was restricted to certain property, and the liability of any other property, either real or personal, was withheld, because no execution could issue; but when there was a failure to pay the debt and it all became due, and the defendant, who had the privilege to pay the amount on encumbrances, by his new contract and amicable <em>scire facias, </em>admitted that he had not so done, and by his confession of judgment, without any restriction or qualification, a judgment with all the ordinary incidents, acknowledged that it was ripe for general execution, we cannot see upon what principle it can be claimed, that the first contract is to control and limit the lien to the restricted property referred to in the bond.</p>

If, however, we hold that the restricted lien had answered its contract purpose, by enabling the defendant to dispose of any other property he'may have desired to sell, during the continuance of the first judgment, as a new judgment, the revival ought to bind any property which the defendant owned at the time of such revival. In Ramsey <em>v. </em>Linn, 2 <em>Eawle </em>229, it is held, that an amicable revival of a judgment which had previously no legal existence, is a good judgment, and creates a valid lien; and in Cash <em>v. </em>Tozer, 1 <em>W. £ 8. 525, </em>where there was a defective judgment against two of three nominal defendants,, upon an amicable revival, signed by <em>all </em>of the defendants, the new judgment became a valid judgment against the property of all three.</p>

The amicable <em>soi. fa. </em>opens as it were the claim of the judgment, so as not only to continue any unexpired and early lien, but to give it all the incidents of a new judgment, unless by a new agreement of the parties it be newly limited or restricted. The new judgment is an absolute one, full and unlimited. What right has a defendant or his creditors now to look back beyond the present record, and attach to it disabilities which belonged to another judgment ? The lien under which the plaintiff now claims, originated with the new judgment, and has no reference, <em>quoad </em>the lien, to the old judgment, for that, restricted or unrestricted, was lost on the 30th November, three days before the entry of the new judgment.</p>

It is said, that a party who consents to take a judgment with a restricted lien may, on the principles of the ruling in this case, defeat his agreement by immediately reviving it and obtaining a general lien. A sufficient answer to this objection is, that here the defendant had the whole benefit of the restriction. The judgment was entered 30th November 1850, and was not revived until 3d December 1855. It had lost its lien even on the property to which it was restricted; and if the defendant had intended to restrict the legal operation of the new judgment, which was not a judgment <em>in invitum, </em>but by confession, he should have stipulated for it. The case supposed in argument is not this cáse, and it will be soon enough to consider it when it arises. Meantime, all that did arise in this case was well decided in the court below.</p>
