Time was not here of the essence of the contract: D’Arras <em>v. </em>Keyser, 2 <em>Casey </em>249. Yet the defendant showed diligence and activity on his part to comply with his contract, and, so far as he could, did comply, before the day. Within three weeks after the day, and before any repudiation or rescission, it was, as we contend, and as is agreed by all the heirs, fully performed. But if the court should be of a different opinion, then do we not come within the general scope of power vested in the courts to effectuate justice through the medium of conditional verdicts. The general principle is, that where there exists an equity which cannot be reached by the ordinary form of verdict, there a conditional verdict will be directed, no matter what the form of action, or whether it relate to real or personal estate: <a href="/watts/6/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Watts 213" data-case-ids="1846143" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0213-01">6 <em>Watts </em>213</a>; Hart <em>v. </em>Withers, 1 <em>Penn.

And it is submitted, that where, upon the trial of a cause, between the parties named on the record, it becomes apparent, that the rights of third parties not <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>named of record will be endangered, the court has full power to direct a conditional verdict, to be moulded in such form as will effectuate justice between all the interests involved. Such practice would certainly be conformable to equity.</p>

Should we give in to this practice, we should gradually change the system of our pleadings and proofs, encourage remissness in suitors, and produce an increased delay and litigation.”</p>

Very evidently, there was no inequitable delay in Townsend’s execution of the deed, but his wife had not yet signed it when the grantee died. Her signing it afterwards, and the recording of it, did not make a complete execution and delivery of the deed to the grantee. His death, therefore, prevented the performance of the contract in its stipulated form, and any delay that has since occurred, seems to have arisen from the supposition that the deed that had been made was valid in law. It is plain enough, that in such cases equity relieves the party from a strict performance, and allows it to be made out of time.</p>
    <p id="b127-9" data-blocks='[["BL_127.11",127,[117,1736,1160,471]]]'>The court below were right in rejecting this contract as a defence to the bond and mortgage sued upon, because it had not been performed by the defendant below, and did not, therefore, constitute a legal set-off, or payment of so much. But we think that the defendant had an equity, that entitled him to have a conditional verdict, so that the judgment might be moulded in such form, as to allow him to make a payment according to the contract, as nearly as circumstances will now permit. The facts that constitute the equity are quite clear in this case, and therefore the verdict to establish them is not needed, and we can correct the judgment here without it.</p>
