In this case, the words of the will (after the testator made some provision for his housekeeper, for the sale of his real estate, gathering of his other incomes, and the payment of his debts) are, ‘then the residue shall be divided among my next heirs, in equal shares, or to their children, if their parents should not be living.’ It is admitted that the testator, at the time of making his will,' had neither wife, father, mother, brother, or sister living — could he, therefore, have meant them or any of them ? or did he mean his nephews and nieces, children of his deceased brothers and sisters, and their children, if deceased ? We are told, that the next of kin, according to the statute of distribution living at the execution of a will, or death of an intestate, are entitled to the estate.
