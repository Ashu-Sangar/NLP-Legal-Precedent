This is the true line, if the line has not since been altered by agreement or acquiescence of parties owners. But a boundary line between parties which can be clearly traced, may have been altered by the acts or agreements of the adjoiners; a man is not obliged to build his fence on the line; he may place it within his own line, and he is in constructive possession to the actual boundaries of bis land. But the fence may become the line by his suffering his neighbour to take adverse possession up to the fence, and to continue it for twenty-one years. The plaintiff says the old worm- fence was the line acquiesced in by the adjoining owners, and that he and those under whom he claims had adverse possession up 'to the middle of that fence for more than twenty-one years, and the wall was put on the line so claimed.

The wall was a visible boundary, and if the doctor was in possession up to the wall when Hagey bought, it was equivalent to notice.

The prothonotary received the deposition and filed it in the ordinary course of such business; and had he given notice thereof to counsel, the rule of court would have applied which requires exceptions to be filed within fifteen days. For the want of such notice, that rule does not seem to be applicable; but as the exceptions now made would not have been available if taken within the fifteen days, they ought not to deprive the party of the testimony of a witness who has since died.</p>
    <p id="b412-6" data-blocks='[["BL_412.4",412,[332,740,1160,558]]]'>The charge of the court seems to have recognised the defendant’s positions touching the boundary line as contained in the title-deeds, but to have left it to the jury to find whether those under whom the respective parties claimed had not substituted an agreed or consentable line therefor, and held according to it for twenty-one years and upwards. The learned judge said that a boundary line between parties which can be clearly traced may have been altered by the acts or agreements of the adjoiners, and that Hagey would be bound by the wall built by agreement between Dr. Detweiler and MeHose, if he (Hagey) purchased from McHose with notice of the wall; and as it was a visible boundary, and Dr. Detweiler was in possession up to it when Hagey bought, the wall, it was held, was equivalent to notice.</p>

It is supposed, that boundaries fixed by parol are within the operation of the statute. This is a mistake. The statute is a rule of conveyance; it requires a writing to <em>create </em>an estate or interest in lands, that shall have more force or effect than a lease or estate at will only. But adjoining owners who adjust their division line by parol, do not create or convey any estate whatever between themselves; no such thought or intention influences their conduct; after their boundary is fixed by consent, they hold up to it by virtue of the title-deeds, and not by virtue of a parol transfer. Generally, indeed, they feel that their rights, as defined in the title papers, have been abridged rather than enlarged by the agreed line; and this, because their treaty proceeds on the basis that the exact right between them is doubtful. Out of the doubtfulness of the right springs the consideration which binds parties to such agreements. This is plainly .taught in the leading ease of Perkins <em>v. </em>Gay, 3 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>331. Surrender is indeed a mode of conveyance, and though at common law it might be by parol, it is now expressly within both the English and the Pennsylvania statutes of fraud and perjuries, except it be a surrender by operation of law, tvhen the English statute does not embrace it. But, I repeat, the parties to a consentable line intend no conveyance by surrender or otherwise. For the sake of peace and good neighbourhood, they agree that a doubtful fact shall be ascertained and indicated in a particular manner; and the practice of this court has been to <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>encourage such compromises. I do not know that it has ever before been suggested, that the statute of frauds and perjuries stands in the way of such agreements, but whether suggested or not, this court has never, so applied the statute.</p>
    <p id="b413-6" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[150,574,1162,774]]]'>Erom the allusion of the learned judge to a boundary line “ which can be clearly traced,” it might be inferred, that there was no doubt for the treaty of these parties to rest on, and therefore, properly speaking, no consentable line; but that line which can be so clearly traced assumes the white oak post between Dornblazer and Laubach to be the mark called for by the Heller deed and survey, and whether it was that mark or not, the judge referred to the jury. A line which depends on allowances for the variation of the needle, and the position of a post set so long ago as 1784, cannot be considered free from doubt, however traceable by its appropriate course it may be, if the position of the post be assumed. The doubt has reference of course to the starting-point, not to the bearing of the line; but that doubt infects the line from beginning to end. At the place at which this line became a boundary between these parties, or their predecessors in title, it was a fair subject of compromise, and if they fixed it where the worm fence had stood, and where the stone wall was built, the court and jury did right to hold them to it.</p>

The old shed is gone, and there is no motive- for preserving its foundation wall.

If the jury meant that their verdict should be measured from the middle <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>of this wall, regard being had to its length, did they mean the face of the wall or the centre line of it ? If by middle they meant that centre line, then where, in respect of its length, did they intend to start from ? The verdict throws no light on these questions. We see not how the sheriff could decide them. And yet decide them he must, before he could find the line the jury meant to establish.</p>
    <p id="b415-6" data-blocks='[["BL_415.5",415,[139,693,1158,345]]]'>From the draft before the jury, but which is not made part of their verdict, it would seem most probable, that they referred themselves to the face of the wall at the middle of its length; but on the other hand it is to be remembered that, in surveys generally, a line described as beginning at or running from a particular object, whether a post, a tree, or a stone, is to be measured from the centre of the object — and more certainly so, when not merely the object, but the <em>middle </em>of the object is called for.</p>
    <p id="b415-7" data-blocks='[["BL_415.6",415,[139,1038,1160,248]]]'>The vice of this verdict is radical and incurable. The practice of this court favours verdicts, but does not tolerate such essential uncertainty. The verdict cannot be supported upon the adjudged eases. It comes short of the great object of all verdicts, which is to make an end of controversy, and we feel obliged to set it aside.</p>
    <p id="b415-8" data-blocks='[["BL_415.7",415,[316,1296,983,77]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>is awarded.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b415-9" data-blocks='[["BL_415.8",415,[184,1425,1077,45]]]'>Read, J., dissented from the ruling in respect to the verdict.</p>
