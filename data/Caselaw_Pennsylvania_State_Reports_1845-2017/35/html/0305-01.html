The-eastern part of this 50 acres was the land in controversy in this suit; the balance lies north of the public road, extending on the-hill.</p>

There was contradictory evidence in reference to the alleged payment by Britton. The defendant showed title under a sheriff’s sale of the land as the property of Daniel Britton.</p>

      <em>“ </em>The transaction between Housler and Britton was a parol purchase. By its terms Britton was to have the east half of the flat land on the tract, and the undivided half of the hill land, and to pay one-half of the purchase-money stipulated to be paid by Housler, in his contract with McHarg &amp; Richardson. The parties intended to have their contract reduced to writing, but failed to do so. Britton having paid nothing, except the first payment of $75, abandoned his possession. Housler, who was compelled to pay the residue of the purchase-money, conveyed the whole lot to Felt, including the moiety Britton was to have. In this there was no greater violation of faith than is implied in every breach of a parol contract. We are of opinion, therefore, that this is not the case of a resulting trust, or of a parol trust, unaffected by the statute of frauds. The legal principles which rule the case <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>are stated correctly, as we conceive, in the plaintiff’s 1st, 2d, 3d, 4th, and 5th points, which we answer affirmatively.”</p>

The points propounded by the plaintiff below were in strict accordance with the law, as it has repeatedly been declared in this court, and the Court of Common Pleas could do nothing else than affirm them.</p>
    <p id="b307-12" data-blocks='[["BL_307.15",307,[192,1657,1154,597]]]'>But was not the case rather one of resulting trust ? The court below thought it was not, because the conveyance made by Housler to Felt, instead of Britton, involved no greater violation of faith than exists in every breach of a parol contract. This would be quite correct if a resulting trust could only arise from the breach of a contract. But it was the payment of the consideration-money of the purchase from McHarg &amp; Richardson, if anything, which gave birth to the trust. The testimony of Goodrich tended to show that a part of that purchase-money was paid by Britton, and if it was, the law raised a trust in his favour. Both Housler and Britton, it is t.rue, contradict the testimony of Goodrich in this particular. The existence of a trust, then, was dependent upon the finding of the jury as to which of the witnesses they believed, and this was not submitted to them.</p>

Even if Britton had an equity arising either from a parol contract of sale, or from the payment of a portion of the original purchase-money, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict and judg<a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>ment. That purchase-money had been paid only in part, and the plaintiff, holding the legal title, was of course entitled to the possession. To protect himself under his alleged equity, the defendant should have tendered the unpaid balance of the purchase-money, or at least have asked for a conditional verdict. He did neither, and left himself defenceless.</p>
