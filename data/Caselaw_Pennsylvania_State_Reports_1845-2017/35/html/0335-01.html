    <p class="summary" id="b335-10" data-blocks='[["BL_335.9",335,[128,1476,1158,261]]]'>1. Apolacon is a small and thinly-settled township, and the inhabitants are generally poor. There are seven sub-school districts in the same, and only one within the proposed borough; this district pays about one-third of the school taxes of the township, and if the borough should be incorporated, would leave the other districts too poor to keep up their schools.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b335-11" data-blocks='[["BL_335.10",335,[127,1737,1159,215]]]'>2. There is no central place of business within the proposed borough. The buildings are scattering. There is but one small store, nor is there any public-house or tavern, nor but little mechanical business done there, and one small meeting-house, and a great portion of said borough is a wilderness.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b335-12" data-blocks='[["BL_335.11",335,[127,1952,1156,171]]]'>3. The chartering of said borough would be unjust and oppressive to the people of the township outside of the limits, in regard to the schools and the school taxes, and would be a great grievance and retard the prosperity of the whole township.</p>

Why, here is ground enough to admit the plot of the city of Philadelphia, as it was before its late extension, and several respectable villages besides. It is a town or village that may be thus incorporated; and here is a little scattered cross-roads village that fancies that its true dimensions include several large farms lying around it, and gets an order to incorporate them land it into a borough. The fundamental mistake consists in supposing that any more than the village proper, with its proper territory, can be incorporated. All this land is not a village. We can declare this as matter of law, just as well as we can say as matter of law, that a river is not a lake, or a township is not a county; for it is merely declaring the meaning of words in a law.</p>
    <p id="b336-10" data-blocks='[["BL_336.10",336,[370,1554,1154,258]]]'>And it is quite unjust to give a village such an extension; for this puts all the farm-lands around it in the power of the real villagers, to tax them as they please, and expend all the tax for themselves. Experience does not justify us in presuming that such power would be justly exercised, when it can be exercised selfishly.</p>
