    <p class="summary" id="b284-12" data-blocks='[["BL_284.10",284,[323,1374,1152,384]]]'>The borough of West Chester was the owner of the water-works for supplying its inhabitants with water, and the main conduit pipes were laid along Market street in the said borough. William Apple, one of the defendants, was then superintendent, but his duties in reference to the introduction of water into houses consisted (on the production to him of a permit) in furnishing a ferrule and directing the opening of the main. He had nothing to do, officially, with the breaking of ground in the street, or with filling up the opening.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b284-13" data-blocks='[["BL_284.11",284,[322,1758,1153,202]]]'>Nicholas Mendenhall, who was the owner of a lot on the north side of Market street, erected a house thereon, and employed William Apple, who was also a plumber, to do the necessary work, in his business, upon the house, including the introduction of the water.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b284-14" data-blocks='[["BL_284.12",284,[322,1971,1154,431]]]'>On the 29th August 1857, Mendenhall contracted to sell the house and lot to Gideon Miles, the other defendant, and stipulated that he would introduce the water, and pay all the bills therefor. Mendenhall, accordingly, procured a permit from the corporate authorities, and delivered it to Apple; by whose workmen a trench was dug from the house to the main pipe, about the 7th October; the connection was made, and the opening filled up, by putting in all the dirt that had been taken out, and placing the stone on the top. This left a ridge from four to ten inches in height, which would ordinarily sink to a level in about a week.</p>

It is an imperious necessity that has forced upon our towns the substitution of public water-works, for the public and private pumps which we used to have, and that has made our streets the place where the public pipes are laid. These pipes thus become public watercourses for the supply of all private needs, and the duty of maintaining them, consistently with private rights, and with the common right of highway in the streets, falls upon the town authorities. But the private right of resorting to them for water makes some interference with the public travel inevitable, and so far the public right must yield. The excavations made for this purpose are for private benefit, done at private expense, and usually without any direct superintendence of the public; and only the persons who make them, or cause them to be made, are answerable for any injury they occasion to the right of travel. The borough had no hand in this excavation, and is not answerable for the carelessness with which it was done. The public fulfils its duty when .it furnishes a complete highway, and it is not <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>answerable for the improper inodes in which individuals connect their property with it.</p>
    <p id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[325,488,1155,815]]]'>Alleys and doors, and steps and drains, are necessary to connect private property with public streets, and branch-pipes to connect with gas and water mains; and when the public leaves it to individuals to make such connections, they alone are responsible that the work shall be done without injury to any one. Streets are necessarily used for telegraphic lines, and signs and awnings and hitching-posts, and vaults and vault-gratings, and it is not the public, but the individuals who erect such things, that are answerable for the injuries arising from them, though the public has power to regulate them, and does attempt to do so. It is enough for the injured person, that he has a remedy against the actual wrongdoer. Indeed, it would be most disastrous to make the public liable for all the neglects of individuals in relation to the public streets; for, in this way, it would become an insurer against numberless injuries of which it could never learn the origin, and for which it could have' recourse to no one. Thus the actual wrongdoer would be left unpunished; whereas, if the search for him be sharpened by private' interest, he cannot readily escape.</p>
