If not relieved from the effect which the law ascribes to his return, on some of these grounds, the plaintiff would be entitled to your verdict assessing the damages at the amount appropriated by the sheriff to the second execution, the one in favour of Brock, Emery &amp; Co., because Stevenson’s being prior in point of time, and the balance of it remaining unpaid after the appropriation made to it by the officer of the $598, and this unsatisfied balance greatly exceeding the amount now in dispute; it was a misappropriation and mispayment on the part of the sheriff to pay any part of the moneys made on the executions, to the second, until the first was satisfied. This rule, however, is subject to a very important qualification, to which I ask your particular attention. It is alleged by defendant that the money paid to the Brock, Emery &amp; Co.’s claim, was received by him in two payments, of $50 and $190, before either of the executions came to his hands; that he did not receive it in his official capacity as sheriff, but as the mere agent of transmission, for the mutual accommodation of the parties; and that, the money having remained in his hands, instead of being handed over to Mr. Eox, the attorney of Brock, Emery &amp; Co., until he came to settle with him for moneys made on the Stevenson execution, the money in dispute was apparently paid on Brock, Emery &amp; Co.’s <em>fi. fa., </em>and receipted for accordingly, without any view to its legal effect, and solely to enable the sheriff to get his costs on •that execution also. If you find this to be so, from the evidence in the case, then we tell you that, notwithstanding the return and the conclusive effect which the law attributes to it, the plaintiff here would not be entitled to recover, but your verdict ought to be for the defendant; and you will readily perceive the reason of <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>this. Besides the other considerations rendering it inequitable to hold the sheriff liable under such circumstances, there would be, under the facts supposed, a violent implication of the assent of the present plaintiff, by his attorney, to the arrangement; and Mr. Stevenson would be bound by what his attorney did.</p>

      <em>“ </em>Again, it was competent for Mr. Stevenson, by his attorney, to waive his legal rights, and assent to the appropriation actually made; and such assent after payment, would he irrevocable. Of such assent, the receipts given by Mr. Fox, who represented both claims, would, unexplained, be very strong evidence; and, in my opinion, conclusive. • He could not, representing the one claim, request or induce the sheriff, as his agent, to receive moneys from Koffel, from time to time, in partial payments, neglect or refuse to receive them from Mr. Rudy, until he should have received the whole, then place an execution in his hands in favour of another party, settle with and receipt to the sheriff for the actual proceeds of the personal property levied and sold thereon, giving at the same time a distinct and explicit receipt for the moneys received on the first-named -claim, and then turn around and on behalf of his present client, repudiate this whole arrangement, and, on the legal conclusiveness of the return which he would thus have, intentionally or unintentionally, beguiled the sheriff into making, compel him, by your verdict, to pay this money over again. Such conduct would, on the ground either of fraud or mistake, relieve the sheriff from the effect of his return, and put the case before the jury on its real merits, untrammelled by any legal rule.</p>

We did not, and do not, feel called upon to express our opinion in regard to the taste or propriety of this course on his part. We sit here to decide questions of law, not of taste; and considering him legally entitled to testify, we admitted him as a witness. His testimony is before you, under all the circumstances under which it is given, and of which you will judge for yourselves. It will be for you to determine, from it and all the evidence in the cause bearing on the legal question, whether Mr. Fox was induced to give the receipts, and do what he did, as the representative of Mr. Stevenson, under the belief, produced in his mind by the representations of the sheriff, or of others in his presence, that the $240 received by him from Koffel, or any part of it, was received by him before he had the Stevenson execution in his hands. If Mr. Rudy did make such representations, and they were contrary to the fact, then Mr. Stevenson ought not to be affected by what his attorney <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>did, under their influence. To hold otherwise, would be to permit the sheriff to take advantage of his own wrong; nor will it make any difference that those misrepresentations were made under an honest mistake, without any design to mislead, because their effect would still be to deceive. If the $240 paid by Koffel to the sheriff, or any part of it, was received after the Stevenson execution was put in his hands, then so much of it as was so received, would belong to Mr. Stevenson, even if Mr. Koffel gave it to Mr. Rudy, with specific directions to pay it to the other claim; unless, indeed, such arrangement were previously, or at the time authorized, or subsequently ratified, by Stevenson or his attorney. The reason is, that so long as the money remained <em>in transitu, </em>and until actual payment to Brock, Emery &amp; Co., or their attorney, the money remained the money of Koffel, liable to be reclaimed by him, or subject to his order, so far as the matter lay between him, the sheriff, and Brock, Emery &amp; Co. Even if this is not so, still the claim of the latter upon the sheriff, under the arrangement under consideration, would only be for an equivalent sum of money, not for the specific notes, coins, &amp;c., in which it was paid to the sheriff by Koffel. The lien of Stevenson’s execution would close on the money, the very instant it reached the sheriff’s hands; because, although the sheriff may, and is required to levy on the money of the defendant in an execution, when he finds it elsewhere, or in the hands of another person, he is not required to levy on it in his own. Indeed, an actual levy does not seem to be required in any case. The language of the execution act (Act 16th June 1836, § 24, <em>P. L. </em>765) is, ‘It shall be lawful for the oificer charged with the execution of. any writ of <em>fieri facias, </em>when he can find no other real or personal estate of the defendant, to <em>seize and take’ </em>(not levy) 4 the amount to be levied upon such writ, of any current gold, silver, or copper coin belonging to the defendant, in satisfaction thereof; or he may take the amount aforesaid of any bank notes or current bills,’ &amp;c.</p>

If they vested <em>eodem instanti, </em>then it is reasonable that the law, in the absence of other ground of discrimination, should give the preference to its own process; and that would let in the claim of Stevenson before that of the other claimants.</p>

Under the instructions of the judge, which are contained in the 3d, 4th, and 5th assignments of error, the question is, then, whether all that occurred amounted to a “ seizing and taking” of that sum in execution by the sheriff. If it did, he made a false return of Stevenson’s <em>fi. fa., </em>for he should have applied the money to that writ. There can be no doubt that when a sheriff has two executions in his hands against the same defendant, at the same time, he is bound to apply any levy he makes, whether of goods or money, to that writ which first came into his hands, giving the second the benefit of any surplus that may remain after satisfaction of the first. But can money, voluntarily paid to a sheriff with directions to hand it over to a specified creditor, be said to have been seized and taken in execution by the sheriff? If in any case it can be, the question that arises here is, whether it can be considered a seizure upon an execution that shows a levy and sale of personal <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>property, and a levy undisposed of on real estate ? The Act of 16th June 1836 gives the sheriff authority to seize and take money in execution only “ when he can find no other real or personal estate of the defendant,” and even then, he is not to take the money from the person of the defendant.</p>

If the Act of Assembly means what it says, he was in no condition to seize coin, for he had taken land, and it could not appear, except by a sale, that the levy was insufficient to satisfy the debt. Is he to be held liable for a false return because he did not do that which the statute forbade ? He made no false return of the plaintiff’s writ, if he did not, and could not levy that writ on the money in question; and that he could not is as certain as that he could not set aside the Act of Assembly.</p>

If Koffel, the debtor, gave the sheriff the money to carry to the attorney of his creditor, it was a trust, which the sheriff had better perhaps have declined, but which, being undertaken, he was bound to execute. To seize and take is an aggressive act on the part of the officer — to receive by the voluntary payment of the debtor, and to carry the money to be deposited according to the debtor’s directions, is altogether unlike the official act. Whilst the money remained in Koffel’s hands, he had the sole control of it. The sheriff could not take it from his custody by virtue of his office. Koffel might apply it to whichever creditor he pleased. And if he sent it by the sheriff, as his messenger, to Brock Emery &amp; Co., the sheriff, no more than any. other messenger, could violate his trust to the prejudice of Koffel’s right of application. But the sheriff has precluded himself from standing on this ground, by returning the money as made on Brock’s execution. That return, though unsigned, was properly admitted in evidence, and, under all the circumstances in proof, we think the sheriff was properly held responsible for it. But what did it prove ? Only that he had applied the money to the later writ instead of the earlier. But if the Act of Assembly forbade him, in the circumstances of the case, to apply it to the earlier writ, then the plaintiff in that writ has no reason to complain. So is the act written that it would have been a breach of official duty, as well as of private trust, to apply that money to the plaintiff’s writ, though it was first in the sheriff’s hands. He <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>ought not, therefore, to have been held responsible to the plaintiff.
