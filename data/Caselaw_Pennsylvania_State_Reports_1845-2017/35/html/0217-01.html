J.) instructed the jury as follows: — “ This is what is called an issue of <em>devisavit vel non, </em>directed to try the validity of a certain paper writing purporting to be the last will and testament of John Miller, deceased. A verdict for plaintiff establishes it as his will; a verdict for defendant sets it aside, and leaves his estate to go to his heirs at law, as in case of intestacy. The plaintiff is one of the principal devisees or legatees, and, of course, interested in establishing it; the defendant is the heir at law, and seeks to set it aside. The alleged will is impeached by him on two grounds : 1. That the testator had not testamentary capacity at the time he made it: and 2d. That it was procured to be made by fraud, and undue influence operating on a mind enfeebled by extreme old age and bodily infirmity. Either of these grounds, if sustained, is sufficient to invalidate it and set it aside.</p>

On the contrary, we say that if the jury believe the testimony of Samuel Roeder, that, together with the proof of the death of Jacob Grafley, the other subscribing witness, and of his handwriting, does amount to legal proof of the execution of the paper in question, as his will, by the testator.</p>

That, we think, is the case here. Samuel Roeder testifies fully that, although, for some unexplained reason, the attesting witnesses subscribed their names before the testator signed his, yet that the latter afterwards, upon the same occasion, before them, in their presence, at the same interview or sitting, signed the will, and acknowledged and declared it to be his last will and testament ; and he further testifies, that he was, at the time of so doing, of sound mind. This is sufficient legal proof of execution by him, as one of the subscribing witnesses. Remember, we are not now on the subject of the truth or correctness of his' testimony ; that is a question'which we reserve in full force for your consideration, but is not involved in the point of law, now engaging our attention.</p>

      <em>“ </em>Then as to the other witness, Grafley. It is in undisputed proof that he is dead, and that his signature to the will as a subscribing witness, is in his handwriting, and is his genuine signature. Now, under these circumstances, the law implies from the facts, that everything which the witness, if living, could swear to, belonging to a good and valid execution of the instrument, has been testified to by him. This presumption may be rebutted and contradicted by other testimony, just as his actual statement made on the stand, if living, could be. Suppose, then, that Jacob Grafley, instead of being now dead, were living, and had testified on the stand to the same fact which the law implies from his attestation and death; and suppose, that in some, one of these material fact's, he were contradicted by another witness, would it follow, from such conflict of proof, that the court could say the evidence in support of the instrument, is legally insufficient ? Surely not; because then, its sufficiency or insufficiency would depend on which witness was correct or believed; and that is a <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>question to be resolved by the jury alone, as in all cases of conflicting evidence, and not by the court.

The court could not assume that the statement of the last-named witness was. true, and that of the subscribing witness false, and on that ground, withdraw the case from the jury, and say to them that there was no legal proof before them, of the execution of the will. We could only say, that if Grafley was believed, the will is legally proven; if the other, it is not; but which is correct, which tells the truth ?

The latter was dead before the trial, and his handwriting was proven. This, according to the decisions, was equivalent to the direct, express, full, and positive testimony of Grafley to every fact involved in a legal and valid execution. Roeder, the surviving witness, testified that the testator was, at the time of execution, of sound and disposing mind. That he saw him sign his name to the will; and declared it to be his last will and testament; that both he and Grafley subscribed it as witnesses, at his request, and in his presence; that, for some reason not explained, their signatures preceded in order of time, that of the testator; but that after all had subscribed the will, the testator, with his finger on his signature, solemnly acknowledged and declared it to be his will, before both the attesting witnesses.</p>

Roeder makes express proof of a sufficient execution, by the testimony of one witness, to wit, himself. The legal presumption, from proof of Grafley’s handwriting, is to the same effect, so far as he is concerned, as the second witness. He is to be taken to have sworn to every fact necessary to a good and valid execution of the instrument. If, as to him, he is contradicted by his co-witness, that presents a conflict of proof, just as if Grafley were living, and, on the witness stand, had testified to all that the law implies on account of his death. Such conflict, then, as in all other cases of conflicting evidence, is for the jury to resolve; and the court cannot determine it as a matter of law. But, is there in fact, such a conflict of proof? I think not; for the same testimony and the same witness that furnishes the fact creating the supposed difficulty, also removes that difficulty, by showing <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>an acknowledgment of the signature, as well as the fact of the subsequent signature itself, made and done in the presence of Grafiey as well as of Roeder. The supposed bane carries with it its own antidote. The case, in a word, stands just thus: — There is legal presumptive proof, in the outset, in favour of the will; a witness is called to destroy that presumption by proof of a fact supposed to have that effect; but he, at the same time, proves another fact which is a perfect counterpoise to the one thus introduced. On what principle shall part of his statement, only, be received, and the other rejected ? Does not the fact proven by him, that the testator did sign and did acknowledge his signature, rather corroborate and sustain the legal inference ? How, then, could the court, with propriety, say to the jury that there was no legal proof of the execution of-this will?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b221-6" data-blocks='[["BL_221.4",221,[160,1005,1158,299]]]'>“ It is, at best, standing on very sharp points, to hold that where the testator and witnesses were assembled, for the express purpose of executing and attesting the will, and it was all one transaction done at one sitting, in their mutual presence, the mere order of their signing should avoid or affect the attestation, although, in strict law, such may be the effect. As the proof actually stands, the case does not depend on this principle, as I conceive.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="A0Gt" data-blocks='[["BL_221.5",221,[161,1304,1159,1029]]]'>“We have been referred to cases to show that the want of signature, or a vicious or defective execution, will not be aided by a subsequent acknowledgment. Rut here, the proof is of execution as well as acknowledgment. Besides, the counsel himself admitted on the argument, that as to Roeder, the proof was sufficient. The truth is, the cases cited do not apply, because they were cases in which it was sought to make an acknowledgment, not of the signature, but of .the instrument, take the place of such a signature as the Act of 1833 requires. Here, there was an actual signing, by a person who the jury have found, was <em>sui compos </em>at the time; and it seems to me that, if we concede (what is by no means plain) that the prior signing by the deceased witness, was void ás an act of attestation; still, the only question is whether the testimony of Roeder is not as competent and sufficient to sustain as to impeach the legal conclusion deduced from the proof of Grafley’s signature. Without his testimony, the legal conclusion would be perfect, and would prevail, for all purposes connected with the legal question raised by the first and second points presented by defendant on the trial. If the testimony given to rebut the presumption is so qualified or explained by the witness as to destroy its effect, I cannot see why the original conclusion the law draws, is not left in all its pristine force and efficacy. So believing, the first reason filed for a new trial, so far as it is yet before us, is overruled.”</p>
