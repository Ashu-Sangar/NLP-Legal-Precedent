We think this instruction is quite accurate, and is sustained by most familiar authorities. We think there is evidence that the defendants leased to Bittinger this particular vein of coal, authorized the sinking of the slope by which it was reached, and contributed to its expense, believing that it would, not extend beyond their own line, which was not so far out as they supposed; and that by means of this slope, Bittinger took out the coal sued for, and that he has paid for the greater part of it to the defendants as his landlords. Such being the facts found by the jury, the defendants are trespassers with Bittinger; 2 <em>Casey </em>489: and, the tort being waived, may be sued in <em>assumpsit </em>for the value of the coal taken.
