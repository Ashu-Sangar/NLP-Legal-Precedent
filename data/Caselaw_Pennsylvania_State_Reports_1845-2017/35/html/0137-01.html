Bringing suit as often as damages were sustained, was the mischief of the Act of 1803, which the legislature intended to remedy by the Act of 1836, in permitting but one suit and one judgment, but so moulding such suit or judgment as to give every one aggrieved, the advantage of a pending suit, as fully as if commenced but by one party. Why permit several suits to be commenced when but one can be prosecuted to judgment ? It is difficult to understand, how a party can have a legal right to commence a suit and have a good cause of action, but lose his right and be turned out of court with the payment of costs, without any default or negligence on his part; yet this may frequently occur, if suit may be brought by every one who has a cause of action, and but one can be prosecuted to judgment. The suit first brought, though prosecuted with due diligence, .may, on account of the absence of a witness, sickness of counsel, or other legal ground, be continued, and the’last suit tried first. A second judgment cannot be entered on the same bond, consequently, the first plaintiff is turned out of court, and must have recourse to a <em>scire facias </em>upon the judgment obtained in the second suit, if perchance he is not barred, by the intervention of five years, from all redress against the sureties on the bond.</p>

But if there is a recovery in the other case pending, another trial will not avail the plaintiffs, for the bond would be merged in the judgment for the penalty, and- there cannot, as we have said, be a second judgment on the same bond. In these cases, five years have transpired from the execution of the bond; the party, therefore, who obtains the first judgment defeats the claims of the other'; the consequence then would be, that our error of judgment would for ever defeat the present plaintiff’s recovery, although, perchance, his present position in having his cause first tried, gives him -a legal right to recover. These difficulties, and others that might be mentioned, must frequently arise, if more than one action may be brought under the Act of 1836. But we cannot suppose that the legislature intended to make the rights of parties depend upon the absence of a witness, the sickness of counsel, or infallibility of the judge who might try the cause, thus placing their right to recover upon contingencies altogether beyond their control. A second suit might work a serious injury to those made parties to the first, and could be of no advantage to the plaintiff which would not be secured by becoming a party to the first trial.</p>

Under the Act of 1803, it certainly would not have been; for as often as any person or persons were aggrieved by the official misconduct of the sheriff, he or they might proceed, by action of debt on the bond, or <em>scire facias </em>on the recognisance, and recover a judgment for such amount as he or they might be entitled to, and the same course was to be pursued by every succeeding claimant against the sheriff. But the law was changed by the Act of the 14th June 1836,'regu-lating suits on bonds with penalties, and official bonds. A system is provided by that act for suits on such bonds, and by express terms, all such acts as are altered or supplied by it are repealed. Under this act, a party suing on the bond of the sheriff, brings suit in the name of the Commonwealth, and suggests breaches and assigns his damages. In case he is entitled to recover, there is a judgment, first, for the Commonwealth for the penalty of the bond; secondly, in favour of the individual party for his damages. Any number of persons aggrieved may suggest themselves as plaintiffs during the pendency of the suit, and have their damages assessed on trial. After judgment, the remedy is by <em>scire facias, </em>and assigning breaches. So that either before or after judgment, there is ample remedy provided without resorting to a second suit on the bond. There can be but one recovery on the penalty of the bond, and hence it follows, that a plea of action pending must, of necessity, put an end to a subsequent suit, otherwise there might be two judgments for the same penalty, which would in principle be wrong. That such a plea will abate the second action, has been decided: Hartz <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, I <em>Grant’s Cases </em>359.</p>

The demurrer admits the truth of this return, and claims it to be insufficient in law, and thus raises the question whether the sheriff was bound to turn out of possession every person he might find in possession, even the legal owners and rightful occupants of the premises, and put into possession one who had neither title nor right of possession, because he had a writ which required him to redeliver the possession taken under the law by a creditor, with whom such occupiers had no connection in any way ?

But the <em>scire facias ad computandum et rehabendum terram, applicable in cases of extent, </em>did, or rather was at an early period, adopted with us in practice: <a href="/dall/1/0081-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Dall. 81" data-case-ids="12129386,12129512,12129659,1408558,1408564,1408595" data-case-paths="/dall/1/0081-01,/dall/1/0081-02,/dall/1/0081-03,/us/1/0079-03,/us/1/0079-01,/us/1/0079-02">1 <em>Dall. </em>81</a>; 1 <em>Sm. </em>L.62 ; 2 <em>Troubat &amp; Haly’s Prac. </em>tit. <em>“Scire Facias;” </em>and is recognised, and its uses explained, in the recent case of McKelvy <em>v. </em>De Wolfe, <em>8 Harris </em>374. It issues where the defendant, after, an extent, has paid the judgment — or where, by the receipt of unusual and unexpected profits, the debt is supposed to be satisfied before the period estimated, or where for any other reason the defendant in the execution claims a satisfaction or release of the judgment. A judgment on this <em>scire facias </em>in favour of the plaintiff, who is usually the defendant in the execution, entitles him to a writ of restitution; and the sheriff is bound to deliver him possession of the premises, extended as against the plaintiff in the judgment and <em>liberari facias, </em>and all persons claiming under him. We think, however, that the sheriff could not disturb an occupier by independent title.</p>

The plaintiff in the writ would not be guilty of a trespass by a peaceable entry on such, and if he would not, the sheriff would scarcely be. But that is not this case. Here the occupiers were in, as the demurrer admits, by good title, and of course, had <a id="p145" href="#p145" data-label="145" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*145</a>rightful possession. Assimilating, then, the practice under this writ to that under the writ of <em>liberari facias, </em>and I see no reason for giving it greater scope, it would certainly only be operative as a remedy against the party in possession, under the extent, and perhaps, to intruders. The 56th section of the Act of the 16th June 1836, is a transcript of the 6th section of the Act of 28th March 1807, and it provides for the delivery of lands extended to the plaintiff in the execution, <em>“ </em>where the defendant or his tenant is in possession.” If the sheriff should find a stranger in possession, claiming title, he should make a special return of the facts: 10 <em>Barr </em>143. In such case, only legal seisin could be delivered, and the plaintiff in the execution would be’put to his action of ejectment to recover actual possession. In England, as in this Commonwealth, up to the passage ofthe Act of 1807, that was all that the sheriff ever delivered to the plaintiff, and this out of regard to the possession of the occupier of lands and tenements. But to facilitate the remedy for the collection of debts of the owner out of his lands, the law was altered by the Act of 1807, and re-enacted by the Act of 1836, and actual seisin was required to be delivered, as against the. defendant in the execution, or his tenant in possession — but the law goes no farther. Why should it be extended in a proceeding so analogous as that under consideration ? There is no law requiring it, and we have no traces of any practice favouring it. As the judgment in the <em>scire facias </em>is not in the nature of an inquisition or office found, but like other actions operating <em>in personam, </em>it only binds parties and privies, and the execution upon it can have no greater effect, and hence the sheriff was in this instance without power; the parties he found in possession had title, and were strangers to the process. He therefore properly discharged his duty in making the special return of the facts upon his writ, and the court were right in overruling the demurrer to the plea.</p>
