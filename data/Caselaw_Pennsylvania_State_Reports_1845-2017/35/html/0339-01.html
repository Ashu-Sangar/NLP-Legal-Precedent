At this day, when both are dead, the intentions of the grantor and grantee can only be gathered from the records they have made. William was in the possession of the farm when the deed was made. He and his father were both widowers. William had a large family of children. John Brink was his father, and, so far as the court are informed, had, at the time, no other children.

It is, however, only evidence so far as it throws any light upon the understanding of these parties in reference to the deed of 15th September 1827. When that suit was brought to trial, and after a jury had been impannelled, on the 29th day of January 1840, an agreement was made by the parties and the suit settled. By that agreement, William was to have the possession of the land, with the exception of from two to four acres. John Brink released his claim for rent reserved, and, in lieu thereof, obtained an equal right in a ‘ fishery’ upon the premises. But it was distinctly stated in the agreement, that ‘ said possession is to be under and according to and in pursuance of the deed from John Brink to William Brink, dated the 15th of September 1827, except that John Brink released the rents, &amp;e.’ This agreement is witnessed by the respective counsel of the parties, and, it is fair to presume, was drawn by them, in view of their claims made at the time, and the protection of their rights. In speaking of the title of William Brink, the word ‘possession’ only is used. If the title to the land was absolutely vested in William Brink for life, and after-wards in his children, why treat about it, and why refer to that deed ? It was not in the power of John Brink to alter or change <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>it, and William was sufficiently bound by its conditions.

His disposition towards the children provided for in the deed, would seem to have undergone no change when he devised it to them ‘ and to their heirs and assigns for ever.’ The following clause in his will, it is admitted, described the same land as that conveyed by the deed, and is as follows, to wit:</p>

All of his acts left upon record forbid that conclusion. The interest he manifested in the management of the farm, his claim to the fishery, the settlement of the action of ejectment, and lastly, his will, all give evidence that he regarded the estate in William as a life estate only. But does not the very language of the deed itself explain what was intended ? William had no wife and a large family of children. He was just in the situation to excite the sympathy of a parent, and his father seemed to be moved by his condition. He extended his helping hand in consideration of ‘the natural love and affection’ which he felt towards his son William and his children, ‘ <em>and </em>towards the better maintenance and education of the same.’ • In the absence of <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>words of ‘ inheritance’ in the deed, there is nothing to show that he intended to do more than to aid in ‘raising and educating’ the children.

Does that change the whole title ? Is it equivalent to the usual and ordinary words of inheritance ? Has it the same import as the word heirs, when used in this connection ? I think not; and, therefore, feel called upon to declare that the deed contains no language sufficient to vest the fee-simple to that farm in the heirs.</p>

They seem, by-their first answer, to have been undecided as to which title they would rely upon. Afterwards, they elect to rely upon the deed, knowing, doubtless, that if they failed in that defence, they could still fall back upon the will. The latter only can avail them.</p>

The amount, when received by executor, by the terms of the will, would belong to the general fund for distribution among the children of the testator. The interest accumulated amounts to the sum of $2925 — counted up to the 1st day of October 1859, a sum greater than the principal. The whole amount, now a lien upon the farm under said will, is $5425. There are eight shares, and when divided amongst them, would charge each child’s share with the- sum of $678.15,' with interest from the first day of October 1859. The charge, however, is an entire encumbrance <a id="p345" href="#p345" data-label="345" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*345</a>against the entire farm, and must be treated as such.

A testator cannot force land upon a devisee. It is to be regarded as a contract, and requires the assent of the devisee. When assumed, the obligation is a personal one to pay money.

Thus it will be seen, that both sales took place before the heirs had accepted th.e devise, or entered into possession-, under the will. Under no circumstances, can the sales so made affect the lien or encumbrance charged upon the land.

But we do not see how its terms can be satisfied, without allowing it to pass a life estate to the children also, for their several shares, subject to the estate of their father. This, however, is of little consequence; for the owners of these shares elect to take under the will, rather than put up with a life estate. The two estates are inconsistent, and therefore they cannot have both. Electing to take under the will, they must take according to the will, and must pay the sum charged upon the devise by the testator. The sum thus charged is made payable to the person who may be intrusted with the execution of the will, as trustee for the maintenance of the testator’s wife and minor children, and' therefore the administrator <em>cum testamento annexo </em>may sue for it; and it seems to us, that the Orphans’ Court is the proper forum.</p>
    <p id="b347-8" data-blocks='[["BL_347.8",347,[150,1299,1161,692]]]'>If the children had refused to take under the will, each would have had only his or her life estate in one-tenth,, and the charge would have fallen entirely on the reversion, and no more could be sold under it. Before they made their election, the shares- of two of them were sold by the sheriff, by virtue of judgments against them. Did these sales discharge the lien of this legacy against those shares ? We think not; for there had then been no election to take the devise instead of the life estate. After the sheriff’s sale, none but the sheriff’s vendee could make the election. Formerly, the only remedy for such a legacy was by a common law action, as on a constructive contract, and the judgment was personal ; but now the only remedy is in the Orphans’ Court, and payment can be enforced only “out of the real estate” devised and charged-. Such is the nature of the decree in this case; but it is erroneous in charging each share with the whole legacy, instead of its proportion thereof. Thus far we must reform it. -</p>
