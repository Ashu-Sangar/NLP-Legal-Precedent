In the 8th lecture of <em>Smith on Landlord and Tenant, </em>p. 221, referring to the tenancy of one holding over after the expiration of the lease, we find as follows: <em>“ </em>The yearly tenancy thus raised is governed, not by the simple rules which govern yearly tenancies in the absence of express stipulations, but by the provisions of the expired lease, so far as they are compatible with a yearly holding:” see Rigge <em>v. </em>Bell, 5 <em>T.
