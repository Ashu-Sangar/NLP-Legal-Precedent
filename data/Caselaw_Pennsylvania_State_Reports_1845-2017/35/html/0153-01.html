He testifies that, at the time the defendants became partners, they assumed the payment of the then existing debts of the firm, equally with the other partners, and that afterwards, when his' assignees sold his interest in the furnace, land, stock, .and partnership generally, William S. Breitenbach, in consideration thereof, expressly assumed to pay the debts of the furnace firm, for which the witness Strimpfler was liable.</p>

He was a competent witness, for he is not a party on the record, and his liability on the original transaction had been, long before, barred by the statute of limitations. Suppose that the note might have been presented for payment out of Strimpfler’s assigned estate, it does not appear that it was done, and that estate appears to have been settled up. We do not see that Strimpfler had any interest that rendered him incompetent. The letter of Houtz does not seem to be contradictory of his testimony.</p>
