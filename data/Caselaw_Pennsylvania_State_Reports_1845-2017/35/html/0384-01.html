He resided near the store of the plaintiffs, and had been engaged in manufacturing lumber either for them or for C. C. Murray, one of the firm, most of the time. His business, his means of living and his resources for paying, it is fair to presume, were known to them. In July 1855, he settled with the plaintiffs and with C. C. Murray. His whole credits given him by both at that time, according to the evidence of Moses B. Young, were over $4600. Their joint charges against Keyes, he says, amounted to more than $5400. The book now in court and containing defendants’ accounts with these plaintiffs, Young says, was present on that day and taken into the calculation. The account claimed for in this suit amounts to $1022.27, with a credit upon it for $469.63, leaving a balance in favour of plaintiffs of $552.64, in July 1855. The account was kept in the name of John Keyes, and all of the articles charged to him alone. They were purchased during the years 1854 and 1855.</p>

The defendants reside upon it. It is further admitted, that the articles claimed for, were purchased by John Keyes, and went to-the use of the family, and that his family consisted of himself, wife, and one child.

I think a fair construction of the language employed will preserve its consistency, and render its <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>provisions adequate for the purposes intended. It enabled a married woman to acquire and hold certain property. When acquired it is not to be liable for the debts of her husband. This is the strength of the law, and very clearly was intended to be. If one feature in it above another claimed the special attention of the law-making power, it was to render her secure in her separate estate against the improvident bargains of the husband. To render it differently, would be to take away its vitality. It is, however, in the power of the wife to encumber it for debts of her own contracting; and, as we shall see, she may perhaps be held liable, under peculiar circumstances, for the payment of debts not strictly of her own contracting. The language of the act is as follows:— ‘ In all cases where debts may be contracted for necessaries for the support and maintenance of the family of any married woman, it shall be lawful for the creditor in such case to institute suit against the husband and wife. He is to first have execution against the husband’s estate or property, and on failure to make the money, may have execution against the separate estate of the wife.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[316,1238,1155,772]]]'>“It is contended, that the ‘family of any married woman,’ means one who is living separate and apart from her husband. I cannot concur in such construction. The act makes it necessary to sue the husband with her, and requires process of the court to first be had against his estate. It evidently contemplates a case where the husband is within' the jurisdiction of the court, and directs that his property shall first be exhausted in maintaining the family. If the act had said ‘ where debts may be contracted (by any married woman) for the support and maintenance of her family,’ such interpretation would not be contended for. For instance, where the husband refuses to provide for the wants of his family, the wife may incur the liability, only rendering her own estate responsible after his is exhausted. If she were living separate and apart from her husband, the debt would most likely be of her own contracting, and then why direct the husband to be sued, and why direct execution to be first had against him ? Suppose him to be beyond the jurisdiction of the court, how would suit be brought ?</p>

No such change is necessary. I think its language and meaning plain as it is. Only the usual rules of construction need he applied, to make all the provisions in the section harmonize. It must be read, holding in view the intention of the whole act, and the mind cannot fail to comprehend its meaning. I would treat it thus: <em>“ Or incurred </em>for articles necessary for the support of the family of the said husband and wife (within the spirit and meaning of the several provisions of this act). If the act only authorized her to incur debts by her own express contract, then such would be the interpretation. If she might otherwise incur debts, then such provisions would be brought to bear, in ascertaining the meaning of the language employed in the proviso. I am satisfied with the language as it is. Any other construction would defeat the very object of the law.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b387-6" data-blocks='[["BL_387.4",387,[139,1088,1167,1332]]]'>44 Why declare that the separate estate of the wife shall not be held 4 for the debts or liabilities of her husband,’ and at the same time, and in the same act, make it responsible for debts contracted by him, provided they were for the maintenance of his family ? A very large majority of those for whom laws are made, and nine out of ten of those for whose benefit this law was passed, do not accomplish more than a living for themselves and family. To render the estate of the wife equally liable with that of the husband, even for the necessaries of life, would be to defeat the object of the law. And if she may be charged, without her consent, either express or implied, such would be the result. The husband could as effectually encumber her property as if it were his own. It would only be necessary for him either to refuse to labour, or put his earnings in his pocket, and the storekeeper who furnished the necessaries for the family might obtain judgment against the wife, year after year, until he swept away her entire estate. If she had a designing or profligate husband, the act would afford her no protection; if she were more fortunate in that respect, she would not need its guardianship. Why should she be despoiled of her property, without any consent upon her part, and without the power of preventing it ? Such a rendering of the law would not only be manifestly unjust, but would be so grossly inconsistent, as to render the act a dead letter upon the statute book. The very object of the act was to protect the wife against the improvident and indiscreet bargains of the husband. In misfortune, to secure to her from the grasp of his creditors, a home, or the means of supporting her family, and to that end it should have a fair and liberal interpretation. I have given to it just what is necessary to make it effectual, and without doing violence to the language employed.

      <em>“ </em>What is necessary to render her estate liable in the absence of any agreement or consent upon her part ? The inability or refusal of' her husband to provide for the daily and pressing wants of his family might render it actually necessary to extend a credit to them. Some cause must exist to render the credit a matter of absolute necessity. As a general rule, the husband is bound to provide for his family, and it can only be changed for good and sufficient reason. The only rules that I can lay down are: 1. That the condition of the family is such as to require the interference of a stranger; that their wants are not otherwise supplied, and that without such furnishing, the family would suffer for the necessary comforts of life: 2. That such articles were furnished with</p>

It excepts nothing out of the enacting'clause, unless we can extort a difference of meaning from the two phrases descriptive of the family. And we cannot. The family of a married woman might perhaps be held to refer to a family whose husband had absconded, or was living apart from his wife; but then that expression occurs in a clause which requires them to be sued jointly, and which contemplates a joint proceeding, and a levy on her estate only after execution process against him has been returned unsatisfied.

Then it will read, that before judgment can be levied on the wife’s estate “ it shall have been proved that the debt was contracted by the wife, <em>and </em>incurred for articles necessary for the support of the family of said husband and wife.” And if that must be proved, that must be pleaded. It was neither alleged nor proved in this case, that the debt was contracted by the wife or by any person in her name, but a joint purchase by husband and wife is laid in the amended <em>narr., </em>and a purchase exclusively by the husband was proved in the evidence. The goods were charged on the plaintiffs’ books to the husband, and all the circumstances show that the credit was given to him. He lived with his wife and apparently supported her as any other poor man supports his family, by daily toil. The plaintiffs furnished him with a team which he used in lumbering for them, and in farming for himself on his wife’s land. He drew his supplies from the plaintiffs’ store — the credit being given exclusively to him, as their books prove, and to him alone have they a right to look for payment.</p>

This consequence must be accepted and is right for two reasons: 1st, that such debts are within the proviso to the 6th section, and therefore did not need the protection of the proviso to the 8th section: and 2d, the subject-matter of the 8th section, being debts for family necessaries, it is most congruous to limit the operation of the proviso to family necessaries.</p>
    <p id="b391-7" data-blocks='[["BL_391.5",391,[170,1952,1150,429]]]'>This then was an action in which the wife was sought to be charged as the substantial party defendant. She had a right to appeal from the award of arbitrators. If the consent of the husband were necessary to her appeal, we will infer consent from the absence of objection on his part. There was no error in refusing to strike off her appeal. It would ill comport with the humane spirit of the Act of 1848, to deny trial by jury to a married woman sought to be charged with her husband’s debt under the exceptional clauses of the statute — especially, after she had paid all costs, and given bail like any other suitor.</p>

Her husband’s name was there for no other purpose than to signify his assent to her defence of herself. But it was her defence of herself and of her estate. The sole question on the trial was, whether the plaintiffs should have a judgment against <em>Tier.</em>

If the record had been made up in due form, the suit would have been against her, impleaded with her husband, and then the court would have been in no embarrassment about the manner of swearing the jury or taking the verdict; but looking at the substance of a very informal proceeding, we consider it of no importance that the jury was sworn as to both "husband and wife, apd two verdicts taken, one against the husband and the other for the wife. Especially, is the irregularity unimportant, when on the same day the verdict was rendered, the husband voluntarily confessed judgment to the plaintiffs for precisely the amount of the verdict.</p>

    <p id="b392-8" data-blocks='[["BL_392.6",392,[305,1480,1150,428]]]'>It is not the case of an action against joint debtors, and a verdict against one and for the other; but it was, as tried in court, an action against a married woman and a verdict against the plaintiffs. That verdict of course carries costs. The fact that the husband came in and confessed judgment to the plaintiffs, does not impair the wife’s right to recover costs on the issue formed and fought out successfully by herself. They follow, as in other cases of successful defence; and the court having rendered judgment on the verdict she recovered, did right in refusing to set aside her execution against the plaintiffs.</p>
