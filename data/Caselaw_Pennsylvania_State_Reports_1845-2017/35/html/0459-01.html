Perkins, complains of' James Haviland and William K. Deacon, late of said county, who have been summoned to answer the said Martin Hayward in an action of debt, and the plaintiff demands of the defendants the sum of six hundred dollars which the defendants owe to and unjustly detain from him: — For that whereas the defendants heretofore, to wit, on the twenty-eighth day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and fifty-nine, at the county aforesaid, by their certain writing obligatory, sealed with their seals and now shown to the court here, the date whereof is the day and year aforesaid, acknowledged themselves to be held and firmly bound, jointly and severally, unto the plaintiff, in the sum of six hundred dollars above demanded, to be paid to the plaintiff, his certain attorney, executors, administrators, or assigns: which said written obligatory was and is subject to a certain condition thereunder written, whereby, after reciting to the effect * that whereas the said James Haviland had been arrested by a warrant of arrest issued out of the District Court for the city of Philadelphia under the Act to abolish imprisonment for debt and to punish fraudulent debtors, approved the twelfth day of July, A. d. 1842, on the charge that he had property which he fraudulently concealed, upon the complaint of said Martin Hayward; if therefore the said James Haviland would, within' <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>thirty days, apply by petition to the Court of Common Pleas of the county of Philadelphia, or to a judge thereof, if the court should not within that time be in session, for the benefit of the insolvent laws of this Commonwealth, and that he would comply with all the requisitions of the said law, and abide all orders of the said court in that behalf, or in default thereof, and if he failed in obtaining his discharge as an insolvent debtor, that he should on the day of his so failing, surrender himself to the jail of said county, then the above obligation to be void and of no effect, otherwise, to be and remain in full force and virtueas by said writing obligatory and the condition thereof, reference being thereto had, will fully and at large appear. And the plaintiff, in fact, saith that the said James Haviland did not, within thirty days, apply by petition to the Court of Common Pleas of the said county of Philadelphia (which said Court of Common Pleas was within the said thirty days in session, to wit, at the county aforesaid), for the benefit of the insolvent laws of this Commonwealth, as required in the condition of the said writing obligatory mentioned, nor did he, the said James Haviland, in default thereof surrender himself to the jail of said county, but therein wholly failed and made default; whereby the said writing obligatory became forfeited, and thereby an action hath accrued to the plaintiff to demand and have of and from the defendants the sum of six hundred dollars above demanded; yet the defendants (although often requested so to do) have not as yet paid the said sum of six hundred dollars, or any part thereof, to the plaintiff, but to pay the same to him have hitherto wholly refused and still do refuse; to the damage of the plaintiff of five hundred dollars, and thereupon he brings suit, &amp;c.”</p>
