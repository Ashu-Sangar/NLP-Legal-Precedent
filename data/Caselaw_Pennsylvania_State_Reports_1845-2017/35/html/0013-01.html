After his arrival, something was said about David Hamilton being opposed to it; the clergyman hesitated, but the family appeared to he willing, and George Hamilton (the husband of the witness, Elizabeth Hamilton, and brother of David) assuring him that he would stand between him and David, he proceeded to marry the parties.</p>

    <p id="b20-8" data-blocks='[["BL_20.6",20,[317,1349,1151,551]]]'>The learned judge was clearly wrong in submitting to the jury a hypothetical case of conspiracy and fraud in. giving the bond, for which there was not the slightest warrant in the evidence,which has. been all spread on the paper-book. Prior to the marriage there was really nothing but the unwillingness of Barnett (which was well known to his- intended wife) to prove what his real intention was, at the time of the marriage. As was well said by Lord Redesdale, in McAdam <em>v. </em>Walker, 1 <em>Dow’s Rep. </em>190 : “ There was no proof that Mr. McAdam did not intend a <em>consortium </em>vitce, at the time of the marriage, and even though he had not that intention, still it was not to be allowed, that a civil contract (as this was <em>by </em>the law of Scotland) should be avoided by a secret reservation of one of the parties.”</p>

The justice asked Copley and Joanna if they consented to be married, and told them to join hands. Copley dropped his hand and turned from Joanna — she took it, and held it until they were pronounced man and wife. Upon Copley refusing to take the hand of Joanna, the justice hesitated, but, after a minute or two, proceeded, concluded the ceremony, and pronounced them man and wife; Copley, during the whole time, said nothing. Joanna returned to her father’s, but Copley <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>did not return with her, and they never cohabited after the marriage. Three days afterwards Copley married another girl; both became mothers within' six months of the two marriages, and Joanna married another man during Copley’s life. The question was, whether Joanna’s child, Parthenia, was legitimate. “It is very evident,” say the court, “that the Ecclesiastical Court, in deciding upon the sufficiency of the assent of the parties, can regard only what takes place at the ceremony. We ought, therefore, to confine our attention almost exclusively to the facts attending the espousals before the justice; and doing so, we cannot say, that the mere circumstance that Copley had involved himself in difficulty with the overseers of the poor, by his previous connection with Joanna, and that he took the step he did with some reluctance, is enough to show that he did not yield his full and free assent to the marriage solemnized before the justice. To nullify, on such slight grounds, so solemn a contract as that of marriage, would jeopardize) in too many instances, the blessings which spring from the dearest civil and social relation.”</p>
