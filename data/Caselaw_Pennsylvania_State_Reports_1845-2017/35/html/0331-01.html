James W. Brown, .the defendants’ testator, acted as the agent of the owners, in taking care of this property. And in 1843 and 1845, without the knowledge of his principals, he cut off the timber, sold it, and appropriated the proceeds to his own use.</p>

That upon the severance of the trees from the freehold, Hannah Irwin’s interest in them, as personal chattels, became the absolute property of her husband, by virtue of the marriage; and this suit in the name of her administrator could not be maintained. 2. That if any contract was to be implied in favour of Hannah Irwin, it was a joint contract with her and her co-tenants; and therefore, on her death, the cause of action survived to the other co-tenants, and this suit could not be maintained.</p>

There is no contract, in fact, on which to ground it; and in constructing or implying one, we must have a duty out of which and according to which the construction may proceed. To enforce a joint or several duty, we impute a joint or several contract: 10 <em>S. R. </em>211; 14 <em>Id. </em>111. Now, whether we treat the defendant’s wrong as waste or trespass, his legal liability for it was to the tenants in common jointly: <em>Co. Lit. </em>§ 315; <em>Roscoe on Actions, </em>&amp;c. 665 : and if the tort be waived and a constructive contract substituted, it must be a joint one. One cannot, by his election of a substitute, destroy the primary action to which his co-tenants were entitled with him.</p>
