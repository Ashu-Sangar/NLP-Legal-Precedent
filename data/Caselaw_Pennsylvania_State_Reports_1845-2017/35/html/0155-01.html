The court, under <em>\ </em>66 of the Act of 13th June 1836, having ordered a writ to issue to the sheriff to collect the rent of the premises, application is now made to vacate that order, on the ground, that the tenant in possession does not hold under the defendant in the attachment.</p>

It is evidently the duty of the sheriff to make return of the mode in which the writ has been served. In the return, in the case before us, the sheriff does not state that the tenant in possession holds under the defendant. It is only such a tenant that the act recognises as <em>garnishee; </em>the tenant spoken of in <em>§ </em>66, is evidently the tenant spoken of in <em>§ 49. The </em>return to the writ, therefore, is defective, in not stating a material fact, and the proceeding irregular. ' Hule absolute.</p>
