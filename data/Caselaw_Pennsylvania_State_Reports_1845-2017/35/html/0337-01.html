    <p class="summary" id="b337-8" data-blocks='[["BL_337.7",337,[155,1122,1161,429]]]'>On the 17th June 1857, a judgment was entered in the court below, in favour of Sobieski Ross against Norman H. Rogers, for $225.39, on which a <em>fieri facias </em>was issued, by virtue of which a tract of 50 acres of land was levied on and extended. And on the 24th June 1859, Henry H. Dent, the owner of the premises, subject to the lien of the judgment, intervened, and obtained a rule to show cause why the plaintiff should not be restrained from proceeding against his land. The foundation for this rule was the affidavit of Dent, and the cause was treated in the court below as a proceeding in equity for an injunction.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b337-9" data-blocks='[["BL_337.8",337,[159,1552,1157,290]]]'>It appeared from the evidence, that the land in question was held by Norman H. Rogers, under articles of agreement with Sobieski Ross, to whom a balance of $225.39 was due, for part of the purchase-money. Rogers proposed to sell his equitable interest to Dent, who declined purchasing it, but agreed to buy the land at a price satisfactory to Rogers, if he would procure him a clear and unencumbered title for it.</p>

On the same day, judgment was entered up on the bond, and a few days afterwards, Rogers conveyed the land to Dent, who had no knowledge of the existence of the judgment.</p>

If Dent had a right to restrain Ross from proceeding against the land purchased from Ross’s debtor, Rogers, it was .right to adopt the equity form for restraining him; but then it ought to have been by a separate suit, and hot by intervening in the original case wherein he was no party.. This is quite anomalous, and is an example that ought not to be followed.</p>
