That out of said residuary estate, said surviving executors invested for this trust four thousand dollars ($4000) in a mortgage well secured on a house in New York, the interest whereon was paid to the trustees by the successive owners of the mortgaged premises, and for aught that appears to the contrary was paid over by the trustees to Mrs. Berryhill. That this investment continued from May 1st 1830, until 19th of May 1840, when it was paid off under the following circumstances, viz., the mortgage-papers had been in charge of Jacob Hauptman, who lived in New York, but John Hauptman, in 1836, under pretence of wanting to look at them, w’atehed where his brother put them, and afterwards, as he subsequently boasted, clandestinely took them away and kept them until the mortgage was paid off; that he received for interest thereon six per cent., or $240 per annum, which, up to May 1st <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>1839, he paid Mrs. Berryhill, less five per cent, commissions, which he always deducted. When the interest to May 1st 1839 was paid, he notified the owner that one year therefrom he would require the principal, the owner not seeking to pay it off, and being willing to let it remain. Accordingly, on May 19th 1840, he received payment in full of the $4000, the principal of the mortgage, and entered satisfaction thereon, styling himself in the entry of ‘ Surv’g Ex’r.,’ inducing the officer to believe that he was sole surviving executor, which was not the fact, as his co-executor, Jacob Hauptman, was in full life, though he never knew of the breaking up of the investment until afterwards, and John Hauptman never reinvested the money, or at least there was no evidence that he did so: on the contrary, it was in proof from his declaration and actions, that he meant to keep the $4000 for himself, and only to pay Mrs. Berryhill during her lifetime such interest as he thought proper. He repeatedly declared, and sometimes in the most profane manner, that her daughter, Mrs. Irwin, should have no part of the principal. His mode of paying interest to Mrs. Berryhill was as follows: First he determined to pay her but five per cent., or $200 per annum, which he said was Pennsylvania interest, then he deducted from it five per cent., or $10, for his commissions, and $8 more as his travelling expenses to and from New York, whither he would insist upon going to carry her the money, though requested to remit by draft and save this unnecessary expense; that he was a man of high temper and violent passions, his sister stood in awe of him, and for peace sake submitted to his exactions, he always insisting at every payment upon a receipt in full of all demands. These visits to New York and interviews with Mrs. Berryhill were usually thus unpleasant from his behaviour, and in this way she got but $182 per annum instead of $240, which was the annual interest on the mortgage, or $228, if his commissions be deducted. On one occasion when he did not come on as usual to pay her, she came with her daughter to Philadelphia to get her money, but instead of paying her, he went back to New York with her on her return, and there paid her $182 as usual. He did not pay the interest in 1853, whereupon plaintiff and her daughter came to Philadelphia, where he paid her $100 on account, which was the last money she received, lie died in February 1854, intestate, leaving a widow, the defendant, who administered, and leaving also real estate.</p>

And even when in Philadelphia herself, he would refuse to pay her what was due to her, but travelled to New York after her, and paid it there. Whether he was actuated by wantonness to diminish her income, or designed, by violence and abuse, to compel her to give a receipt in full, under the mistaken hope to bind her by it, it matters little, neither motive will entitle services impelled by it to respect, much less to compensation. Until faithlessness shall be as meritorious as its opposite, conduct like that of the trustee can not be compensated; and no receipt will foreclose an account to include such an item.</p>
