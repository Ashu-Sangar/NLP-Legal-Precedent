      <p id="b59-16" data-blocks='[["BL_59.17",59,[155,2045,1152,378]]]'>Porter, J. — In describing the note in his declaration, the plaintiff missed the date by a year. When the trial came on, the defendant's counsel was prevented from attending. If he had attended and taken the point, an amendment would have been allowed; it is just the case for the exercise of such a power. In this court, we can give him no help, for an objection, curable by amendment, if not made on the trial, is deemed to have been waived: 2 <em>Gasey </em>333. If the objection had been made there, the later cases would have permitted to cure it here: 11 <em>W. &lt;&amp; S. </em>365; 5 <em>Harris </em>173; 10 <em><a href="/citations/?q=15%20Leg.%20Int.%2083" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="15 Leg.

Whether it were taken or not, the result would be the same; and this is but an instance of the growing disposition of the law to brush aside every formal obstacle in the way of substantial justice. Judgment affirmed.</p>
