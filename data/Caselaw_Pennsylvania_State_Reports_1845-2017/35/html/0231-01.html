The bill further states that Francis Greenwall is the tenant of said premises from year to year, from the first day of June, and that he has had no notice to quit, and also that Lehigh avenue and Coral street are laid out through said property,, and that a notice was received by James Mifflin, one of the <em>cestui que trusts,. </em>signed Conrad B.

      <p id="Aca" data-blocks='[["BL_232.2",232,[325,643,1153,174]]]'>“ The proceedings to open! said streets are rested solely on the seventh section of the' Supplement to the Act of Consolidation, passed April 21st 1855, wherein it is provided that councils may, whenever they deem the public exigency to demand it, by ordinance, require any street laid down on any public plan of the city, to be opened, giving three months’ notice to the owner.</p>
      <p id="AS4" data-blocks='[["BL_232.3",232,[324,816,1152,203]]]'>“We think that there is a very general misapprehension of the scope as well as of the spirit and intent of this Act of Assembly. By many it seems to be supposed, that it either ousts the jurisdiction of the Quarter Sessions, or gives to councils a general concurrent jurisdiction as to opening streets laid down on the confirmed plans of the city; neither of these conclusions is well founded, as a careful examination of the law will show.</p>
      <p id="AdZ" data-blocks='[["BL_232.4",232,[324,1021,1155,784]]]'>“ No interference with the ordinary procedure, which is by petition of persons owning property on or near the line of the street designed to be opened, was intended; an application for this purpose can only be successful when the court becomes satisfied that the improvements of the neighbourhood require such street to be thrown open to public use. But the Act of 1855, on the contrary, is intended only for special cases, requiring immediate or speedy action, as they may from time to time arise, and are to be considered only as exceptions to the general rule; for councils are only empowered to direct a street to be opened when in their judgment the public <em>exigency </em>demands it. An exigency of this nature contemplates the existence of a state of facts, when there is an urgent want or need; a pressing necessity for the opening of a street or road; a case which demands immediate action-, and which cannot, without prejudice to the interests of the public, be subjected to the delay incident to the usual course of petition to the Court of Quarter Sessions. It is true, that councils are made the exclusive judges of the existence of the public exigency, which demands the throwing open of a street to common use, and when they have decided that a ease is one proper for their affirmative action, there is no review of that decision here or elsewhere. But whether councils rightfully or wrongfully exercise the discretion vested in them, it is our duty to say, in construing this Act of Assembly, that in no case should they, by ordinance directing the opening of a street, affirm the existence of a pressing necessity for such action, unless clearly satisfied that such is the case.</p>

Then follows a restriction of the power conferred upon the city, as follows: ‘Provided, that security shall be given by the said city, to the owner, for the payment of such damages, before the ground shall be actually taken.’ The language is clear and of easy comprehension; before the owner’s ground shall be actually taken, he is entitled to call upon the city for security, to indemnify him for the loss of his property, about to be taken from him at the demand of the public; and that special- security is contemplated in each case is apparent from that which follows: ‘The city may indemnify the persons entering such security.’ In this the law is consistent with itself, by first giving councils power to act in special and excepted cases; and that they may not be impeded in their action, when the public exigency requires them to proceed, by what might otherwise present itself as a constitutional barrier, in the way of their progress, provision is made for securing the payment of <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>damages before the land, of the owner shall- be appropriated to public use. This is in strict accordance with the 4th section of the 7th article of the Constitution, which prohibits the legislature from investing any corporate body or individual with the privilege of taking private property for public use, without requiring such corporation or individual to make compensation to the owner of the property, or give adequate security therefor before such property shall be taken.</p>
      <p id="Ahg" data-blocks='[["BL_233.2",233,[179,887,1157,725]]]'>“ The provision relating to the assessment of damages, and the right to sue the city in default of payment, does not in any degree make against the conclusion at which we have arrived. During the three months succeeding the notice required by the act, the hands of the city are stayed, they can do nothing by way of taking possession, and if in the mean time the owner can succeed in having his damages assessed, his security can be measured by tha amount ascertained to be due to him. But, if he does not forthwith apply for the appointment of viewers, the city, at the expiration of the three months, may enter upon his land and throw it open to the public, first giving, in the language of the Constitution, ‘adequate security therefor/ This provision seems to be intended to enable the owner to speed the ascertainment and recovery of the loss to-which- he is to be subjected by the requirement of the public; for, until the amount has been fixed by the viewers, no suit can be instituted, even though more than a year intervene. But, whether the owner hastens or delays the enforcement of his right, the security which the law requires shall be entered, stands for his protection, and it must, in all cases instituted under the Act of 1855, be given before his ground shall be actually taken. This right to security applies as well to a tenant for years, or from year to year, who is the owner for the time being, as it does to the owner of the fee simple. See Frost <em>v. </em>Earnest, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Whart.%2091" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Whart. 91">4 <em>Whart. </em>91</a>; Turnpike <em>v. </em>Brosi, 10 <em>Harris </em>29; Railroad <em>v. </em>Boyer, 1 <em>Id. </em>497.</p>
      <p id="AIb" data-blocks='[["BL_233.3",233,[178,1611,1160,580]]]'>“ All this is apart from the question, raised by the defendants upon the argument of the motion for an injunction, of the sufficiency of the security as it exists in the general liability of the city; for where we find'an express direction in the law too plain, we think, to be misunderstood, it were useless to enter upon the discussion of a more doubtful question thus suggested; but it may not be amiss to say that it is by no means clear that, as the law now stands, there is any such security as that relied upon. <em>The Act of the </em>21 <em>st of April </em>1858 <em>relieves the city of Philadelphia from all liability for damages for opening, widening, or vacating streets; </em>and requires the juries to assess the same among and against such <em>owners </em>of land as shall be benefited thereby. It is true, that such liability may be assumed by the city, .by two-thirds of the members of each branch of councils voting to provide for the payment of such damages out of the city treasury. And when thus assumed, a tax may doubtless be imposed to provide a fund for their payment, but not otherwise; for, without such assumption there is no liability, and it would seem to follow as a consequence, no security in the supposed obligation of the city to the owners of the land taken.</p>

In Sharpless <em>v. </em>West Chester, 2 <em>Phila. R. </em>130, the Supreme Court held that, where an act authorized tho taking of property for public use, and made no provision for the payment of damages to the owner, payment or security therefor would be required before the taking of the land. These cases seemed to be in point, did it become necessary to pass upon this question. -</p>
