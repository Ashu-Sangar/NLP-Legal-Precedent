      <em>“ </em>It is manifest, from the introductory clause in the will, that the testator did not intend to dispose of all his estate by his will, but that deeds and notes had been or were to be given to his children, fixing their individual rights in portions of his estate, and that the will was only to operate on his <em>‘ remaining real and personal estate</em>

      <em>“ </em>The necessary inference then is, that, while he disposed of a portion of his property by will, it was his intention, during the time life should still be extended to him, to arrange the disposition of other portions of it. The intention how among his children he should dispose of it, was left incomplete, even if then known to himself, at the time he made his will, and not perfected, as the will states, at his death, by his leaving real estate of which he died intestate. He never did carry this intention into effect, though he lived a year and two months after making his will, but for some reason only known to himself, did not give to his children deeds and notes covering all the estate undisposed of by will, but died leaving it apparently to descend under the statutes. If there had been in his will a clear and definite intent expressed as to one of his heirs, referring in the same will to the means and mode by which he proposed to dispose of afterwards other portions of his property, such disposition being merely in embryo and liable to change, and he dying without perfecting this disposition in the way he proposed, or in any other way, but leaving the property to descend under the intestate laws, would a court be justified in saying that when he thus refrained from perfecting his proposed disposition of property among his other descendants, <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>leaving undone that which he had full opportunity to do, if his intention had not changed, they would carry out this original intention, partially expressed in a will, in defiance of this apparent alteration of his views ? The intent expressed in the will as to the grandchild, if it has reference to other estate, is merely correlative to the thought and intent then in the mind of the testator, that his other property should go to his other children by deeds and notes, to be given in payment of their claims upon him for services rendered, and not by devise or bequest.</p>

Does it follow that his children <em>alone, </em>exclusive of the grandchild, are to take the property contrary to the descent provided by the statutes, when he must have known that so far as its descendible character it .must descend to all; in other-words, that because he once intended to divide it, or rather make it available to his children according to his own opinion of right, but concluded not or neglected to do so, the law must now be prevented from dividing it according to its rule of division ?</p>

We have already stated that it refers only to a certain portion of his estate remaining for distribution after his proposed disposition of other portions by himself, but which disposition he never carried into effect. He devises and bequeaths to his wife real and personal property, and then gives to her the interest of $5000 for her life. This $5000, after her death, to be divided equally among his heirs, with the exclusion of his granddaughter, the plaintiff, <em>‘ </em>who will be otherwise provided for.” Then he gives to this granddaughter, in substance, the interest of $2000 from the 10th of May 1858, to be paid for her support, and if she lives to the age of eighteen, the principal sum of $2000; but if she dies before that age without leaving any child, said sum to be divided equally among his heirs. There is also provision that if any of his children shall <a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>die before him, leaving children, such children shall take the-share of the parent; and he finally states the reason why he only leaves his granddaughter the sum of $2000 and interest. Thus disposing of a certain portion of his estate under the will, he gives to his other children, absolutely, after the death of their mother, the $5000 bequeathed to her for life, and the $2000 given to his granddaughter, if she die childless before eighteen. To .this granddaughter he makes the conditional bequest of $2000 and the interest, from the 10th of May 1858, he reserving to himself the right to dispose of such interest for her, during his lifetime. Looking to the claims under the will, the circumstances of the age of the granddaughter, and' the contingent nature of a bequest to her, and the age of the grandmother, at whose death the other children immediately become entitled to their portions of the $5000, it may be considered questionable whether the bequest to the grandchild or that to either one of the children is. the most valuable and desirable.</p>

There is a recital of an intention in the testator to dispose of other property, either by deeds or notes, which would be payable out of it, perhaps he may have thought to the extent in value of such other property, to the exclusion of his grandchild, but this he did not, for reasons best known to himself, carry into effect. How then can we, for there are no words expressly doing so, say that by necessary implication he intended to divest one of his heirs at law, when he neglected to effectuate his previous intention, or designate, after the will was made, how his remaining property should be disposed of, but permitted himself thus to die, knowing that by law all his undisposed-of estate would equally descend to his heirs, including the one now alleged to be excluded ?

We would here refer to Stickle’s Appeal, <em>5 Casey </em>236, as to construing the language of a will. If, where there are two inconsistent clauses in a will, the latter is to prevail as the latest manifestation of the will of a testator, countenancing even an apparent change of intention, how much more readily may we discover, under the circumstances found in the present case, such a change of the intention which he may have had when he made his will, by his refusal to make the deeds, &amp;c., disposing of his property as he there proposed to do, leaving it to the contrary of this, to descend equally to all his heirs ?</p>

This purpose is avowed in the first clause of the will, where, after speaking of the notes and deeds, he proceeds to dispose, specifically, of all his “ <em>remaining </em>real and personal estate.” Whatever, therefore, was not contained in the specific devises to his wife and granddaughter, was not to pass under the will, but was to go to his children, by means of the deeds, or in payment of the notes, which he intended to leave behind him.</p>

Yet it is no more clear that he intended so to limit her participation in his estate, than it is that he intended to make the notes and deeds ; in other words, the general and the particular intents are equally manifest from the face of the will.</p>
    <p id="b399-6" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[119,736,1156,560]]]'>Now, it is a canon of interpretation, that a will speaks for some purposes from the period of execution, and for others from the death of the testator, but never operates until the latter period. Hence it is, that after-acquired real estate will pass under a general devise in a will, unless there be words which indicate an intention not to pass it; a rule which rests now on legislative authority, but which legislation was called for by the decision in the case of Girard’s Heirs <em>v. </em>The City of Philadelphia, <a href="/rawle/4/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Rawle 323" data-case-ids="1823526" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0323-01">4 <em>Rawle </em>323</a>, just ten days before the 10th section of our statute of wills was enacted.

    <p id="Ax8p" data-blocks='[["BL_399.5",399,[116,1297,1160,1115]]]'>But, though Mr. Hitchcock lived more than a year after the date of his will, he made no deeds or notes such as he contemplated. What then ? Simply, that he died intestate as to all of his estate not specifically disposed of by his will. It went to his legal heirs. And whatever he may have intended when his will was signed, we must hold that he changed his mind, and that he intended, when he came to die, that the bulk of his estate should be unaffected by his will, and should pass under the intestate laws. If he did not change his mind in respect to the notes and deeds, why did he not execute them ? But if he did change his mind in respect to them, and yet left his will unaltered, he meant to die intestate as to the bulk of his estate. This seems to us an inevitable conclusion. And from this it follows, that Celinda would be entitled as an heir, for, as to so much of his estate as was not devised, no wish or desire expressed in his will could control its distribution. A man may, by his will, take his estate out of the intestate statutes, by devising it to others than his heirs at law, but if he do not, lie cannot repeal or control those statutes. However clearly the particular intent, that Celinda should enjoy only $2000 of his estate, may have been expressed, it must give way to the general intent, which existed at the death of the testator, that whatever was not specifically devised should be distributed under the intestate laws. For such is another rule of interpretation found in all the text writers, that where there is a general intent and a particular one, and these are inconsistent, the particular is to be sacrificed to the general intent.</p>
