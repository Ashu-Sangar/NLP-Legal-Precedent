      <em>“ </em>It does not appear here, why or for what reason this particular bond was given to the trustee, but it is argued, that being put in the shape of a bond, it is to be held the acknowledgment of a debt to the daughter, which, unless explained, will take from it its alleged character as an advancement. We have said, that there is nothing before us to show why the bond was given — no previous existing consideration, which the father was bound to pay or arrange, to or for the daughter; while in the will, he clearly declares that the amount therein given to her, is to be her full portion in the <em>bestowment </em>of his estate, saving only the unlooked for and mere possible circumstance of her poverty needing assistance; and he gives the reason why this shall be her portion, because her prospects, as to property, are more flattering than his other children. There is also in the special words in the condition of the bond, not drawn according to the usual language, providing for the payment of a sum of money to an individual, which on the death of such individual would go to his legal representatives, a particular clause introduced, providing how the money is to descend, to the half-blood relations on the mother’s side (in fact the trustee himself), or as the <em>cestui que trust </em>may dispose of it by will. Again, the sum of $30 per annum can have no reference to interest upon a debt; for it would be at a less rate than 2£ per cent, on the principal, which after the death of the father calls for full interest. This annual payment would seem to be a mere arbitrary amount, not fixed by anything, as far as we know, but the will of the obligor. ' Why, if it was a debt, should the obligor exercise any control over its mode of payment, beyond merely the time, when it might be demanded at his hands or at the hands of his executors ?</p>

The advancement or undertaking by bond is clearly of an equally beneficial character, and, for the same reason, it is apparent that, according to the 4th rule, it must be judged equally or <em>even more certain, </em>it is absolute, as all contingency is removed.</p>

Under the legacy alone, there might have been, had the father died earlier, a contingency depending upon the time of her marriage, which might have postponed the time for payment of the legacy, something later than that stipulated in such event in the bond, which was to be one year after the death of the obligor. Now such a difference is very slight, and all in favour too of the obligee under the bond. Suppose that instead of the bond being given in 1849, the money had been at that time actually paid to the trustee, as an advancement, it would clearly have been an ademption. Now we cannot consider that a-stipulation for the future payment of the money, which might, upon a contingency, fall due <em>lefore </em>the legacy, ought less to operate as an ademption, than the actual payment of the money without bond.</p>

      <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>Lord Eldon says, ‘there is this distinction between cases of double portions and covenants, namely, that in considering whether the obligation can be held to have been complied with, slight circumstances of differences are overlooked with regard to double portions, whilst a stricter rule must be applied as to the satisfaction of a covenant.’ We refer also to the caseHartopp <em>v. </em>Hartopp, 17 <em>Ves. </em>190-1, when the differences between the legacy and the after settlement were much more distinct than here, with a doubt also, whether the provisions of the legacy were not more beneficial than under the later settlement, and yet Sir William Grant, the Master of the Rolls, held the presumption of ademption not to be repelled. In the case now before us for disposition, all the differences, slight as they are, are clearly in favour of the bond and settlement, as has been shown heretofore. The chance of lapse of the lega,cy in favour of the other children, the residuary legatees and devisees under the will, brothers and sisters of the half-blood on the father’s side, now in the present suit the real defendants in interest, in this claim for a double portion, or after the vesting of the legacy, the chance of a,descent of. a portion of it to them, have all been taken away by the bond, and by the wording of the condition, the payment of the money therein being made absolute, and any right to inherit on the death of their half-sister taken away from them, and the amount made payable too at a day, earlier than a contingency as to time under the will might have permitted it to be done.

The argument was also pressed upon us, and sustained by many authorities, founded on the effect of the clause in the will providing for the payment of testator’s just debts; but we cannot discover that this has any application to the legal point now at issue. Such a clause is important, where there is a question as in tbo <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>cited authorities, between an existing debt of the testator at the time of the making of a will, and the legacy given by the will, where slight circumstances will make the exception, 2 <em>Story’s Mq. </em>§ Í122 ; but here there is nothing of this kind.</p>

If the father afterwards advances a portion for that child, it will be an ademption of that legacy, in whole or in part, as the advancements are larger, or equal to, or less, than the testamentary portion. And this may be the case, although there may be a wide difference between the limitations of the portion under the will, and the limitations of the portion under the settlement: Lord Durham <em>v. </em>Wharton, 3 <em>Clark &amp; Finelly </em>146. And since the decision of Thynne <em>v. </em>Glengall, 2 <em>House of Lords Cases </em>131, that a gift of a whole or part of a residue may be a satisfaction of a portion altogether, or <em>pro tanto, </em>according to the amount, it has been decided by the full Court of Appeals, in Montefiore <em>v. </em>Gusdalla, 29 <em>Law T. (Ch.) </em>65, on the 25th November 1859, that there may be an ademption of a residuary bequest. Lord Justice Turner, in the last case, says, “ In order to raise this question, it was necessary for him, in the first place, to establish that there could be an ademption of a residuary bequest. The argument was therefore first directed to this point, and it was contended, that all doubt on this subject was removed by the decision of Thynne <em>v. </em>Earl of Glengall, the argument being that satisfaction and ademption were on the same footing in this court, by means of the doctrine against double portions, a doctrine which dated from very early times. He thought that the principle was the same in both cases: namely, that a parent did not intend to perform the duty twice of providing for his child.”</p>

The effect of ademption is well and accurately stated by Lord Kingsdown, in the case of Hopwood <em>v. </em>Hopwood, decided on the 10th August, 1859, by the House of Lords, 5 <em>Jur. (N. S.) </em>897, 900. Lord Kingsdown says, <em>“ </em>At the hearing of this case, I was under the impression that a-settlement made by a parent on a child would not operate as a satisfaction or ademption of a portion given by a previous will, unless and until the portion provided by the settlement was actually paid; and that therefore, when, as in this case, the settlement was by covenant to pay at the testator’s death, both the covenant and the legacy were alike in existence during the testator’s life, and that the legacy would not be satisfied or adeemed until his death. If this view had been correct, the testator, by his second codicil, would have properly spoken of the ¿£5000 given by his will as a subsisting legacy, and it would not have affected the construction of the instrument if he had expressly confirmed it; he would have confirmed it only subject to its liability to be applied in satisfaction of the covenant. But upon further consideration, and on examination of the eases, I am satisfied that this view cannot be maintained, either upon principle or authority. The principle seems to be, that when a parent has given a portion by a will, and afterwards pays or secures the same portion by a settlement, the legacy is from that moment gone, and the will is to be read as if that bequest had been expunged from it. The language of Lord Cottenham, in Powys <em>v. </em>Mansfield, 3 <em>M. Or. </em>359, on this point, is, I think, quite borne out by the cases. ‘ The codicil,’ he says, ‘ can only act upon the will as it existed at the time; and at the time the legacy revoked, adeemed, or satisfied, formed no part of it.’ Then as to the settlement being equivalent to payment; when the father has provided for the child in a different form, the portion which he intends him to take, he has as much indicated an intention that he should not also take the legacy, as if he had paid the portion to trustees. It is not merely, that the child shall not take both — he has no option which he shall take. The father is held to have substituted the provision by deed for the provision by will, and from that time the legacy is at an end.” “ It is sufficient if the testator has done- that which in the opinion of the court shows an intention that it should not be paid. It can hardly make any difference whether the testator pays or secures to be paid the amount of the portion. In the cases found in the books, the term ‘ advancement’ is generally used, and I cannot find that any distinction has been taken between payment and securing to be paid.”</p>

      <em>Casey </em>61, and recent examples of its application are to be found in the cases of Ferris <em>v. </em>Goodbrun, 4 <em>Jurist (N. S.) </em>847, before V. C. Wood, and Schofield <em>v. </em>Heap, <em>Id. </em>1067, before the Master of the Rolls.</p>
    <p id="b538-5" data-blocks='[["BL_538.4",538,[325,570,1149,517]]]'>In the present case, there is no doubt on the face of the will, that the legacy to his daughter is a portion, and it seems equally clear that the bond of the 20th August 1849, given by the testator, with two sureties, to a trustee for his child, then a minor, securing the payment of exactly the same amount, within one year after his decease, with interest from its date, payable in his lifetime, and until its payment by his legal representatives, is a substitution for the provision in the will, and, of course, that the legacy is adeemed. No parol evidence was offered to explain or rebut this presumption, and the case stands simply on the will and the bond. The learned judge was therefore right in entering judgment for the defendant on the case stated.</p>
