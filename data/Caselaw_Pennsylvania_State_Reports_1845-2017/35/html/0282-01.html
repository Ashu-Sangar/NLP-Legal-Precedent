Ludlam leased to Simon Brolaskey, for the term of twenty years, the land upon which the building in question was erected, at the yearly rent of one dollar, with the privilege of renewal for another term of twenty years, upon the same terms and conditions. By this lease, Ludlam covenanted, at the expiration of the first term of twenty years, to take the buildings to be erected on the demised premises, at an appraisement, or to renew the lease for a further term. And that at the expiration of the lease, Brolaskey should have the privilege of removing the buildings to be erected by him upon the premises.</p>

The policy contained a condition, that “ if the interest in the property to be insured be a leasehold interest, or other interest not absolute, it must be so represented to the company, and expressed in the policy in writing, or otherwise the insurance shall be void.” Brolaskey insured the building as the owner thereof, without disclosing the nature of his interest in the demised premises.
