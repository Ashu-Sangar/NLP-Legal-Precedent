      <em>“ </em>On a covenant of warranty in a deed, the law has been, for many years, well settled, that all the vendee can recover, on eviction or failure of title, is the amount of the money paid and interest. We can remember when that question was still discussed. The reason on which it was settled is, probably, that the covenant is to run through all time; both parties have had the opportunity of investigating the title, and the vendee being vested with the fee simple, may make improvements of an expensive character, as mere matters of taste and ornament, adding little or nothing to the mere dollar and cent value of the land. In an action upon an executory contract for the sale of land, the rule is different, although there may appear to be conflicting authorities. The time between the execution of the contract, and that stipulated for the execution of the deed, is' limited, and generally to a limited period. The vendee would hardly be considered as justified or expected to expend money in mere fancy improvements, or any other than those which would add to the real value of the land; and therefore, it is put in the same category as contracts for the delivery of personal property on time. We can see no reason for any difference. Upon this rule, the plaintiff in this case would be entitled to recover the difference in price between that stipulated in the contract, and the value of the land at the time when the deed was to have been executed and delivered. This rule would exclude all the amount recovered in the action for mesne profits, taxes paid, and costs and expenses in that action. We must presume the jury trying that cause, gave their verdict on no other than was legal and competent evidence in it, and that the plaintiff in that suit recovered no more from the present plaintiff than he had derived from the possession of the land, or might have derived from it. <em>This we decide to be the rule, where </em>
      <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>
      <em>there h&amp;s been no actual fraud on the part of the vendor. </em>: It is a different rule from that stated in the plaintiff’s first point, and therefore it is decided in .the negative, and also the first point of defendant; and the third point put by defendant in the affirmative.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b26-6" data-blocks='[["BL_26.4",26,[333,581,1153,559]]]'>“ If the contract was made fraudulently, in bad faith on the part of the vendor, contracting to sell to the vendee land for which he knew he had no title, the jury would not be confined to the difference in price between that agreed upon, and the actual value at the time the deed was to be executed (deducting, of course, that which had not been paid,) but might go beyond it, according to the circumstances, by way of compensation for expenses incurred by the. plaintiff’s relying upon the good faith of the defendant. Under the rule, the jury might take into consideration the costs paid and expenses in the action of mesne profits, but in no case, the amount of the mesne profits itself, because that was no more than the plaintiff was presumed to have received from the land during the time he had possession under the contract.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b26-7" data-blocks='[["BL_26.5",26,[331,1139,1154,928]]]'>“ Whether there was bad faith or not, is a question of fact for the jury. Fraud is never- to be presumed without evidence, but may be drawn or inferred from circumstances; and there are circumstances in this ease from which the jury may infer fraud. Does the fact that defendant had agreed with Messrs. Fishers to a division of the land, by which the portion sold to Compton was transferred to Fishers — that he had received from the Fishers, the taxes he had paid on this part of the land as theirs — his avoiding to meet plaintiff on the day the deed was to be made, or at any time afterwards, and other circumstances given in this case, satisfy the jury that the defendant knew, at the time he made the contract with Compton, that his title was fraudulently obtained, or that it was defective and worthless ? or did he know, at an early period after the contract was made, and did not inform Compton of its defective character? If so, the defendant is responsible for the consequences of that bad faith, and liable to at least such damages in the whole, as will compensate the plaintiff at least for all his trouble and reasonable expenses incurred, for his money paid, expenses, and trouble. This is substantially an answer in the affirmative of the plaintiff’s second point, and in the negative of the 4th and 5th points of defendant; and the 2d point of defendant in the affirmative.”</p>

Now, that might be through mere inability, arising from honest mistake or other excusable cause, or it might be with fraudulent intent; and the <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>measure of damages would depend on how the jury should find that fact. It turned out that the defendant had not an available title to the land, but did he honestly think it a good title, or, knowing it to be spurious, did he attempt to palm it off upon the plaintiff as good ? A count appropriate to a special action on the ease for deceit was not necessary to a fair trial of this question, and, therefore, it should not have been permitted to disfigure the record. The court tried the cause as involving a single question, the measure of damages, and the ruling seems to have been that if there was no fraud on the part of the vendor, he would be liable for the difference in price between that stipulated in the contract, and the value of the land at the time when the deed was to have been executed and delivered; but if there were bad faith on the part of the vendor, the jury would not be confined to the above measure, but might go beyond it and compensate plaintiff’s expenses, &amp;c.</p>

But where the consideration has been, not moneys numbered, but uncertain services to be rendered in future, a distinction has been taken as to the measure of damages, which we had occasion to set aside recently in the case of Hertzog <em>v. </em>Hertzog, 10 <em>Casey </em>418: and see Malaun <em>v. </em>Ammon, <em>Id. </em>428. The law of this class of contracts is now brought back to the old rule of looking, for the measure of damages, to the actual consideration passing between the parties. If the consideration were services rendered, they are to be compensated according to their value — if moneys received, they are to be returned with interest. But the value of the bargain is not the measure; and so we ruled, not only in the case mentioned, but also in Dumars <em>v. </em>Miller, 10 <em>Casey </em>319, which, like this case, was from Erie county, and was also a contract founded on a pecuniary consideration.</p>
