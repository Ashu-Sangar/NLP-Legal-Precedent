      <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>The jury, under the instruction of the court, found a verdict for the plaintiff, subject to the opinion of the court upon a point reserved, as to the validity of the mechanic’s claim; and the court below subsequently entered judgment for the defendant upon the point reserved, and delivered the following opinion:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b131-6" data-blocks='[["BL_131.4",131,[125,624,1159,633]]]'>“ Both the parties to this case deduce their title from the same person; that of the plaintiff originating in a purchase at a sheriff’s sale under a <em>venditioni </em>exponas, on a judgment, and that of the defendant in a sale of the same nature, made by virtue of a <em>levari </em>issued on a mortgage. The sale to the plaintiff preceded that to the defendant, but the mortgage under which the latter bought, was prior to the judgment under which the sheriff sold to the former. The defendant would, therefore, indisputably have the better title, were it not that the mortgage was preceded on the record by a mechanic’s lien, which, as the plaintiff contends, caused it to be divested by the sale under the judgment, and which the defendant admits would have produced that effect, were it not for defects, apparent on the face of the claim in which the lien had its origin, or rendered manifest by the evidence given at the trial.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b131-7" data-blocks='[["BL_131.5",131,[124,1268,1158,772]]]'>“We are clearly of opinion, that this question must be determined solely by the record, and that all other matters must be dismissed from our consideration. If the lien stood as a valid prior encumbrance to the mortgage on the record, at the time when the plaintiff and defendant purchased, they were bound by what they saw, or ought to have seen, and neither can adduce extrinsic evidence to impeach the title of the other. I do not mean to say, that a mortgage of a title deduced regularly through and from those who have held it of record, can be impaired by a claim filed against a stranger, merely because the land itself is described in and covered by the claim. Such a doctrine would be subversive of the security of titles, and of that certainty and safety which the recording acts have sought to give to purchasers. But when a search duly prosecuted to the source of the title, would lead to the discovery of a mechanic’s lien, the effect of the lien on a subsequent mortgage must be determined by what appears on its face, irrespectively of what might be shown, if the lien were brought before a court and jury for adjudication.</p>

It is filed against twenty-one houses, situate on the east side of Fifth street, below Morris, and consequently cannot be good, unless all the houses are on the same tract or lot, so as to be capable of forming a legal whole or unit. But the description given in the claim makes it evident that this is so far from <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>being the case, that they are separated from each other by two different streets traversing the property from east to west, and dividing-the whole mass of buildings into three distinct blocks, which can in nowise be brought within the compass of one lien. The claim being, therefore, bad on its face, and such as the court would have struck off on motion, is a legal nullity, which can have no effect on the subsequent mortgage, and might properly be disregarded by the defendant, in buying under the mortgage. We, therefore, discharge the rule for a new trial, and enter judgment for the defendant on the point reserved.”</p>

By the Act of 26th March 1831, the claimant, when the buildings were adjoining, and built by the same person, was enabled to file with his claim an apportionment of the amount among the buildings, and subjected each to the payment of its apportioned share. The 13th section of the Act of 16th June 1836 made this apportionment compulsory, or otherwise such claim was postponed to other lien-creditors. This section was decided in Donahoo <em>v. </em>Scott, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Jones%2045" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Jones 45">2 <em>Jones </em>45</a>, to include a joint apportioned claim for work, although it and its predecessor only spoke of a claim for materials; but this was set at rest by the Act of the 25th April 1850 — expressly extending these provisions to similar claims for work done, and for work done and materials furnished. In Thomas <em>v. </em>James, 7 <em>W. $ S. </em>383, Judge Sergeant says, “ This renders it unnecessary to give an opinion on the question <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>which has been discussed, whether a joint claim can be filed under the Act of 1836, for materials found and provided, where the buildings put up under the same contract or request do not appear to adjoin each other.”</p>

The word <em>‘ </em>building,’ used in every act upon the subject,- was strictly applicable to a block which, though composed of separate houses, was put up as a whole, but it could not be predicated of separate blocks in different streets, which could in no aspect be viewed as entire.”</p>
