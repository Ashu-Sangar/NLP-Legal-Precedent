Then came the case of Rowe <em>v. </em>Young, 2 <em>R. &amp; R. </em>165, deciding that the place of payment was a part of the contract, and that no recovery could be had, without averring and proving a presentment there. This led to the passage of the 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 4, ch. 78, declaring that an acceptance payable at a particular place should not be a special or conditional acceptance, unless expressed to be payable there only. But this act applied only to bills of exchange, and left promissory notes as they stood under the doctrine of Rowe <em>v. </em>Young.</p>

The other, whether the alteration so made was material, and rendered the note void, is closed by authority both in England and in this state, and in the state of New York, whose .law on the effect of a place of payment being named in the body of the negotiable paper is the same as our own.</p>

And the same point has been repeatedly decided since the 1 &amp; 2 Geo. 4, c. 78 Cowie <em>v. </em>Halsall, 4 <em>Barn. &amp; Ald. </em>197; Burchfield <em>v. </em>Moore, 3 <em>Ell.

The words inserted there were, “payable at Wayne County Bank;” here they are, “ at No. 7, South 3d St.,” which, with the preceding part of the note, made it payable at that place.
