That the records of the commissioners’ and treasurer’s office were the best evidence of a sale for taxes, and the deeds the best evidence of its consummation; but if the deed were lost, or surrendered up, secondary evidence would be admissible. <em>“ </em>In the present case the assessments of 1829, 1830, and 1831 have been proved; and it is proved, that the deed was surrendered when the redemption-money was lifted, and the record of the acknowledgment of the treasurer’s deed has been read without objection.

This tract was sold for taxes, in 1832, to Hugh Bleakley, and a deed executed to him; and by the treasurer’s sale-book it was redeemed by Joseph Turner, agent for the heirs of Dunwoody, on the 9th June 1834, and the deed to Bleakley was given up by him. This sale extinguished all taxes prior to 1832. A second sale for taxes took place-in June 1834, when it was again purchased by Hugh Bleakley, and a deed made <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>to him, and on the 13th June 1836, it was again redeemed by Joseph Turner.

The only objection taken to the deposition of Jesse James was to certain portions of it, marked with pencil in brackets, which were clearly covered by the ruling in 7 <em>Harris </em>444; and no objection was made to the admission of the testimony of Albert Way, or to any part of that of Hugh Bleakley, both witnesses being sworn and examined, without any exception whatever. The court did not reject the testimony of James Turner, taken on a commission, but only an insufficient answer to the first cross-interrogatory of the plaintiff, the balance of his evidence to all the interrogatories of both parties being received and read to the jury. The court admitted as evidence, very properly, the treasurer’s sale-book; and were right in rejecting the letters of Joseph Turner and James Turner, as irrelevant, as had been already ruled in 10 <em>Harris </em>375. This disposes of all these errors.</p>

The court were correct in their answers to the defendant’s 5th and 6th points; and the 12th and last error was expressly negatived in 10 <em>Harris </em>376, the court saying “the defendant was not protected by the statute of limitations under the Act of 1804.”</p>

By the redemption in 1836, by Joseph Turner, acting for the heirs of Dunwoody. 2. By the undoubted fact, that the conveyance by Bleakley to Huzzard was, under all the circumstances, but a naked trust for the heirs of Dunwoody. In either, or both aspects, the recovery was a proper one, and the judgment must be'affirmed.</p>
