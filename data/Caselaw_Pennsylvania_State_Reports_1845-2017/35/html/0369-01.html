The plaintiff was a suh-tenant, or assignee of the original tenant. He had never been recognised as a tenant by the landlord. The demand, warrant to distrain, &amp;c., were all in the name of the original tenant. We are of the opinion that a mere stranger whose goods being on the premises are distrained, cannot claim the exemption. The original tenant may make such claim to protect the goods of his sub-tenant, or the stranger, but neither of the latter parties is a debtor within the meaning of the law, nor are they indeed within its spirit. The stranger, or sub-tenant, may be a very wealthy man, but no other goods or property can be reached or levied on, at least by the parties in question. The demand made and allowed to them must show against the original tenant, the debtor, and preclude him from another demand for the exemption of other property, which may be distrained or levied for the same debt.</p>

The notice of distress was on the 2d April 1858; on the 8th, the landlord had the goods appraised according to the Act of Assembly; and on the same day, the sale was advertised for the 14th April.

No subsequent assent of the landlord to the assignment, and no recognition by him of the sub-tenant, were proved. Neither the relation of landlord and tenant, nor of debtor and creditor, was established, therefore, between Wistar and Rosenberger. But if not a debtor for the rent, he was not entitled to the exemption of the statute. He was not, as the judge said, within either the letter or the spirit of the statute. That his goods were seized, was due to the accident of their being found on the demised premises. A stranger’s goods would have shared the same fate in like circumstances. But this is by virtue of the prerogative which the law vests in the landlord, and not because the stranger, or the unrecognised sub-tenant, is the <em>debtor </em>of the landlord. The account was made out against the Crawfords, and the warrant issued against them. They were debtors within the meaning of the act, but they claimed no exemption, and those who came in under them without the landlord’s consent had no right to claim it.</p>
