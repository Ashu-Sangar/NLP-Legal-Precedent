Kurtz’s Appeal, 2 <em>Oasey </em>465, must be regarded as settling this point. The counsel of the mortgagee question the policy of that decision, and its correctness as matter of law. But it is not for us to do so. We are bound by the decision of the Supreme Court <em>in eonsimilibus casibus: </em>otherwise all subordination and certainty in the law would be at an end.</p>

The argument is this: dower, it is said, is at common law, an <em>estate </em>in the land; that it retains that character in Pennsylvania, notwithstanding our statutes on the subject, in all cases of intestacy, where the provisions of the statute have not been observed; and that, in this case, the widow of Benjamin Garber, not having signed the petition upon which the Orphans’ Court appointed seven <a id="p175" href="#p175" data-label="175" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*175</a>men to make partition or valuation of his real estate whereof he died seised, and her consent thereto not otherwise appearing prior to said appointment, the proceedings, so far as dower was concerned, were irregular, without authority, and void, thereby leaving the widow’s interest still an estate as at common law; and as such, incapable of affecting the otherwise priority of the Zeigler mortgage. The answer to all this, however, is that by the 18th section of the Act of 19th April 1794 (3 <em>Smith’s Laws </em>148), the widow’s share of her husband’s real estate given to her under the intestate laws, is expressly declared to be in lieu and satisfaction of her dower at common law. The Act of Assembly, therefore, works a radical change in the nature of her interest or estate, in all cases, of lands of which her husband died seised. Where the intestate’s lands are adversely held and claimed at his decease, or where he aliens during his lifetime, without his wife joining in the conveyance in the manner prescribed by the Act of Assembly in order to bar her dower, or where, being seised during coverture, he relinquishes or abandons his right, or it is defeated by an adverse possession by the statute of limitations; in all such cases, she may still, of necessity, have her action of dower at common law, because the proceedings under the statute would not be an effectual remedy. But, wherever the intestate dies seised and the lands descend to his heirs, her right of dower at common law ceases, and she has, in lieu of it, either one-third of the land itself during life, if the same can be set apart, or the interest on one-third of the valuation money, if it cannot, or, in case of sale, none of the heirs taking at the valuation, the interest of one-third of the purchase-money. That dower is a statutory charge only in Pennsylvania, see Lauman’s Appeal, 8 <em>Barr </em>473; Hise <em>v. </em>Geiger, 7 <em>W. $ S. </em>274; <em>Prioe on Lim. and Lien </em>253; Galbraith <em>v. </em>Green, 13 <em>S. B. </em>93; Pringle <em>v. </em>Gaw, 5 <em>Id. </em>536.

      <em>“ </em>It must not be lost sight of, that the question here turns upon the point whether the parties knew or believed that in law, the lien of the mortgage would be divested by the sale, and intended to avoid this result, by a sale and purchase on terms which would, notwithstanding the otherwise legal effect, leave the mortgage to stand as a lien against the property, and pass the title expressly subject to it; for, if the sale was only subject to what the law would impose, then the law, and not their contract, must determine. Now it is very evident to my mind, from the testimony, that Weikel went to the sale under the impression and full belief that if he purchased, he would have to pay the amount of his bid to the sheriff, and the amount of the dower and mortgage besides, to the parties holding the same — in other words, that the sheriff’s vendue would hold subject to both. He says he was so informed by his*counsel, J. W. Hunsicker, Esq., on the morning before he went to the sale; and this tallies with the repeated declarations made by the latter, his father, Judge Hunsicker, and others, to the same effect, whilst the sale was going on, and Joseph W. Hunsicker’s own acknowledgments afterwards; and which show that the prevalent impression amongst them, probably founded on the opinion so freely expressed by J. W. Hunsicker, in whose opinion, as a lawyer, they would naturally confide, was the same as his.</p>

Nothing was said in that conversation, that is not perfectly consistent with that idea, or which might not have been said with equal propriety, if he had been urging an understanding to give him time on the dower or any other fast lien. It is true, as it has since turned out, that this was a mistaken opinion, and that the advice of his counsel was erroneous: Kurtz’s Appeal settles that. But it is equally true, that at that time, the same opinion was entertained, and probably the same advice would have been given, by many other lawyers besides Mr. Hunsicker; and we are not to attribute a superior degree of legal lore and learning to the laymen attending, the sale. And Weikel’s subsequent declarations and statements,, oral and written, are equally consistent with this view of the case,, nor is it at all reasonable to suppose, that if the parties had negotiated an agreement by which a lien of nearly $4000, equal to-two-thirds of its entire value, was to be imposed on the land, they would have left it to stand on a mere parol conversation, with no. writings, no witnesses called, no public notice, nothing in the conditions of sale, the deed, or elsewhere.</p>

Now is it conceivable that Zeigler, if he thought this,, would stand by,, see the property sold for $690, when it was worth over $5000, see his mortgage lien divested in land, and trust for-the salvation of his large claim, the loss of which it is now urged upon us will ruin him, to so frail a security as a loose conversation! in a corner, without writings or even witnesses, save what was-casually and imperfectly overheard by one who came accidentally by where they were talking ?

If anything, the reason is ■stronger than in the first ease. Now, in the case, before us, it is not even attempted to show that the consent of the plaintiff, on whose execution the sale was had, nor of the defendants, was had or even asked; nor is there one word of it- in the conditions of ■sale, the deed, or on the record, in any shape.</p>

There was a mortgage, entered in May 1825, for $5000, on which $4000 remained unpaid at the time of the sheriff’s sale. The property was struck down to Kelty for $1795. It was worth from $7000 to $8000. It was alleged there, as here, by the mortgagee, that the sale was made subject to the mortgage ; and that not only by the understanding and agreement of all parties, but by the terms of the conditions of sale. Other judgments were subsequently entered against Kelty, as here against Weikel. The real estate was sold as his property, and the proceeds, there as here, being brought into court for appropriation, Kelty’s creditors, like Weikel’s, claimed the money; and there also, as here, the mortgagee, who claimed priority of appropriation, by virtue of the parol agreement when the property was sold to Kelty, went into proof to show that the creditors of the latter had notice that Kelty bought subject to his mortgage, by express agreement, notwithstanding that in law, the sale would have dis<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>charged it. The only difference in the cases is, that in Mode’s Appeal, the mortgage was prior to all other liens, hut liable to be divested by the judgment sale, because the Act of 1830 exempting prior mortgage liens was not yet passed. In the case before us, the mortgage was not the first lien, but liable, for that very reason, to be divested in spite of the Act of 1830.

They say that it is not like the case of an unrecorded mortgage or deed, even; but that, at most, it is but a parol mortgage; to which, if it were competent for the parties to give the effect of a legal mortgage by reason of verbal notice to purchasers or creditors, the effect would be to overthrow the record-ing acts, and the acts relative to judgments and other liens. ‘ It would be inconsistent with the whole tenor of-our decisions, contrary to the settled policy of the legislature, and productive of infinite peril to landholders and creditors, and of strife and uncertainty to the community.’ They, therefore, conclude that it was unnecessary to inquire into the alleged notice to Kelty’s creditors, as, if proven, it could not have availed the mortgagee.</p>

The references to the dower and the mortgage, when they spoke of the subject liens, were couched in the same terms, and the two were always coupled together, evidently showing how they were associated in their minds. There is not one word showing that any distinction was made in their minds between the two, or that it entered any one’s head that, whilst both would follow the land, the one would do so by operation of law, and the other by virtue of an agreement to set aside the law.</p>

Yet this presumption would, on the principle <em>eessante ratione legis eessat et ipsa lex, </em>be a violation of the true intention in such sales, if extended to places where the usage was to sell subject to all former liens.</p>
    <p id="b186-7" data-blocks='[["BL_186.5",186,[331,978,1157,598]]]'>That was formerly the usage in the western counties, as abundantly appears: <em>Brackenridge’s Law Mis. </em>258; <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Rawle%20134" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="3 Rawle 134">3 <em>Rawle </em>134</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20298" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="8 Watts 298">8 <em>Watts </em>298</a>. And this usage continued until after the decision of Willard <em>v. </em>Norris, and The Presbyterian Corporation <em>v. </em>Wallace. Shortly after those decisions, an attempt was made to recover from John Gallagher and James Park a lot on Second street, Pittsburgh, by an action of ejectment on a sheriff’s deed, under a junior judgment, against a later sheriff’s deed, under an earlier judgment, and the cause was decided in favour of the first sale. But this did such violence to all the known usages of the west, that it gave rise to an intense excitement, and the claim was given up, and no such proceeding was ever afterwards instituted. The decision was erroneous in applying the presumption, founded on one usage, to a case that proceeded on a reverse usage.</p>
    <p id="b186-8" data-blocks='[["BL_186.6",186,[332,1575,1165,589]]]'>But this decision did no harm; for by common consent the old usage prevailed for past cases, and the rule in Willard <em>v. </em>Norris-gave rise to a new and universal practice, to treat a sheriff’s sale as discharging all liens, when no contrary conditions were expressed, and when the discharge was not prevented by any Act of Assembly, or by any inherent quality of the lien itself. To this extent the court has authority to sell, and to this extent the presumption of law is, that it does sell, where nothing appears to the contrary. In selling, the sheriff is the minister of the court, and is in law presumed to exercise all the court’s authority. At first, this presumption was very weak, because the usage was uncertain and fluctuating. Now the usage is universal, and is not to be rebutted except by circumstances that demonstrate that it was not acted on: 16 <em>S. R. </em>413.</p>

This was well expressed by Chief Justice Gibson, in The Presbyterian Corporation <em>v. </em>Wallace, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Rawle%20136" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="3 Rawle 136">3 <em>Rawle </em>136</a>, thus: “It is said practice, to be available, ought to be preceeded by judicial decision.

In another place, 1 <em>Barr </em>95, he said, that the rule is “ subject to exceptions, of course, whenever it cannot be applied without working manifest injustice.” Mr. Justice Rogers had before expressed the rule with a similar qualification: 1 <em>Penn. R. </em>112. The sheriff has certainly no authority to make conditions by which liens shall be created: <a href="/watts/8/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="8 Watts 48" data-case-ids="1848501" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0048-01">8 <em>Watts </em>48</a>; <a href="/watts-serg/3/0259-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 259" data-case-ids="1854571" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0259-01">3 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>259</a>; or excluded from distribution without consent: 10 <em>Harris </em>312; or discharged, where the law has fixed them : 6 <em>Casey </em>348.</p>
    <p id="b187-7" data-blocks='[["BL_187.5",187,[138,1125,1159,685]]]'>The regular practice, in such sales, is, to sell discharged of liens; but departures from the rule are inevitable; and a sale made on an irregular condition, and not objected to by any one, will be confirmed by the court. Thus, an actual contract is made on faith in public functionaries, and with the concurrence of all concerned. How shall we afterwards treat the irregularity ? Surely not so as to alter the contract, and cast the consequences of the irregularity upon strangers to the practice, if this can be avoided. We must, if possible, prevent the evil consequences by overlooking the irregularity, and respecting the actual contract, if no others have been misled by it. Official morality requires us to save individuals from suffering by the irregularities of legal practice. Yet the general rule of practice must stand as the law of such eases, and exceptions to it must come in only by way of equity; and, as equitable exceptions, they cannot be allowed without the sanction of the court, upon very clear evidence.</p>
    <p id="b187-8" data-blocks='[["BL_187.6",187,[136,1810,1161,546]]]'>But here we come to another element in the cause. After the sheriff’s deed to Weikel, and before Zeigler obtained judgment against him on the mortgage, several other creditors had obtained judgments against him, exceeding in amount the value of the property. Now, it is the very point in Mode’s and Randolph’s Appeals, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 280" data-case-ids="480155" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0280-01">6 W. &amp; S. 280</a>, 5 <em>Barr </em>242, that, as against subsequent judgment-creditors of the sheriff’s vendee, all ordinary liens against the title of the former owner, including legacies, judgments, and, before the Act of 1830, mortgages, must be regarded as discharged, if the deed from the sheriff does not recite them as continuing. As against such liens, purchasers and subsequent encumbrancers are not bound or presumed to look back of the sheriff’s sale.</p>

In searching, therefore, they found this mortgage remaining unsatisfied on the record. But it is answered that, on looking back near forty years, they discovered that there was another lien standing in the title; being a suspension, in favour of the widow of a former owner, of a part of the consideration on a sale by the heirs, to secure her thirds; and therefore the mortgage was not the first lien according to the Act of 1830, and is not protected.</p>

They saw that Weikel had bought at sheriff’s sale for $690 a property, worth at such sale over $5000 ; that there was still an unsatisfied mortgage of over $3000 standing apparently against it; and they knew that this mortgage was still a valid lien, if there was no prior lien which, with the sheriff’s sale, had caused its discharge.</p>

Looking further, they found that the Orphans’ Court had ordered that sale, and had directed that the suspended third for the widow’s dower should be secured by mortgage.</p>

Is, then, this state of facts insufficient to put a purchaser on inquiry ? Would any man of common honesty or common prudence, in buying Weikel’s title, suppose that he was dealing safely for himself, or fairly towards Zeigler, in treating the mortgage as discharged? Would any lawyer have advised a purchase of such a title without inquiry of the mortgagee? Surely there is but one answer to these questions.</p>

It is not necessary now to say what effect the legislation we have had since 1818 has produced upon the nature of this estate, for the proceedings in partition which resulted in ascertaining the value of Mrs. Garber’s interest, and in charging it upon part of the land in question here, were had under the Act of 1794, and there is nothing in that act, nor in any decision under it, to justify the idea that the legislature meant to reduce the widow’s rights in her deceased husband’s estate from the dignity and durability of an estate,, to a mere lien. It is true, that in Medlar <em>v. </em>Aulenbach and wife, 2 <em>Penn. P. </em>358, Judge Rogers speaks of it as a statutory lien charged upon the land, but the very point decided was, that it was so charged upon the land by the Act of Assembly, that the Orphans’ Court had no power to divest it and substitute a different security. To call it a lien by way of expressing another additional security for the widow’s rights, is not to deny its true character as an estate, and <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>this would have been harmless language, if it had not been understood, differently from its meaning, to imply that she had nothing but a lien.</p>

Accordingly, it was held in Turner <em>v. </em>Hauser, <a href="/watts/1/0420-01" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="1 Watts 420" data-case-ids="1838043" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0420-01">1 <em>Watts </em>420</a>, that her remedies were those of a landlord against a tenant. “ Without the benefit of this construction,” said Judge Rogers, “ the widow would be only entitled to payment as a lien or judgment-creditor.” This shows that when that learned judge spoke of the widow having a lien, he did not mean she was merely a lien-creditor.</p>

A landlord has distress as a remedy for his rent, because he has an interest in land. If it were' said he had a lien, it might not be absolutely inaccurate language, but it would be a very inaccurate application of such language to take it as ruling that he had nothing but a lien.
