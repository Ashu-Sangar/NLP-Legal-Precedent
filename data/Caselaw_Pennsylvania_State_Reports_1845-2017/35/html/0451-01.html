The answer to be given to this question is, that in 1811, the Supreme Court, in Steele <em>v. </em>The Phoenix Insurance Company, 3 <em>Birm. </em>306, decided that the assignor of a chose in action, although nominally the plaintiff on the record, might, on being divested of all interest in the cause, be a witness for the beneficial plaintiff, the assignee. This decision was the ■proper, not to say necessary, consequence of the non-existence of a Court of Chancery, which had led to the blending of law and equity principles in the practice of the courts. The principle of the decision was so plain, and so entirely free from all objection, that it was adopted by Judge Washington, with strong commendation, in Willings <em>v. </em>Consequa, 1 <em>Bet. O. Q. Hep. </em>308. It retained its authority undiminished and almost unquestioned until 1843, during which period there had been a succession of eminent jurists on the bench of the Supreme Court, by none of whom had a word in disapprobation of its principles been expressed.</p>

It was the only point raised by the bill of exceptions. The judgment of the court below, which was in entire consonance with Steele <em>v. </em>The Phoenix Insurance Company, was reversed. Chief Justice Gtbson, who gave the opinion of the court, after alluding to Steele <em>v. </em>The Phoenix Insurance Company, declared that the decision was ‘faultless in theory,’ ‘technically unobjectionable,’ ‘too deeply seated in authority to be eradicated;” that the court ‘ did not propose to eradicate it;’ adding, that the legislature was the only power by which it could be abolished.</p>

The assignor, though a nominal plaintiff, was not necessarily to be excluded as a witness for the assignee. Certain tests were established by which his incompetency might be infallibly determined; beyond which the decision did not reach. The sudden change in the law of evidenée thus announced was followed by reversal upon reversal of judgments in the inferior courts, the <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>judges of which, as in duty hound, had conformed to the doctrine of Steele <em>v. </em>The Phoenix Insurance Company; and even after the publication, in its regular order, of Post <em>v. </em>Avery, from a misapprehension of its true import, or because the Supreme Court subsequently determined to enlarge the sphere of that decision beyond the limits which the guarded language of the Chief Justice plainly expressed, or from the want of congruity in -the succeeding judgments of the Supreme Court itself, the rulings of the courts below upon questions of evidence supposed to fall within the principle of Post <em>v. </em>Avery, were, ever and anon, pronounced erroneous.

The witness was objected to on the authority of Post <em>v. Avery, </em>and the cases which followed it as a precedent, and the objection.was sustained.

Knapp, the defendant, was not a party nor in any way connected with the <a id="p456" href="#p456" data-label="456" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*456</a>original contract. It was on the subsequent agreement, the oral one of 1844, as appears by the declaration and the offered evidence, that the defendant’s liability was supposed to arise. The time when this was made was of vital importance, since the statute of limitations was pleaded, and yet it was not contained in the written instrument. The declaration and the evidence offered stated the time to have been 1844. But this date was known to Ransom only. In fact, the name of the defendant was the only part of the second and essential agreement which was in writing. Whatever force, therefore, may be attributed to the alleged grounds of Post <em>v. </em>Avery, existed in Bailey <em>v. </em>Knapp; and it is accordingly, in the opinion of the court, put upon the doctrine of <em>stare decisis, </em>as before stated.</p>

Had it been, it would have been a step in the wrong direction. The results of experience have been such that courts have been constrained, as far as possible, to regard objections as affecting the credibility rather than the competency of witnesses. Indeed, it seems not to have been contemplated, when Post <em>v. </em>Avery was decided, that thereby the general rule, established in Steele <em>v. </em>The Phoenix Insurance Company, was unsettled.. All that was designed was a qualification. The consequences of the decision were not foreseen, but, like the letting out of water, that which was a streamlet at first, soon became a flood, until in McClelland <em>v. </em>Mahon, 1 <em>Barr </em>364, the rule was entirely <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>swept away. Numerous other decisions followed, perhaps not all entirely accordant with each other. They profess, however, to aim only at a return to the common law rule, not to introduce new reasons for excluding a witness, or to recognise objections to competency which were unknown to the common law. It is ■not to be doubted, that in England, even without her recent legislation, and in our sister states, Tilden would be held to have been a competent witness. He was not a party to the suit, and he had no interest in it; he had passed the note to the plaintiff, it is true, but his name did not appear upon it; he had passed it by delivery, not endorsement. Nor was the plaintiff compelled to make title through. Tilden, as was the fact in the cases generally which have followed Post <em>v. </em>Avery. His right to sue was complete, as endorsee of the payee. ■ Unless, therefore, in departing from Steele <em>v. </em>The Phoenix Insurance Company, we have drifted in the opposite direction far beyond the doctrine of the common law, the testimony of Tilden was properly received. "We do not propose to review the cases adjudicated since Post <em>v. </em>Avery. It may suffice to'observe, that most of them have in view common law contracts. None of them have ruled that an endorser of a promissory noté'’(being released) is not a competent witness for the endorsee, in a suit against the maker, except Hatz <em>v. </em>Snyder, 2 <em>Casey </em>511. Bailey <em>v. </em>Knapp is sometimes supposed to be another, but erroneously. There the witness was excluded, but the contract upon which suit was brought, was not, in fact, a promissory note. ■ It was rather an oral agreement alleged to have been made by the defendant with the witness. Without his testimony there was not even a <em>primd facie </em>case. He was, therefore, held to be incompetent under the ruling in Post <em>v. </em>Avery, and he would have been incompetent at common law.</p>
    <p id="b458-6" data-blocks='[["BL_458.4",458,[316,1677,1141,212]]]'>Between parties to promissory notes or other negotiable instruments, and parties to other contracts, the law always made a wide distinction. The assignee of the former may bring suit in his own name; not so with the assignee of the latter. He must use the name of the legal party, and the law recognises no other.</p>
    <p id="b458-7" data-blocks='[["BL_458.5",458,[313,1889,1145,385]]]'>Hatz <em>v. </em>Snyder, it must be conceded, did decide that the payee of a promissory note was, even after release, incompetent to testify for his endorsee, in a suit against the maker. Yet even that case did not go to the great length of ruling that one who never was a party to a note, who never endorsed,-but simply transferred it by delivery, is to be excluded. Nor can we so hold without introducing new rules of evidence more stringent than any the common law ever adopted. The witness was, therefore, properly permitted to testify.</p>

And even without Tilden’s testimony, it could not have availed the defendant. It could not avail to prove that the note upon which the suit was founded was anything other than a business note, such as the law presumed it to be.' Nor do we discover in the case evidence of any fraud to affect the holder of the note, or of anything which interposed an obstacle in the way of his recovery.</p>
