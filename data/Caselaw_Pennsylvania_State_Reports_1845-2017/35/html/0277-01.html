He takes from the party, owner of such goods, a receipt, of which a copy is hereto annexed, marked “A.,” and delivers to the owner a ticket, a copy of which is hereto annexed, marked “ B.” If the advance and commission are not repaid before the time specified in the receipt, the goods are sold at public auction, and the excess, if any over the advance, expenses, and commissions, is paid to the former owner of the goods who received the advance. In case the advance and commissions are repaid to the defendant, on or before the day specified in the receipt, or before the sale, the goods are returned to the owner.</p>

That of an auctioneer is to sell by public outcry, the property of others, upon an agreement, expressed or implied, that he shall receive for his labor and skill a just compensation. The business of a pawnbroker consists in the lending of money on interest. The repayment of the loan and the payment of the interest are secured by an adequate pledge of goods on the part of the borrower to the lender. Under our laws, not more than six per cent, interest can be exacted. But a charge is allowed for the memorandum or certificate, which the pawnbroker furnishes to each borrower, stating the sum of money lent — what article has been pawned — and several other particulars. This memorandum or certificate is to be renewed at short intervals, and for each renewal a fresh charge is allowed. It is unnecessary to give a more minute description of these pursuits. Both are regulated by statutes and ordinances. Neither can be followed without a special license. The license of the auctioneer is granted <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>by the Commonwealth, that of the pawnbroker is derived from the mayor of the city. An official bond is required to be given on the part of the auctioneer to the Commonwealth — on the part of the pawnbroker, to the city corporation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b279-6" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[179,552,1156,421]]]'>“ The defendant has obtained from the Commonwealth a proper license to conduct the business of an auctioneer. But he has no license from the city to act as a pawnbroker. It is manifest, howéver, from the case stated, that he has been following the ordinary business of a pawnbroker. His license as auctioneer does not justify him in this. The two businesses may, in the absence of any statute rendering them incompatible, be carried on by the same individual at the same time. But a license for each is an essential prerequisite. Judgment is to be entered for the plaintiff.”</p>

It is admitted, that Hunt was an- auctioneer, and he seems to have added also the business of a pawnbroker. Under the 8th section of the city ordinance, it is made the duty of pawnbrokers to sell unredeemed pledges at “public auction;” and in Brande’s Encyclopedia of Science, Literature, and Art, a power of sale enters into and forms part of the definition of a pawnbroker. That Hunt sold goods at auction does not therefore disprove him a pawnbroker, while the fact that he advanced moneys on a pledge of goods fixes him as such.</p>
