Sites, deceased, against Edmund Steelman, on a check for $225, dated the 14th April 1858, drawn by the defendant, on the Manufacturers’ and Mechanics’ Bank, to the order of the plaintiffs’ testator.</p>

In that action, the defendant put in an affidavit of defence, as to the check for $225 only; whereupon the plaintiffs withdrew the copy of that check, and took judgment on the $200 check, to which there was no defence.</p>

The court declined so to charge, to which the defendant excepted; and a verdict and judgment having been rendered for the plaintiffs, he removed the cause to this court, and here assigned the same for error.</p>
