Does the mortgagee’s electing to proceed upon the bond materially alter the rights of the parties ? ‘ When the mortgaged premises were levied upon, by the <em>fieri facias, </em>it was an election of the mortgagee to proceed <em>in rem, </em>against the pledge, and a sale upon the <em>venditioni, </em>was as much a, sale of the pledge, out and' out, as if it had been upon the<em>levari facias. </em>It is no objection with me, that the party has elected his remedy. It is not a case of election of alternate remedies ; the remedies are cumulative, concurrent, may be all carried on together, though there can be but one satisfaction. The mortgagee has three remedies, debt upon his bond, ejectment, and <em>scire facias </em>on the mortgage, all provided at the same time, if he so choose:’ McCall <em>v. </em>Lenox, 9 <em>S. ‡ R. </em>314.</p>

If so, does it not necessarily follow, that he has his lien upon the proceeds of the mortgaged premises ? The money in court stands in the place of the land; ‘ as has already been intimated, it flows from the fact, that the bond and mortgage are but accumulative securities for the same debt, and the use of either, for the purpose of collecting it from the land pledged, must be unavoidably attended with the same legal consequences:’ Clarke <em>¶. </em>Stanley, 10 <em>Barr </em>480.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b210-8" data-blocks='[["BL_210.5",210,[321,1148,1157,642]]]'>44 The literal construction of the Act of 1849 — that the defendant is entitled to his exemption of three hundred dollars, when the land is sold upon á <em>venditioni exponas, </em>is attempted to be sustained by an argument, which, while adhering to the letter, ignores the spirit and purpose of the' law. It is to the fact of a man’s property being sold, and to prevent absolute poverty, that the law looks, and not the name of the writ which commands the sale. Many cases could be mentioned, where-a defendant has no right to exemption, where the land is sold upon a <em>venditioni ■exponas. </em>Thus, where land is sold for arrears of ground-rent, the ground-rent will be paid rather than the defendant’s claim of exemption. Again, if the argument for a literal construction he sound, when land is sold by a <em>fieri facias </em>or a <em>levari facias, </em>the ■defendant has no right to his three hundred dollar exemption, because the Act of Assembly speaks only of <em>venditioni exponas.</em>

      <em>“ </em>It is not questioned that the sale upon the bond in this case, which was effected by a <em>venditioni exponas, </em>divested the lien of the mortgage, yet the Act of 1830 says, 4 The lien of such mortgage should not be destroyed, or in any way affected by <em>any sale </em>made by virtue or authority of any writ of <em>venditioni exponas.’ </em>Argument, however, is superfluous, as Pierce <em>v. </em>Potter, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20478" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="7 Watts 478">7 <em>Watts </em>478</a>, Berger <em>v. </em>Hiester, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Whart.%20214" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Whart. 214">6 <em>Whart. </em>214</a>, and many other cases that could be mentioned, are directly to the point of the legislative meaning of the words 4 <em>venditioni exponas,’ </em>and impress upon them a judicial import, entirely consistent with the foregoing views.” -</p>

Had the proceeding been under the mortgage, it is clear he would not. But the title of the vendee at the sheriff’s sale is still fortified by the plaintiff’s mortgage. He purchased and paid for, not merely the equity of redemption subject to the mortgage, but he bought the mortgage itself. The mortgagee, by proceeding on his bond, could not sell subject to the lien of his mortgage; it follows then, that the adoption of the one or other remedy ought not to vary, and does not vary the relative rights of the party. We agree with the auditor that the principle of McCall <em>v. </em>Lenox, 9 <em>8. R. </em>302, settles this case.”</p>
