      <em>S. D. Ball, JEsq., sworn. </em>— “I drew the articles of agreement for the parties, and drew them as I understood the agreement to be; it was rather hastily drawn; just before the agreement was signed, Mr. Williams spoke, of the agreement with regard to the fifty and twenty-five cents; he said his understanding was, that they were only to pay if they mined the coal; I think Mr. Odgers objected to that understanding; they talked over the matter, and it was finally agreed that there was no difficulty in mining that quantity of coal; Mr. Odgers finally said he would take the risk, that they would mine that quantity of coal; they were very anxious to have the colliery; it was thought to be a bargain; they refused to sign if they were bound to mine the coal; Mr. Odgers, as I understood it, took the risk upon himself. There was something said like <em>this, </em>— 1 how will it be, if you don’t mine the coal ? then, of course, you won’t get the money.’ Mr. Odgers finally agreed to take the risk.”</p>

      <em>Cross-examined. </em>— “ It seemed to be taken for granted that there was sufficient coal there; I don’t remember the words that Williams used; he was particularly anxious that the agreement should show that the price was to be paid out of the coal as <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>mined; I don’t know that I made up my mind as to the exact extent of the risk that Odgers assumed; I had no idea in my mind that they would abandon it, except for want of eoal; there was something said about cash purchasers that1 Odgers had from Reading; I was at the colliery; don’t know whether they got the personal property; think there was some complaint about a portion of the property, not much in amount; I don’t remember the exact conversation that took place at the time of executing the agreement; there was a large sum of money misappropriated by one of the parties, say $1000, which operated to destroy their confidence in each other; I think they recovered the money; I think they went ■ out after that; I was counsel for Mr. Chalfant, and issued the attachment execution; I had several conversations with the parties, and, by arrangement, it was agreed that Chalfant should get his judgment against Odgers, and issue the attachment; all parties were willing that Chalfant should have the money that was coming to Odgers; at the time the judgment and attachment execution were issued, they were going all right, and it looked as if the money would be paid; I had several conversations with them; proposed their acceptance of an order; Mr. Odgers said he would take the risk that they would mine the necessary amount of coal; they objected to sign the agreement if they were absolutely bound to mine the coal; they were willing to pay as they mined the coal according to the agreement; Mr. Odgers agreed to take the risk that they would mine the coal; my understanding was, that if any accident happened, so that they could not mine the coal, they were not to pay; they objected to signing if they were bound to mine the coal; it was to be at their option; there was something said about re-writing the agreement, but they said it was not necessary; that they understood it, and it would be all right.”</p>

We permit a deed absolute on its face to be proved a mortgage; we receive parol evidence to rebut a presumption or an equity — to supply deficiencies in the written agreement — to explain ambiguities in the subject-matter of writings — to prevent frauds, and to correct mistakes: Bank <em>v. </em>Fordyce, 9 <em>Barr </em>279; Rearich <em>v. </em>Swinehart, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20238" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Jones 238">1 <em>Jones </em>238</a>; Barnhart <em>v. </em>Riddle, 5 <em>Casey </em>96; Musselman <em>v. </em>Stoner, 7 <em>Casey </em>270.</p>
