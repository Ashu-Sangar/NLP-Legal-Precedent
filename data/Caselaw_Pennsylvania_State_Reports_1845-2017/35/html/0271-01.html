The purpose of both acts was the same. It was to substitute a popular vote for the discretion of the Court of Quarter Sessions, after a return of commissioners favourable to the division of a township, or to the erection of a new one. The <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>language of the acts is almost identical, and probably the second was passed only because the provisions of the first were supposed not to be large enough to embrace the case of a new township.</p>
    <p id="b272-5" data-blocks='[["BL_272.4",272,[336,538,1153,689]]]'>The court below were therefore in error in adjudging, as they did, that the proceedings subsequent to the report of the commissioners, and confirmation thereof <em>nisi, </em>must conform to and follow the provisions of the Act of April 24th 1847. Doubtless the adjudication would not have been made, had the case in 7 <em>Oasey </em>been reported at the time. The proceeding for the new township having originated previous to the Act of 1857, and a report having been made and confirmed <em>nisi, </em>before that act was passed, it is unaffected by the act. It is not within the reach of a'popular vote, but is wholly subject to the discretion of the court. The petitioners are entitled to the exercise of that discretion. Had it been exercised, the matter would not be reviewable here, but the record shows that it was not. Instead of it, the court adjudged that the proceedings must conform to the provisions of the Act of 24th April 1857. We think that adjudication wras erroneous, and as it terminated the proceedings, it must be reversed.</p>
