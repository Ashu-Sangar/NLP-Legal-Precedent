Coolbaugh and George Coolbaugh, his son, at a gate on the land of the elder defendant, across which a right of way claimed by William Morley was in dispute; and were violently assaulted by the defendants; Ranson W. Coolbaugh striking and choking William Morley, and his son throwing stones, by means of which the plaintiff was severely injured.</p>

Coolbaugh the father, and he was examined as a witness for his son, the other co-defendant. 'To this action of the court, the counsel for the plaintiff excepted, and the question is, whether, upon the evidence, this was a proper exercise of judicial discretion, which should be “ regulated, not merely by the fact that at the close of the plaintiff’s case <em>no evidence </em>appears to affect him, but by the probabilities whether any such will arise before the whole evidence in the cause closes.”</p>
