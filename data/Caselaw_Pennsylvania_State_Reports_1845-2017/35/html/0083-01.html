His interest is equal either way; or if there is any preponderance, it is in favour of the execution-creditor, who has a judgment ripe and ready for any proceeding against him, whilst the landlord has only his claim on the contract — on which, to be sure, he has the right to distrain, but only <em>sub modo, </em>and under certain very strict limitations. The possi<a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>bility that the landlord and tenant may collude to defraud an execution-creditor, may, in a given case, affect the credit of the witness; but does not come up to the reasons on which, on grounds of public policy, a witness having no interest is excluded. The same principle would exclude a defendant, in a contest between rival creditors, contesting the right to the proceeds of his property in court for distribution after a judicial sale; and yet it has never been doubted that, in such a case, he is a competent witness.</p>

He took possession without paying the first six months’ rent, he being disabled from doing so by misfortunes, which he states. Some of his goods had been moved on the premises before the 1st of April. A few days after he took possession, he told the landlord that he was not able to pay the rent in advance, unless he could get his friends to help him. It does not appear what reply Mr. Kirkner made, nor if he made any. It is claimed, but with very little show of plausibility, as it seems to me, that this amounted to a rescission of the first bargain, and created a new one between the parties, such as the law would imply. But there is no proof of this. Then, is it such a waiver of his right to claim performance, by the landlord, as would prevent him from distraining afterwards, or from claiming the rent out of the proceeds of an execution ? Can a creditor, whether landlord or not, only grant indulgence to a distressed debtor, and listen to the humane instincts and pleadings of his heart, at the risk of losing his debt, annulling his contract, or being deprived of his legal remedies to enforce it ? Surely this cannot be so where he does not bind his hands by any new engagement.</p>

      <em>“ </em>That he is, is settled clearly enough by Anderson’s Appeal, <em>3 Barr </em>218, unless it has been since overruled. To show that it has, Martin’s Appeal, 5 <em>W. $ 8. </em>220, is cited, not, indeed, as overruling it, for it was decided prior, but as being inconsistent with it, and as indicating a general current of judicial opinion against it. That case is, however, not in point, even for that purpose, inasmuch as the claim there was for rent out of .the proceeds of the execution, which had been reserved, payable in <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>advance, on another lease not yet commenced. In the case before us, the lease had commenced, and the tenant had been in possession under it nearly two months. Neither is Anderson’s Appeal overruled by Purdy’s Appeal, 11 <em>Harris </em>97; on the contrary, the Supreme Court, while reversing the action of the court below, on the ground (correctly assumed), that that case had been misapplied and extended too far directly, or at least by necessary implication, admit it to be law in similar cases. The error committed by the court below, in Purdy’s Appeal, is stated to have lain in giving the landlord an apportioned share on the quarter’s rent, which, according to the contract of the parties, was not due at the time of the seizure and sale of the tenant’s goods.</p>

But whatever, in the absence of express stipulation, may be the rule of law as to enjoyment constituting the basis and consideration of the right to distrain, surely the parties may make the rent due before enjoyment; and then the right to distrain for rent due, according to all our decisions, follows. The truth is, the rule at law is misstated in the argument. Rent is, at law, due only after enjoyment; and then the right of distress follows because it is due, not because the premises have been enjoyed.</p>

The term, with the possession thereof, became vested in the plaintiff, and the reversion alone remained in the defendant; and hence, as soon thereafter as by the terms of the lease, the rent, or any portion thereof, became payable on a certain day, and remained unpaid until the day following, the defendant had a right to resort to the remedy of distress for the recovery thereof.’ And at the close of the opinion he gives the reason, or otherwise the lessor would <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>be in the predicament of having a right without a remedy; which, he adds, <em>‘ </em>cannot be.’</p>

The learned judge (Bell), who delivered the opinion of the court, it is true, refers to the opinions of other judges, and adds his own, disapprobatory of the doctrine established in West <em>v. </em>Sink, and points out its real or supposed mischiefs, and makes that the ground of the refusal of the court to extend the doctrine of apportionment of rent to the case of debts provable in bankruptcy, or indeed to any other cases not covered already by that and kindred decisions.
