      <em>“ </em>Although the words of this last clause are general, it has been argued that in reason it only applies to the case next immediately preceding, where the estate is divided into fewer parts than there are heirs. The reason for so restricting the interpretation is, that where the shares are equal and the widow’s third equally charged upon her death, it is most natural and equitable to consider it as extinguished. And so practically it is, whenever the original heirs continue to own their respective parts at the death of the widow, as the claim of each is counterbalanced by the claim of the other upon him. Still it is important to observe that there is no absolute merger. ‘ Whatever doubt,’ says the Supreme Court, in Kurtz’s Appeal, 2 <em>Casey </em>465, ‘ there may be as to the nature of the widow’s estate, it is certain, that so far as relates to the principal sum, it is simply a charge upon the land in the nature of a lien, payable at the widow’s death to the heirs of the intestate, to be recovered as personal only.’</p>

The assignee of each <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>part takes subject to the payment of the principal sum charged upon that part at the death of the widow, but he does not acquire by the grant of his allotment the right of his grantor to a share of the principal sum charged upon the other allotments. He has no claim upon the other heirs to set-off. And practically it all comes right; for as the heir who has sold his land, subject to the charge, is no longer personally liable for it, his claim upon the co-heirs can no longer be answered by their set-off. They must recover of the assignee to place them where they would have been if no assignee had intervened.</p>

Whether it would be so in case of a deed or mortgage expressly subject to the payment of the whole principal sum upon the death of the widow, is a question which does not arise in this case, and therefore we express no opinion upon it.

The Act of 11th April 1799 is quite clear in conveying this thought, for it declares that such heir shall take subject to a lien thereon in favour of the <em>other </em>parties for their shares, and it has been so applied in practice : <a href="/whart/2/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Whart. 240" data-case-ids="1830491" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0240-01">2 <em>Whart. </em>240</a>. Looking at this principle carefully, it will be seen that, where the partition is equal among the heirs, each has his full share of all the land, subject only to his share of the widow’s thirds, and then she is the only <em>other party </em>to be secured, and the only lien is one in her favour.</p>
    <p id="b516-12" data-blocks='[["BL_516.13",516,[349,2159,1151,260]],["BL_517.1",517,[118,394,1159,557]]]'>And we think that the partition law of 7th April 1807 adopts no different principle for cases where the partition among the heirs is equal. It makes the principal of one-third of the valuations a charge; but this is only for the purpose of securing the widow her thirds, and not to secure to each heir what he already has; for the law is not to be read as requiring vain things. Even when <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>partition is unequal, the lien has not been understood as securing the taker’s share of the reserved third of the valuation; for he is regarded as having it: 2 <em>Penn. R. </em>340; <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Whart.%20542" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Whart. 542">5 <em>Whart. </em>542</a>; 1 <em>Barr </em>118. Without a special agreement to the contrary, therefore, an heir who has thus taken land in partition and conveyed it away, has no lien or right on account of the third reserved for the widow; and when the partition is equal, and each has an equal share of the widow’s thirds to pay, no one has any claim upon another for any part of the reserved thirds on the death of the widow. The clause of the Act of 7th April 1807, § 6, that provides for a distribution of this sum among the heirs, on the death of the widow, does not apply to cases of completed equal partitions of the land, for that distribution is already made.</p>
