At the same date, Yeomans executed to Rexford a mortgage upon lands in Tioga county, Pennsylvania, to secure the payment of the respective sums for which said notes were given. A <em>scire facias </em>issued upon this mortgage, and a judgment was obtained on it, on the 18th day of December 1852, for $3897, being the principal of the debt, and six per cent, interest. This judgment was satisfied by payment, as per entry of satisfaction on the record, on the 8th of April 1854. The present suit is brought to recover-one per cent, (the difference between New York and Pennsylvania, interest) on $3100, from the 30th of October 1848, to the 8th of April 1854, and interest on the same from that date. The defendant alleges that by the recovery upon the mortgage, and satisfaction thereon, the notes accompanying and recited in it, were satisfied and extinguished. The court are of opinion that the notes are the primary evidence of and security for the indebtedness — and that the mortgage was collateral thereto — that, payment upon the mortgage satisfied <em>pro tanto </em>the notes, and no farther — that Rexford, by the terms of his contract with. Yeomans, was entitled to the $3100, and interest from the 30th. October 1848, at thé. rate of seven per cent, per annum — that upon the mortgage he recovered but six per cent., and is therefore entitled to the additional one per cent, in this suit, brought, upon the notes, which have never been given up or cancelled, and are not satisfied by the recovery on the mortgage, except to the-extent of the amount recovered and received. ' The jury are, <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>therefore, instructed to render a verdict in favour of plaintiff for the amount claimed by him in this suit — being one per cent, on $3100, from the 30th of October 1848 to the 8th of April 1854, .(at which time payment was made on the judgment or the mortgage), and on the amount then due from that date to the date of their verdict.”</p>

They were given and dated in the city of New York, and were payable at the Bank of Commerce in that city. At the same time, the defendant, to secure the payment of these notes, gave the plaintiff a purchase-money mortgage upon the land in Tioga.</p>

Judgment was entered for the principal and interest, and after execution the plaintiff entered satisfaction on it, by receipting in full for debt, interest, and costs. This extinguished the mortgage, and with it the debt it was given to secure; for the security of the mortgage was co-extensive with the notes <em>[Story’s Conflict of Laws, </em>§ 293), and the payment of either was the payment of both.</p>
