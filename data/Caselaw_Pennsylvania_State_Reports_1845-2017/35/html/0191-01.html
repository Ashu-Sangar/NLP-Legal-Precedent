The evidence of plaintiff shows that Speadzer occupied this house for two years — from 1824 to 1826.

It is not the validity of the respective titles of the parties that is the subject of controversy. We may assume, either would be good in the absence of the other; but when they come in conflict, which shall prevail ? If one party, by negligence, has permitted another to acquire a title perfectly good upon its face, without affording him the means of notice of a superior title, such neglect, by reason of the injury which would be inflicted upon the purchaser, will enable him to recover against a title which would have been conclusive against his grantors. Thus a second purchaser will prevail against an older and better title held by unrecorded deed, and this by reason of the neglect to give notice, such as the law requires of the older title. But possession by the first purchaser, is notice when the deed is not recorded. A purchaser who holds by deed, has two ways of protecting his title — by possession or recording his deed. A claimant under the statute has but one mode of giving notice — that of possession. He has no deed to record; but because he has but one mode and not two, as the purchaser by deed has, is he to be excused from giving notice by continued possession, and to be permitted to let an intruder enter and occupy for six or seven years, who can give no information to an inquirer who is about to purchase a title by warrant, survey, and patent ?</p>

An honest labourer builds his cabin and clears a potato patch on an appropriated tract, and claims to the extent of the survey; the land is mountainous, sterile, and unproductive, and in place of attempting to clear and cultivate a farm, and erect comfortable buildings, he wisely concludes to erect a little sawmill, and by sawing the sparsely scattered timber upon the sterile soil, which has only afforded sufficient nourishment to raise an occasional sapling to the dignity of a saw-log, he succeeds in filling the mouths and partially covering the backs of his wife and children for twenty-one years. But the timber is exhausted; the saw-mill becomes useless, and starvation is at his door. He sells his title — or the sheriff sells-it for him — for a mere trifle, to a speculator, who shrewdly conjectures there is more value under than upon the surface. The purchaser has a perfectly legal and indefeasible title, which can only be lost by adverse possession for twenty-one years, say the counsel for the defendants, and he therefore wisely determines to abandon the trouble of keeping the cabin tenanted, which is too dilapidated to be occupied and rented to keep up the possession, to be replaced by a new one. This useless expenditure he avoids hy permitting it to go to decay, which he may safely do, if the argument of defendants’ counsel is sound, that his title is perfect and cannot be impaired for twenty-one years. He lives in Pottsville or Philadelphia, and pays his taxes promptly, as most speculators are careful to do; and this, he is advised, is all that is required to protect his title from the cormorant maws of his brother speculators. Eighteen years roll around; his neighbour hears of untold millions realized by investments in Schuylkill county coal lands; a title, perfect on its face, is offered to him; although eager and anxious, he is cautious and prudent; he procures a surveyor, goes upon the ground and discovers the land; careful examination is made, to ascertain if the title which he is about to purchase has been impaired by possession. But the cabin and fences have mouldered away, the sawmill disappeared, and the cleared land is covered with timber, the growth of eighteen years. No vestige of the marks of previous occupancy can be discovered. He makes the purchase, builds his railroad, sinks his shaft, erects his engine, expends every dollar of his means upon this mine of untold wealth, and just as he is about to realize a return for his expenditures, his neighbour brings an ejectment upon the title of the former occupant, long since obliterated from notice, and must necessarily recover, if the posi<a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>tion assumed <em>by </em>defendants’ counsel is tenable; that a title once acquired under the statute can only be defeated by twenty-one years’ adverse possession. These illustrations we think sufficient to dispose of the argument attempted to be drawn from the hardship of extreme cases on either side. If established and known legal principles are to be modified to meet extreme eases, it is time enough to commence the dangerous work when cases arise requiring such remedy. We . do not consider the present case requires a departure from or modification of settled rules of property. Both parties doubtless purchased honestly, believing they obtained good title, and we are willing to place them in a' position in which they have placed each other — of speculators buying a very valuable tract of coal land for a very small consideration. Neither party has contributed by labour or expenditures, to increase its value. Their merits are equal, and the land must be given to the party to whom the law gives the better title.

The defendant claimed under an unrecorded deed from Jane Vanschuyver. The plaintiff under a deed from the heirs at law of the defendant’s grantor. The land was occupied for many years by those claiming-under the unrecorded deed. The Vanschuyvérs had not been in possession from 1821 till their conveyance to Wood, the plaintiff, in 1847, a period of twenty-six years. The administrators of Wright, who held under the unrecorded deed, sold to Osmond by order of the Orphans’ Court, which was confirmed in March 1838. Osmond took possession 1st April 1838, paid $1000, and continued in possession until 31st March 1842. <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>In consequence of some difficulty between Osmond’s and Wright’s administrators, Osmond refused to comply with his contract, and removed from the- premises. On the 1st April 1842, Iléllings took possession, without. leave from any one, as an intruder, and remained till March 1847. The heirs of Jane Vanschuyver conveyed to Wood, in December 1846 and January 1847, and upon this conveyance Wood recovered against those claiming under the unrecorded deed, and possessing under it.for twenty-six years. It- appeared, also, that Hellings, the intruder, before he took possession, applied to the administrators of Wright for permission to do so, and was referred hy them to Osmond. From this the inference would he irresistible, that Hellings had»a knowledge of the difficulty between Wright’s administrators and Osmond, the purchaser, and that proper inquiry by Wood of Helllings, the occupant, would have developed a,full knowledge of the title under the unrecorded deed. But, in answer to this, the court say: ‘The possession of one, either in person or by his tenant, is notice of his unrecorded title; but the possession of an intruder cannot he held to be notice of the title of a stranger. The evidence was clear that the possession of Hellings had no connection whatever with the title under which defendant claimed. It is barely possible that an inquiry of Hellings would have elicited some information in regard to the claim of Wright. A mere possibility will not suffice to obviate a difficulty occasioned by the neglect to comply with the recording acts.’</p>

A purchaser is not required to make inquiry of the occupant, but then he purchases at his peril, and takes it with notice of the title under which the occupant holds.' If he holds under an unrecorded deed, the purchaser is affected with notice. If the occupant enters and holds as an intruder, the purchaser takes a title, paramount to any title of which he has no means of obtaining notice. If we are correct, the defendants cannot complain. The instruction to the jury was more favourable to them then the law justified, in submitting whether the plaintiffs or defendants were more culpable, — the former in not making further inquiry, or the latter, in permitting an intruder to occupy, for six or seven years, when possession was the only notice of title they could give. Suavely did more than the law required, in inquiring of Daubert, the occupant, how he held the premises. He would, under the circumstances, have been protected without any such inquiry. Col. Cake and others, in their purchase from Snavely, in September 1838, are also purchasers without notice, for Daubert was still in possession as an intruder, and took a lease from Col. Cake in the fall of’1839. If notice of title is required <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>when it can he given, the law and the weight of evidence is with the plaintiffs. And why a title under the statute of limitations should not require possession to protect it equally with an unrecorded deed, we can discover no reason. Suppose an unregistered deed is lost or destroyed, can it he that, because the claimant has but one way of giving notice, and not two, he will be excused from taking and continuing possession to protect his title from subsequent purchasers ? • The law abhors secret trusts and titles, and will not sustain them to the prejudice of the innocent, who would thereby be subjected to loss by the negligence of a party who has omitted to give such notice as the nature of his title will permit.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="A_7" data-blocks='[["BL_202.4",202,[327,845,1155,1026]]]'>“ Should it be contended, that this case is different from the cases cited of a subsequent purchaser against a prior unrecorded deed, when both claim through the same title, because in the present case, the parties'claim through separate and distinct titles, the answer is that such distinction does not exist. To acquire title under the statute, title must he shown out of the Commonwealth. Without showing title in some one, the defendants have no case. But title is shown in John Lesher, the warrantee, by warrant and survey and patent to Ludwig Schwartz, the vendee of Lesher, in 1803. Both parties therefore necessarily claim through Lesher and Schwartz. If the defendants claimed by unrecorded deed from Lesher or Schwartz, the subsequent deed to Snavely must defeat their title. Why, if the law requires them to keep up notice of a title by deed, shall they be permitted to abandon their .evidence of title by possession, the moment such title is required ? A purchaser cannot put his deed in his desk and remain passive for twenty-one years, and protect his title by the payment of taxes alone. And we can recur to no principle of' law or equity, that permits all notice of title to be obliterated and abandoned, and then such title to be reasserted at the expiration of any period short of twenty-one years, against a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser for value, without notice, or the means of obtaining it. For the reasons stated, we think the verdict is in accordance with the law and evidence of the case, and we will not disturb it.</p>

The plaintiffs showed a perfect paper title to the land in controversy, from John Lesher, the original warrantee of the Commonwealth. Deriving their title through Schwartz and Snavely, they showed that when the latter purchased there was no- inconsistent title on record, and no possession to give notice of an adverse right. Daubert, who was on the ground at the time, was a mere intruder, and claimed under neither title that is in question here. The plaintiffs claimed, therefore, to be <em>bond fide </em>purchasers, without notice of the title of the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b203-9" data-blocks='[["BL_203.10",203,[149,1593,1157,601]]]'>The defendants claimed under the statute of limitations. They showed a possession commenced in 1805, and continued down to about 1833, when the tenants of the then owners deserted the premises, and George Daubert entered as an intruder. This title, transferred several times, and twice by public sales, was duly vested in the defendants. As the case is presented on the record, we are obliged to. consider every fact necessary to complete a title under the statute, so proved, that the jury would have found it had it been submitted. In other words, we assume that the plaintiffs have a perfect paper title, and the defendants a perfect title under the statute of limitations — but that when Snavely bought the title under which the plaintiffs claim, the defendants had lost the possession, though the statutory period of twenty-one years had run out in favour of their right‘long before.</p>

However expedient it might be to require some public record of such titles to be kept, and however inconvenient it may be to purchasers to ascertain what titles of that sort are outstanding, still we have not as yet any legislation on the subject, and it is not competent for judicial decision to force upon them consequences drawn from the recording acts.

Whatever merit that title possessed, by reason of being on record, must' be regarded as belonging to the defendants. In a word, whatever title was outstanding from the Commonwealth to this land, they had acquired, and had acquired it, too, under a statute which gave them no facilities, and laid upon them no obligation to make a record of it.

Un<a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>doubtedly. Yet how can the title of the defendants be regarded as secret ? It had come down through two public sales that were on record, and it was proclaimed by whatever marks on the ground a possession of nearly thirty years had left there. There were, .besides, the traditions of the neighbourhood, anciently the only legal evidence of transfers of land, to guide a diligent inquirer to the truth. If these were insufficient circumstances to affect a purchaser with notice, then it must be remembered, that a title under the statute cannot be spread upon the registry of deeds. The law has created the title, but has provided no way for recording it. Shall the law, for that reason, destroy it? This would be to charge the law with folly.</p>

And if they would be relieved of this necessity, they must get the legislature to contrive a mode of putting this kind of title on the public records. ’Till that is done, the courts will be obliged to give effect to such titles without regard to records.</p>

The defendants’ title having matured long before. the plaintiffs purchased theirs, the defendants were under no more obligation to keep up the possession than any other owner is to occupy what he owns.</p>
