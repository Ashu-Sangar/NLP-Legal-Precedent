He went home (to Covington, in the samo county) to get his sureties, and a paper was executed by the defendants under their several seals, authorizing him \u201c to place our names to a contract, &c., as security for the performance of said contract on his part.\u201d He signed and sealed the contract for them as his sureties, and the action is in covenant; and it is objected, that he had no authority to seal. We think, however, that he had. The authority is under seal, and that is some evidence of it. A warrant of attorney under seal, for the present execution of a contract not under seal, is a simple waste of legal solemnities, that could hardly be intended. The authority is to place the defendants\u2019 names to the contract; but this does not affect the completeness of the power invested by the warrant under seal, for that is only a form of expression of the authority to execute the instrument on their behalf. It is full power to execute it, as they could have done, if present.\nThe other point is without error.\nJudgment reversed, and a new trial awarded.",

    "head_matter": "Wickham et al. versus Knox et al.\nA power of attorney, under seal, authorizing the attorney to place his principals' names to a contract, empowers him to execute a contract under seal.\nError to the Common Pleas of Tioga county.\nThis was an action of covenant by Benjamin C. Wickham, Joseph Aiken, Abram Prutsman, and John B. Steele, who survived Peter B. Guernsey, against J. 0. Johnson, Charles D. Birchard, Lucy Putnam, and George Knox, on a contract, under seal, wherebythe defendants guarantied the performance of a contract by George W. Booth, to erect a meeting-house for the plaintiffs, who were the building committee of the Presbyterian Church in Tioga village.\nIn August 1850, the plaintiffs advertised for proposals for building a meeting-house in Tioga village, requiring the contractors to give security for the performance of their contract. George W. Booth sent in a proposal, which was accepted; and the defendants executed the following power of attorney, authorizing him to place their names, as guarantors, to the building contract:\u2014\nCovington, Aug,. 5th, A. d. 1850.\nMessrs.

To this the plaintiffs excepted; and a verdict and judgment having been rendered for the defendants, the plaintiffs sued out this writ, and here assigned the same, inter alia, for error.\nCfuernsey and PI.
