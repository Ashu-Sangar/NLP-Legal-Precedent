But the postulate of this conclusion we do not discuss; for we prefer going on the equitable principles involved in the cause.</p>

He devised it without this, and thus left his will subject to be partially defeated by Thomas, the heir in tail.

To what extent ? Of course only to the extent of his legal estate; that is, according to the assumption with which we started, for his life. But the remainder was in his children, and if they also were bound to elect, then they are trustees also for the equitable owners.</p>

When their father died seised in fee simple of the very land elected by him in repudiation of the will, and it descended to them; they were exactly in the position that their father had occupied when he was compelled to elect: they had the legal title to both tracts, one intended by the will for themselves, and the other for their uncles. They cannot have both, and of course they must elect. They have elected to keep the Buckingham farm, and have therefore no equitable claim to the other.
