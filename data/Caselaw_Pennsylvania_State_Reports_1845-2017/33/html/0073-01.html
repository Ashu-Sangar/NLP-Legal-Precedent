It was occasionally raised, and the pool deepened, but in consequence of the difficulty in maintaining the requisite depth of water, arising from the deposits of coal dirt, &amp;c., swept into it from the collieries above, the defendants, in 1852-3, ceased to use the landings in that pool, and supplied their place by new landings, erected below the dam. The dam, however, was retained; its existence being deemed essential to the maintenance of the navigation immediately below.

To recover damages for this injury, he has brought this suit.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b74-7" data-blocks='[["BL_74.8",74,[302,980,1168,943]]]'>“ The company defendant was incorporated by the Act of 8th of March 1815, and was authorized to make a slack-water navigation of the Schuylkill river, from the city of Philadelphia to the mouth of Mill creek in the county of Schuylkill. The powers granted to the company are very extensive, and among them is the right to erect dams and locks in the river. The purpose for which these powers were granted, was ‘ to make a complete slack-water navigation’ between the points named, ‘ so as to admit a safe and ready passage for loaded boats, arks, and other vessels up, as well as down, said river.’ This was an object of great public interest and benefit; and all the powers and privileges necessary to accomplish it, were granted to the company by the act of incorporation. They were to be used, as well for the public benefit, as the private emolument of the stockholders; but not with a wanton disregard of the rights of private property. They were authorized to take private property needful for the purposes of the company, and to erect dams and overflow the lands of adjacent riparian owners, when necessary. All the rights granted were to be exercised in subordination to, and for the accomplish- l ment of the great object the legislature had in view in granting them, and in such manner as to infringe upon private property no further than necessary.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b74-8" data-blocks='[["BL_74.9",74,[299,1923,1157,515]],["BL_75.1",75,[165,424,1168,1805]]]'>“ The dam, known as dam No. 1, was erected by the company at the borough of Port Carbon, for the purpose of rendering the river navigable above the location of the dam. They built it as high as they thought necessary for that purpose; and the damages, if any, suffered by the riparian owners from the overflow of water caused by the dam at that height were, very likely, ascertained and paid. The company had the right to raise the height of the dam, if it was necessary, to enable larger boats than those formerly used to navigate the river above the dam; but they had no right to increase the height of the dam, if the necessity for it arose from their neglect to keep the pool of the dam clear of coal dirt, sand, and debris; otherwise they might do so, from time to time, until <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>they caused the water to overflow the whole town of Port Carbon and the adjacent country. The exercise of such power by the company was never contemplated by the legislature, nor warranted by their charter. Powers and privileges are granted to, but duties and obligations are also imposed upon, the company; and by the 20th section of the original act of incorporation, they are expressly obligated ‘to remove any obstacle which may occur, so that boats, arks, rafts, or other vessels, may at all times safely navigate the said river.’ A penalty of $ 100 is imposed for any neglect of this obligation; but that will not prevent the plaintiff from recovering damages for any injury to his property, caused by such neglect. It was, then, the duty of the company, implied from the purpose for which their privileges were granted,- and directly imposed by the letter of the statute, to keep the-pool of dam No. 1 clear and free from coal-dirt, sand, gravel, and other materials, so that boats might navigate it, if that .could be done without increasing the height of the dam. It was a violation of their duty to permit the pool of the dam to fill up with coal-dirt, sand, and debris, washed into it from Mill creek and the river above, so as entirely to destroy the navigation of' the river at and above that point. The company were authorized to erect a dam to form a slack-water navigation of the river, not to create a reservoir for the reception of coal-dirt and other materials. When they ceased to use it for the former object, they could not maintain it for the latter purpose, to the injury of the property lying adjacent or along the banks of Mill creek. When the company ceased to use the dam for navigation, they were bound to take it away, if it created a public nuisance, or injured private property. The fact that the coal-dirt, which formed the larger portion of the deposit, was thrown into the streams above, or placed along their margin by the coal operators or miners, and then carried and floated by the current into the pool of the dam, will not excuse the company, or relieve them from liability for the injurious results. They might have foreseen the consequences, and prevented the miners and operators from putting coal-dirt into the stream, or so near thereto that the natural drainage or water’s shed would carry it into the streams. If, in doing so, the miners and operators created a public nuisance, and caused injury to property, they could have been compelled to stop, by an indictment or injunction, at the instance of the company; and they cannot shield themselves from responsibility by permitting their property to be destroyed, if the property of the plaintiff was thereby injured.</p>

But if the deposit in Mill creek, and the consequent injury to plaintiff’s property, arose from backing the water up the creek by the dam, at a height necessary for navigation, then the defendants would not be liable to plaintiff in this action, although they might be in another proceeding; and that, although the dam afterwards filled up and was abandoned by defendants, and this is the only other question of fact for your decision.</p>
