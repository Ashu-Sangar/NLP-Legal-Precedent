If he can avert the specific force of the former verdict, he cannot divest himself of the conditions of his case. He stands in a court of equity asking that his vendor shall be decreed to perform the agreement between them, and the prime, the paramount, the indispensable inquiry is — Have you done equity ? Who seeks equity should do equity.- You ask that the vendor’s title should be conveyed to you. Did you pay him according to the contract ? If no time was fixed for payment of the purchase-money, did you pay it, or offer to pay in a reasonable time, all circumstances considered ?</p>
    <p id="b509-10" data-blocks='[["BL_509.10",509,[200,1747,1162,386]]]'>From these questions there is no escape for a party in the posture assumed by this plaintiff. They arise out of no technical rule of law, but from the essential equities of the contract sought to be enforced. So long as bargains are made upon the principle of mutuality, that justice which is due from man to man, and from courts to all men, demands that they should be enforced on the principle of mutuality. If a purchaser will not pay as he promised, there is no justice, reason, or equity in his demand that the seller shall be compelled to perform on <em>his </em>-part.</p>
    <p id="b509-11" data-blocks='[["BL_509.11",509,[201,2132,1161,303]],["BL_510.1",510,[272,409,1162,514]]]'>Now, these observations bring us to the ground on which we ruled this case last year: 7 <em>Casey </em>404. Not only did Hean neglect to pay his purchase-money, or to assert his equities when sued by Maulfair for the possession, but he attorned to him, once and again, as tenant. The written lease of December 1853 was renewed by parol in the spring of 1854, for a year; and in April 1855, Hean was put out of possession by proceedings under the landlord and <a id="p510" href="#p510" data-label="510" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*510</a>tenant law. After the recovery in ejectment, there was proof of Maulfair’s declarations that he wanted no more from Hean than what he owed on the lot, but it was not paid or tendered until the 8th January 1856, when Wengert, who had purchased Jiean’s interest at sheriff’s sale for $35, offered to pay what was due, and the next day brought this suit. This offer was eight years after Hean’s contract of purchase — more than two years after Maul-fair’s recovery in ejectment, and Hean’s attornment to him— nearly two years after Maulfair’s conveyance to Eisher &amp; Eunck, of which Wengert had full notice before he became the purchaser of Hean’s interest — and nine months after Hean had been put out of possession, not as vendee, but as tenant of Maulfair.</p>
    <p id="b510-6" data-blocks='[["BL_510.6",510,[271,923,1160,803]]]'>Now, when it is considered, that the purchase-money was only $125 originally, the recovery on the Ashmead title, is no excuse for such backwardness on the part of Hean, and such trifling with the rights of the vendor. Hean, like every purchaser, was bound to be vigilant to perfect his purchase. If he meant to avail himself of the Maulfair title, he should have prepared himself to pay for it. If he thought the Ashmead title was better, and therefore surrendered his rights under the contract with Maulfair, we may regret the mistake he made, but cannot permit his vendee to return after so much time, and all that has occurred, to set up that contract as if it had not been abandoned. It would not be according to the course of equity to do so. Once abandoned, the contract was abandoned for ever. It never existed except in parol, and when the 'written lease was taken it was extinguished. As was remarked before, it would be an odd decree for equity to make, that a man was in possession under a valid parol purchase, whilst he himself says, in writing, that he was in merely as a renter: 7 <em>Casey </em>405. It is vain to expect specific performance of a contract treated as this has been.</p>
    <p id="b510-7" data-blocks='[["BL_510.7",510,[270,1734,1159,634]]]'>We see no occasion for modifying our former ruling. We attach very little importance to the question whether Maulfair was present, and assenting to what the deputy sheriff said whilst executing the writ of possession in December 1858. It is a very common, and in the winter time a most proper mode of executing such writs, to take a lease on a nominal rent from the defendant, and leave him in possession. This seems to have been done in the ordinary manner. What the sheriff’s officer thought would be the legal effect of the act he was performing, is of no consequence, and even if Maulfair assented to that <em>thought, </em>it amounted to nothing. It could amount to nothing, unless it was the making of a new contract for the land, or the revival of the old, on terms and conditions so distinct that we would know how to enforce them. To expand it to this extent would be an extravagant conceit.</p>

It is much to be regretted that so important and well-considered a branch of our law of real estates does not commend itself to the approbation of a highly enlightened judge; but since he did his whole duty in applying to this case the rule of decision which had been furnished to him, notwithstanding his doubts, it only remains that we affirm his judgment.</p>
    <p id="b511-6" data-blocks='[["BL_511.6",511,[844,740,448,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
