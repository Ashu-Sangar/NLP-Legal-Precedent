I tried in the first instance to put him off. He still held on to me, trying to persuade me to do it. At last I promised to write it, if he would <em>save me the trouble of hunting up boundaries of a part he was going to sell. He said he would do so. </em>I asked him what part he was going to convey. He told me it was a lot off the eastern side of it. I asked him what sized lot.

Smith then left me, and before he returned with the description of the lot, MeClan called on me. — He simply asked me if Smith had been at me to write a deed for a lot he was going to sell him off the Keepers’ lot. I told him Smith had been with me, and I had promised to do it as soon as I could. He said he hoped I would have it done as soon as possible. I then asked him about the part of the lot he was to get. McClan’s description was the same exactly as Smith’s; or it amounted to the same thing. Nothing then happened till <em>Smith brought me a piece of paper of which he gave me in his own handwriting, a description of the ground </em>sold.— The conversations between Smith and MeClan and me were on the same day; but whether it was the same day that Smith brought the description I can’t tell. <em>I wrote the deed after night, on the day he gave me the description of the boundaries, as they are in this deed from Smith to Me Qian. In writing the deed it was my intention to put in the description of the boundaries, precisely as he gave it to me. </em>Whether I copied it correctly, at this day, I can’t say. I tried to do so. I saw the deed signed and acknowledged at my store. Before it was signed and acknowledged, while <em>Smith and Mc.Qlan were both </em>there, <em>I suggested something </em>about the depth of a town lot, <em>that this did not correspond with a town lot as they professed to sell and buy. They both replied it made no difference ; </em>they were aware it was more than 240 feet, the depth of a town lot, but they intended to sell the depth of it north and south. After the deed was executed, I left them at the justice’s office. After Smith and MeClan arranged their business, the same day the deed was executed, they came to me to draw this assignment to Elizabeth Nicholson, who I understood from them was a daughter of MeClan. He said it was the only thing he could do for her, and he wanted to do it before his death. It was at this stage, <em>I mentioned, whether it would not be better to mark the town lot off, </em>as she was a stranger. <em>I had ashed </em>them, <em>whether they had marked it off in any way. </em>He said that they did not, but, <em>it made very little difference about that part of it; </em>as it could not <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>induce her to come here to take possession of it, <em>and no doubt as soon as he sent it to her she would want to sell it soon afterwards, </em>and that he supposed she would sell it back to Smith.

When McClan said this, Smith was present. </em>Smith and McClan took the deed and went away.”</p>

I think, I told him, I did not know its value at that time; that all I knew was, that Smith had sold off a town lot to McClan, and it was his purpose to give it to his daughter gratuitously. I don’t know that there was much further conversation between us. I recollect telling him, I had done the writing, <em>and had given it no further thought. It is only since the dispute arose, that 1 began to think back, </em>and call to mind what had transpired.

It is admitted by both parties, that the lot originally owned by Mary Keepers, about which the present difficulty arises, was of the following dimensions: It extended 270 feet along Steel’s lane, and from its eastern corner on said lane, northerly along the line of a lot of the late John Agnew 277 feet, to the line of lands of Isaac B. Parker, Esq.; thence along said line westerly 264 feet, to the land formerly of Bev. Geo.

This lot was conveyed by Mary Keepers to Samuel S. Smith, the plaintiff, by deed dated the 28tji April 1835. On the 7th June 1852, Samuel S. Smith executed a deed to Robert MeClan, in which the property conveyed was thus described: ‘ All that certain lot or piece of ground situate on the north side of Steel’s lane, in said borough, enclosed within the following lines: on the south by said road or lane from the western to the eastern corner; thence ímnning northerly along the line of property of the late John Agnew on the east to the corner or line; thence on the north by property of Isaac B.

Smith, as on reference to it being had will appear.’ The title to the land thus conveyed by Smith to MeClan was afterwards, by subsequent conveyance, vested in William H.

The distances of none of the lines are given. The first line described is on Steel’s lane from the western to the eastern corner, not of the lane, but of the lot conveyed, but how far it begins on Steel’s lane from the line of Agnew’s lot, which is the second line called for on the deed, there is no possible mode of determining from the deed. It may be five feet or 265 feet from Agnew’s lot, and in either case answers the call and description in the deed from Smith to MeClan. One thing is evident from the deed, Smith did not intend to convey the whole of the lot he purchased from Mrs. Keepers to MeClan, for the deed says it is a part of the lot which Mrs. Keepers sold Smith by deed of 28th April 1835. It further calls for property of said Samuel S. Smith on the west (being the other part of said property), and does not call for a lot or lots of Rev. George Duffield, now owned by Mr. Parker, as the western boundary, as does the deed from Mrs. Keepers to Smith. In this state of the evidence, as presented by the paper titles, how are we to pass upon the rights of the respective parties. The deed from Smith to MeClan certainly describes a part, but not the whole of the Keepers lot. How much does it include within its boundaries ? Here we are at sea without chart or compass; there is nothing in the deed to afford us even a glimmering of the quantity conveyed. The defendant’s counsel say we cannot call to our aid parol testimony to explain this other<a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>wise unintelligible conveyance; that the defendant has possession, and if the deed does not fix and determine the quantity of land not included in the conveyance, the plaintiff cannot recover. It is an undoubted principle of law that you cannot, by parol evidence, contradict, alter, enlarge, or diminish the import and meaning of a deed, where it is written so as to be intelligent, and has a meaning which can be understood; but where a written conveyance is so unmeaning as to give, as in this case, not even a glimmering of the quantity of land conveyed, it does not fall within the principle of law we have stated, and parol evidence may be used to explain and render certain that which otherwise would be inexplicable and uncertain.</p>

The same description existed in all the conveyances subsequent to that of Smith to McClan, as was contained in that one. This constituted the defendant’s case, he claiming that his title covered the whole lot also. But this was manifestly an erroneous view of the case, for by the express terms of the deed under which he claimed, only a part of the Mary Keepers lot was conveyed to McClan, and subsequently to him. To rebut the defendant’s claim and limit, his grant to the sixty feet, the plaintiff offered parol evidence to explain what the parties, Smith and McClan, really intended to convey — that it was only an ordinary town-lot of sixty feet in width ana two hundred and forty feet in depth; and that there was a misdescription, by mistake of the scrivener, that the extent of the grant was not mentioned in the deed. This evidence was admitted under objection by the defendant, and forms his first bill of exception.</p>

It was a step in the case, and could not be rejected, having been placed on that footing. But the evidence, being received, did not come up to the offer. Notwithstanding this, however, the court gave effect to it, as if mistake had been proved, and referred it to the jury as a ground upon which the defendant’s deed might be reformed. As the learned judge was asked in substance to charge that as no mistake was shown, the evidence could not have the effect <em>claimed; </em>and as this was also in substance refused by him, we think he erred. It is too well settled to admit of controversy, that title to land cannot be extended by parol, unless under the contingency of proof of fraud or mistake, nor can it be limited but for the same reason.</p>

The defendant rested on his conveyances, as covering part of the Mary Keepers lot. He could not possibly claim the whole, for in two different places, the deed to McClan describes the ground as being but a part of it. Besides, too, the west line was to be bounded by part of the same lot. The corners mentioned, as on Steel’s lane on the south, and on the opposite side again by J. B. Parker’s land, are not mentioned as <em>the </em>corners of the lot, but as <em>a </em>corner on the one side, and <em>a </em>corner on the other. These corners were never fixed by the parties. Under these circumstances, the defendant’s title was entirely vague and uncertain. It ivas for a part of the Mary Keepers lot, off the eastern side, but for how much it is impossible, from the deeds, to say. The defendant did not attempt to explain the uncertainty. If the plaintiff had gone for the whole <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>lot, it is not easy to see how the defendant could have maintained himself at all. He certainly could not have done so, without bringing himself within some rule which would have enabled him to have defined his title <em>dehors </em>the deeds. The plaintiff, however, has saved him this trouble, by conceding of record his title to the sixty feet, and by averring it in court. Under these circumstances, we think the error did the defendant no harm. There was not a *- particle of evidence to show that the old fence or row of peach-trees was to be the line — neither party proved this; and there was no reason for any presumption of the fact on the face of the deeds. For these reasons, we affirm this judgment.</p>
