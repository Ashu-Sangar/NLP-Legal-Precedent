Before the auditor, the trustee objected to the allowance to the executor of credits for such payments beyond the annual income of the children; he also claimed that the accountant should be charged with interest on the moneys remaining uninvested in his hands; and that commission should not be allowed on debts included in the inventory but not collected, nor on the value of the household furniture delivered to the widow and children under the will. And on the hearing of exceptions to the auditor’s report, the court below so decreed, the following opinion being delivered by Thompson, P. J.:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b259-8" data-blocks='[["BL_259.8",259,[187,2089,1159,345]],["BL_260.1",260,[303,398,1163,132]]]'>“ The language used by the testator in the eighth clause of his will, so clearly indicates the intention that the principal of the shares devised in trust for his children, should be received and held by the trustee, that we have no doubt of the correctness of the auditor’s decision upon this question. The trustee is directed not only to dispose of the income, but to appropriate a part of the principal in'case of the marriage of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>for her immediate use, and to hold the remainder for her sole and sepa<a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>rate use, so as not to be liable for the debts of any husband, and to pay the principal at her death to such persons as she shall by her last will direct and appoint.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b260-6" data-blocks='[["BL_260.6",260,[297,529,1168,471]]]'>“ These powers given to the trustee, of necessity require that the trust fund should be in his hands ; so the testator has willed it, and the apparent inconsistency arising out of the language of the sixth clause of the will, is obviated by permitting the executors to retain and invest an amount sufficient to secure the payment of the annuity given to the wife of the testator. There is no necessity that they should hold the shares of the children, having no authority to dispose either of the principal or income of those shares, for the care of which the testator has selected another person. This construction of the will disposes of the first, second, and tenth exceptions filed by the accountant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b260-7" data-blocks='[["BL_260.7",260,[291,1001,1176,1193]]]'>“The third, fourth, and fifth exceptions are to the charge of interest against the accountant. It appears that a considerable sum of money was received by the accountant which was not invested by him nor paid over to the trustee, and that a further’ sum sufficient to meet the expenses of administration was in his hands. No sufficient reason appears for the retention of the sum in question. His duty was to invest it, or rather to pay it over to the trustee; he did neither, but kept possession of it, and is of course chargeable with interest upon it. The payments which he assumed to make, out of the principal belonging to the several children, were not warranted by any facts shown. The trustee, who was the proper party to deal with the shares of the children, could not be allowed to expend the principal of their trust-moneys, in addition to the income, unless a strong case of necessity could be shown to justify such an encroachment upon the fund. No such necessity has been shown to exist; and even if the trustee consented to such a misappropriation of the funds (which is not admitted), he could not confer an authority upon, the executor which he did not possess himself, and which the law will not sanction. The accountant could not, therefore, properly charge against the sum due by him for interest, the amount he had expended from the principal. Nor was the executor entitled to credit in his account for the sums paid out of the principal of the trust. The very object of the trust, was to preserve the principal, not to expend it, and the auditor in refusing to allow the credits claimed, decided in accordance with the true principle which should regulate such a trust. The seventh, eighth, and ninth exceptions are therefore unsustained.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b260-8" data-blocks='[["BL_260.8",260,[291,2202,1159,173]],["BL_261.1",261,[208,440,1157,77]]]'>“ The sixth exception is based upon a mistake of a fact. It was supposed by the accountant, and the auditor seems to have taken it for granted, that by the inventory filed, the accountant was charged with the sum of $11,317.72, which consisted of outstand<a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>ing debts due to the partnership of which the testator was a member.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.6",261,[183,525,1181,476]]]'>“ This was not the case; the whole amount of the inventory as stated by the appraisers was $26,751.47, which did include , the sum in question. But had that amount been introduced into the inventory, the executor could have thereby derived no right to charge commissions upon it — the partnership debts were under the care of the surviving partner, and were not subject to the control of the executor. He had no such interest in them as would entitled him to interfere in their management. His own statement, that the amount of the debts had been improperly introduced into the inventory (as he supposed was the fact), is a sufficient answer to any such claim for compensation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b261-7" data-blocks='[["BL_261.7",261,[199,1000,1160,559]]]'>“ The remaining exceptions are disposed of by the views already expressed in relation to the expenditures made from the principal of the trust funds, except the additional exception which relates to the sum to be retained by the executor and invested to raise the sum of $300 per annum for the widow. In considering this exception, the auditor intimates a strong impression, that the sum should be larger than the amount he at first considered sufficient. The testator doubtless intended that the clear sum of $300 should be paid each year to his widow, without deduction for charges and expenses, and to raise that amount, we think the sum of $5700 would not be more than adequate; that sum is therefore directed to be invested under the terms of the will, instead of the sum fixed by the auditor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b261-8" data-blocks='[["BL_261.8",261,[197,1558,1160,678]]]'>“ The only other matter that has not been mentioned in considering the objections made by the accountant, is the calculation of interest made by the auditor upon the funds in the accountant’s hands up to the time of the audit. In general, it is better to adjust and settle the account as it is filed, unless additions are made by way of surcharge; but as in this ease, the auditor made distribution of the whole fund from which interest had accrued, and the calculation of the interest to the same period, was designed to settle the entire liability of the accountant, so as to render it unnecessary to file a subsequent account, for any matter connected with that portion of the trust property. The auditor received and allowed the additional claims made by the accountant up to the same period, and as the entire account appears to have been closed thereby, the irregularity, which works no injury to any one, is not of sufficient importance to disturb the distribution as made by the auditor.</p>

Robinson, were not much pressed by counsel; the first of those exceptions is, however, properly taken, to the allowance of commissions by the auditor, upon outstanding debts and estimated interests, which were never realized, and as to which the executor assumed <a id="p262" href="#p262" data-label="262" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*262</a>no responsibility and performed no services; commissions are paid as a remuneration for trouble and responsibility, and the mere introduction of items on one side of the account, to take credit for them on the other as unavailable assets, without having made any attempt to realize them, or bestowed any labour upon them, gives no title to any reward whatever. In this we disagree with the views expressed by the auditor, and as to all such items sustain the exception. The remaining exceptions taken by the trustee seem not to be well founded, and are not sustained.”</p>
