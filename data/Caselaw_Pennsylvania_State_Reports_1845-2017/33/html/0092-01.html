This rule is sometimes amplified thus: — If the remainder is to persons standing in the relation of heirs general or special of the tenant for life, the law presumes them to take as heirs, unless it unequivocally appears that individuals, other than persons who are to take simply as heirs, are intended: 28 <em>State Rep. </em>103; <em>Smith on Executory Interests, </em>§§ 472, 479 ; <em>Fearne </em>188; <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Binn.%20163" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="3 Binn. 163">3 <em>Binn. </em>163</a> ; 1 <em>Man. &amp; Gr. </em>429; 1 <em>Bro.

This is only another way of devising to the plaintiff for life with remainder to her heirs, or to the plaintiff and her heirs, and is the same in principle as the case of Steacy <em>v. </em>Rice, 27 <em>State Rep. </em>82. The roundabout way which the testator takes to say “ heirs” does not affect the substance: see Bush’s Appeal, <em>ante </em>85. Her heirs are, first, her descendants, and next, her next of kin on the side of the testator, that is <em>his heirs </em>(Act of 8th April 1833, § 9), and this is just the line of inheritance described by him.</p>
