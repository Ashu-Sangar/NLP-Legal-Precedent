Gibson, prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia county, to recover several distinct penalties for taking illegal fees, and for omitting to post a copy of the fee-bill in his office.</p>

Judgment having been entered on the verdict, the defendant sued out this writ, and here assigned for error, that the court below had no jurisdiction of an action for several distinct penalties, each for a less sum than the amount necessary to give jurisdiction.</p>

And it is not at all necessary for us to vindicate or deny the accuracy of the distinction taken, in Gault <em>v. </em>Vinyard, 2 <em>Casey </em>282, between the Nisi Prius and the District Court, relative to jurisdiction. If the distinction is not well founded, then both courts have jurisdiction of such a case; and if it is well founded, the District Court, and not the Nisi Prius, has. So that, take it either way, the jurisdiction of this ease was rightly taken; and we do not discover any error in the trial.</p>
