Her husband is now dead, and she claims that the legacy is now her own, in absolute right, discharged of the trust, and ought to be paid over to her; and so it was decreed in the court below.

Now that the husband is dead, the trust is without purpose, and she may claim an account and payment of the legacy; and this has 'very often been decided: 20 <em>State R. </em>302; 27 <em>Id. </em>75; 23 <em>Id. 30; </em>26 <em>Id. </em>231; and the authorities there cited.</p>

A devise to one for life, with remainder to his heirs, or to the heirs of his body, in legal or equitable form, gives a fee simple or fee tail in land: 20 <em>State R. </em>264; 21 <em>Id. </em>343; 24 <em>Id. </em>252; and an absolute right to personal property: 23 <em>Id. </em>10, 388 ; 28 <em>Id. </em>103; 30 <em>Id. </em>168, 180; 19 <em>Ves. </em>73 ; 1 <em>Bro.
