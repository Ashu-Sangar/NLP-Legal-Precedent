It is quite plain, that the present title depends upon faith in that department of government which alone may deal with such a subject, and upon the good faith of government in protecting those that trust in it. Men naturally trust in their government, and ought to do so, and they ought not to suffer for it.</p>
    <p id="b500-6" data-blocks='[["BL_500.6",500,[321,688,1159,1113]]]'>This is acting in conformity with ordinary experience, and with the appearance of things as sanctioned by the highest civil authorities ; and it is a plain moral duty of government to protect such acts. This duty is the most obvious moral element on which the doctrine of <em>stare decisis </em>is founded; and when this doctrine must be departed from, the courts ought to see that no transaction that is evidently based upon it should be affected by the departure. The same element is involved in the practice of allowing amendments of mistakes of the courts or their officers, so as not to affect third persons — in the doctrine, that sales made under judgments are valid, even though the judgments should afterwards be annulled and set aside for error — in the doctrine, that the officers of the courts are protected in executing the orders and judgments of the courts, even though erroneous — in the doctrine, that the confirmation of a sheriff’s deed cures all mere irregularities in the proceeding — in the doctrine, that conveyances, void or voidable in law or equity, for fraud or mistake, are yet sustained in protection of <em>bond fide </em>purchasers — in proceedings <em>in rem </em>for the benefit of all concerned, where a sale of the thing passes the title, however erroneous the judgment — and in the doctrine, that justifies and protects obedience to a government in fact, though not in right. Indeed, it is an essential principle of government; for, if the right to trust to the highest governmental functionaries is denied, and such trust is unprotected, every man is bound to question every act of government that affects him, and to resist whatever he does not approve — a doctrine that would make government impossible.</p>
    <p id="b500-7" data-blocks='[["BL_500.7",500,[322,1800,1153,512]]]'>There is no equality of equities between these parties. The controversy between Menges and Oyster turned upon a single principle of law, and they submitted that to the umpirage of the state, through its appropriate functionaries, and argued it as well as they could, and they were bound by the decision, whether it was right or wrong, so long as it stood in force; for, necessarily, the state is the final mediator in all controversies, and it cannot do better than express itself according to the degree of intelligence of its functionaries. A citizen may suffer by mistakes of government; and so he may by his own or by those of his private agents, or of his family or copartners, or friends. They cannot be corrected at the expense of others.</p>
    <p id="b500-8" data-blocks='[["BL_500.8",500,[319,2313,1152,130]]]'>For the purposes of this case, the decision in Menges <em>v. </em>Wertman must be treated as correct; and, therefore, there is no error in this judgment.</p>
    <p id="b500-9" data-blocks='[["BL_500.9",500,[1096,2441,331,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
