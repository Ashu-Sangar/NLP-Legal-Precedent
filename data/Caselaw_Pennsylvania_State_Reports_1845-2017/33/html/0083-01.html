It says they shall be void against subsequent purchasers and mortgagees, if not recorded in proper time and place; unless recorded before the subsequent ones. Here the law was violated in relation to both the prior and the subsequent ones; but the prior one was first recorded, and therefore the condition on which it was to be void did not arise.</p>

Purchasers ought to know that they have only a conditional title, dependent on the honesty of their vendors, so long as they neglect to record their deeds. They are not safe merely because of the neglect of a former purchaser to record within six months, and of there being no subsequent deed to oppose them; but because, among several deceived purchasers, they are the first to obey the law.</p>
