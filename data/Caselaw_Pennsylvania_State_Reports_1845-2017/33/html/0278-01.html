Almost all contracts have such motives. A man may sell his house or his horse because he does not wish to keep it, or does it under some moral or financial necessity of parting with it, or thinks that it will better suit another to úse it or take care of it, as well as because he is getting a price for it in money or other valuable things.. It is still a sale, notwithstanding these private motives, and though the price may be a low one.</p>

This is a part of their duty in every act of legislation. They must express and act upon the motives of the people in every exercise of their legitimate authority. Whether they do it well and faithfully or not, the people must judge; for they have instituted no authority to do it for them.</p>

In the very nature of humanity, people <em>must </em>trust very largely to the good faith and discretion of their public agents, if they would have a government that is worth anything. They cannot have an efficient government, if they do not allow it a large freedom in its movements. And they cannot have honest and honourable men in office, if they are to be always suspected by the people because of their office. And if the people choose dishonest men for public positions, no amount of suspicion and no system of checks will be adequate to save them from the evils and cost of a dishonest government.</p>

Motives belong to our interior morality, and are not naturally subject to legal regulation; and so far as the <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>state attempts it, all liberty of conscience is endangered. Morality regards action and its motives, while law regards the action alone. Law does not sanction or <em>allow </em>improper motives, but it is incompetent to read them; they belong to the forum of conscience. Law has no condemnation for acts that are not unlawful, while morality takes higher ground and condemns conduct if its <em>motives </em>be bad.</p>

Law, the more it undertakes to treat conduct by motives, the more it is apt to be disorderly and tyrannical. It does, sometimes, pass judgment upon malicious and fraudulent motives, when it finds external acts clearly indicating them, and in such cases especially it is often cruelly oppressive in its conclusions. We cannot thus try legislative acts. To judge of their validity by motives would be impossible, for the prevailing motive in the mind of every member might be different.</p>

A private agent to sell simply acts out the motives, known or unknown, of his principal; whereas a legislator has generally to seek, in his own experience and observation, for the motives which ought to justify his acts and to be satisfactory to the public. Moreover, the judicial authority of the state is instituted to judge of the fulfilment of the duties of private relations, and not to decide whether legislators have faithfully fulfilled theirs; though, as judicial authority, it may protect private rights even against legislative acts, if they are forbidden by the constitution.</p>

The sole foundation of the arguments to establish these points is, that the price and the security are inadequate. But on this subject we are not authorized to supervise or review the discretion and judgment of the legislature. If we could supervise it, we could direct and control it, and we have not this much authority <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>over the political discretion even of municipal corporations.

It may he, that some members may have thought that a connection of the Sunbury and Erie with the Allegheny Valley Road would be a valuable one, and would increase the security of the debt to the state; and that the North Branch Canal would he best managed for the public good, by being owned by the people of the neighbourhood. But we are not called upon to ascertain or account for legislative motives, for we could not sit in judgment upon them, even if we knew them.
