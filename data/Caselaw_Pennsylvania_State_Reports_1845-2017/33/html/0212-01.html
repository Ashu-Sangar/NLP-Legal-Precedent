    <p id="b219-9" data-blocks='[["BL_219.9",219,[212,1176,1157,172]]]'>It will be observed, that all these conversations must have taken place prior to the 1st February 1854, when the contract was executed between Mr. Brown and the city, which was reported to and ratified by councils the next day.</p>
    <p id="b219-10" data-blocks='[["BL_219.10",219,[218,1348,1152,88]]]'>After all power to contract had ceased on the part of the city or its agents, the following receipt was signed by the plaintiff:—</p>
    <p id="b219-11" data-blocks='[["BL_219.11",219,[215,1450,1156,259]]]'>“ Received, April 5th 1854, of George W. Brown, his note dated April 5th 1854, at three months, for one thousand dollars, it being part of the purchase-money of lot and stables situate on the southeast corner of Locust street and Raspberry alley, which I agree to sell clear of all encumbrances, for the sum of sixty-seven hundred dollars — the title papers to be transferred immediately.</p>
    <p id="Acd" data-blocks='[["BL_219.12",219,[262,1706,1062,41]]]'>“$1,000. G. S. Twitchell.”</p>
    <p id="b219-12" data-blocks='[["BL_219.13",219,[219,1773,1151,86]]]'>The note was paid at maturity, and was produced on the trial by Brown the witness.</p>
    <p id="b219-13" data-blocks='[["BL_219.14",219,[218,1859,1152,258]]]'>This receipt is entirely consistent with the contract of the city with Mr. Brown, and on its face proves only a sale by Twitchell to Brown, and a payment by the latter of a part of the purchase-money. It is, however, contended that it is a contract between Twitchell and the city, signed, it is true, only by the vendor, but accepted by the vendee’s agent.</p>
    <p id="b219-14" data-blocks='[["BL_219.15",219,[214,2117,1154,297]]]'>It is hardly necessary to repeat, that on the 5th April 1854, no person could have any authority, on the part of the city, to make such a contract for it, or to draw up any such receipt, whether relating to a former or a present purchase; and that the mode of payment by the promissory note of an individual is entirely without precedent, in eases of purchases made by municipal corporations for public objects.</p>
    <p id="b220-5" data-blocks='[["BL_220.5",220,[259,390,1157,427]]]'>
      <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>But there is another insuperable difficulty in this ease, that George W. Brown was not an agent of the city “ thereunto lawfully authorized by writing,” which is an essential requisite, by our Act of Assembly, in such a contract for the purchase of lands, in order to enable a vendor to enforce a specific performance of it : Vanhorne <em>v. </em>Frick, 6 <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>90; McDowell <em>v. </em>Simpson, <a href="/watts/3/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts 129" data-case-ids="1841257" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0129-01">3 <em>Watts </em>129</a>; Parrish <em>v. </em>Koons, 1 <em>Parsons </em>89. All the cases cited by the plaintiff in error to establish the contrary doctrine, occurred under the 4th and 17th sections of the English Statute of Frauds, which sections were never re-enacted in this state.</p>
    <p id="b220-6" data-blocks='[["BL_220.6",220,[260,818,1152,384]]]'>This disposes of this branch of the case, and it is very clear that the evidence not only does not support the allegation that there was any parol contract between the city and the plaintiff for the breach of which an action for damages could be sustained, but directly the contrary. All the evidence proves a contract for the whole lot by Brown, for $75,000: and why this contract made by him with the city upwards of five years ago has never been completed on his part, the testimony in this case does not explain.</p>
    <p id="b220-7" data-blocks='[["BL_220.7",220,[260,1202,1149,129]]]'>This matter was, however, left to the jury by the court below, in the most favourable manner for the plaintiff; and as they decided against him, it cannot be reviewed here.</p>
    <p id="b220-8" data-blocks='[["BL_220.8",220,[259,1330,1151,163]]]'>The court made no error in their charge to the jury, and we see none in their rejection of testimony offered by the plaintiff; which, if admitted, could- not in any manner have aided or advanced his case.</p>
    <p id="b220-9" data-blocks='[["BL_220.9",220,[259,1501,1151,342]]]'>These large contracts made with municipal corporations, which, although legal, stand on the very utmost verge of the law, and are often, as in the present case, highly improvident, should always be strictly scrutinized by courts of justice. And where, as in this instance, the whole scheme has utterly failed, with a most serious pecuniary loss to the city and their constituents, the shock upon the community often leads to other results which are greatly to be deplored.</p>
    <p id="b220-10" data-blocks='[["BL_220.10",220,[259,1842,1151,559]]]'>This court, upon bills filed against The Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of Philadelphia, and the vendors of these market sites and markets, and amongst others George W. Brown, on the 3d April 1854, decided that the contracts made prior to the passage of the consolidation act on the 2d February 1854, were legal. The opinion was published on the 4th April, in the newspapers of the city, but by some mistake has never appeared in our reports. In his answer to the bills filed, Mr. Brown alleged that he sold the said property, on the 1st February. 1854, to the corporation of the city, and executed the contract above stated on that day, that the price was a fair and reasonable one, and that he intended to proceed to execute and perform his covenants in said contract, unless restrained by the court.</p>

      <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>In the printed argument submitted to the court, his counsel says, “ Mr. Brown sold and the city bought certain property. If he can make a title to the latter, it is no affair of theirs whether at the time he agreed to sell he had title to the property or acquired it since. He alleges in his answer, that he intends to perform the covenants in his contract.”</p>
    <p id="b221-6" data-blocks='[["BL_221.6",221,[216,696,1153,78]]]'>On the next day, the 5th April, the receipt is signed by Mr. Twitchell.</p>
    <p id="b221-7" data-blocks='[["BL_221.7",221,[213,783,1159,427]]]'>The result of this speculation may be summed up in a few words. None of the market-houses contracted for have been or ever will be built, and the Broad street market-house has as yet produced no revenue. Lots No. 1, 2, 8, and 4, cost the city $228,000 in cash, or its equivalent, and have subjected them to the payment of two annual ground-rents of $1500 each. Lot No. 3 has been conveyed to the Commonwealth for the erection of a state arsenal, the city agreeing to pay the ground-rent of $1500; and it is now proposed to sell No. 4, for its original price, $28,000.</p>
    <p id="b221-8" data-blocks='[["BL_221.8",221,[210,1213,1161,129]]]'>This costly outlay for nothing is now entirely superseded by private corporate enterprise, which promises to supply the old city proper with well arranged and convenient market-houses.</p>
