      <em>habere facias possessionem </em>are well executed when the tenant attorns to the plaintiff therein. And the taking of a lease or contract of purchase under pressure of such writ, where there is no fraud or collusion, is an actual eviction in law, which dissolves the relation between the tenant and his original landlord.</p>
    <p id="b454-6" data-blocks='[["BL_454.6",454,[330,645,1151,633]]]'>Nor does the recovery back of the premises, in a second ejectment by the landlord, subject the tenant to liability for rent for the period that elapsed between eviction and restitution. As between the immediate parties in ejectment — that is, those who hold the respective titles — a judgment of restitution is restoration of the plaintiff to all he lost in the former suit: Breading <em>v. </em>Blocher, 5 <em>Casey </em>349. If there is a tenant in possession, though he be the same the plaintiff put there, he must turn out or attorn again to his original landlord, but complete restitution to the premises does not entitle the landlord to recover rent from the tenant whom he failed successfully to defend. The covenant to pay rent here was reciprocal to that for quiet enjoyment, and though the landlord may recover damages by way of mesne profits from the adversary who disturbed his possession, he cannot compel the .tenant to pay him rent for the time his own covenant was in a state of breach.</p>
    <p id="b454-7" data-blocks='[["BL_454.7",454,[329,1285,1148,249]]]'>These principles decide this cause. It is argued, that Dysart &amp; Earhart should respond on their lease, because of the inflexible loyalty which is due from tenant to landlord. But protection and allegiance are reciprocal. What they covenanted to pay rent for, was quiet enjoyment, and as Ross did not secure them that, he has no claim on them for rent.</p>

The <em>habere facias, </em>under which the tenant attorned to the new landlord, in that case, was set aside, and the lease fell with it. The tenant was restored to his original relation as a consequence. But here the execution was valid, until a second judgment and execution superseded it.</p>
