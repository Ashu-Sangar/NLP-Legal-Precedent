When the writ of error issued, the parties admit that defendant entered into recognisance with George Hendel as his surety. Execution was issued by the plaintiffs on the 11th of June 1858. Mr. Quigley, the prothonotary, states that Mr. Rheem asked him if the bail was good enough. Mr. Quigley said it was; but nothing was said whether one or two sureties was required.</p>

The next section provides, that if such writ of error shall be issued, served, and bail entered within three weeks from the day on which the judgment shall be entered, such writ of execution shall be stayed and suspended upon the payment of costs, &amp;c.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b357-6" data-blocks='[["BL_357.6",357,[206,675,1150,214]]]'>“ In Henry <em>v. </em>Boyle, 1 <em>Miles </em>386, it was held, that under the English statutes in force in Pennsylvania, a writ of error was no <em>supersedeas </em>unless accompanied by a recognisance <em>with two sufficient sureties. </em>Although our act does not name any number, it has the term sureties, which necessarily implies more than one.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b357-7" data-blocks='[["BL_357.7",357,[204,889,1184,1412]]]'>“ But it is said, the record is removed and not in the Common Pleas, so as to authorize an execution, and particularly after the case was docketed and had been continued by the Supreme Court. The answer to this is, that although the record of the proceedings is removed for the purpose of reviewing and correction of errors, there remains a valid judgment in the Common Pleas, until reversed, for the purpose of lien, <em>scire facias, </em>or action of debt: Falkner <em>v. </em>Franklin Fire Insurance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Leg.%20Int.%2070" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Leg. Int. 70">8 <em>Leg. Int. </em>70</a>. If the removal of the record to the Supreme Court without bail, or with but one surety, operates as a <em>supersedeas </em>after the return day, which is the argument of defendant’s counsel, it might in some cases operate as a virtual repeal of the Act of Assembly, which provides that it shall not be a <em>supersedeas </em>unless <em>sureties </em>shall become bound in recognisances, &amp;c.; for the case might be docketed and continued in the Supreme Court, within three weeks after the entry of judgment in the court below; nor can the action of the Supreme Court, in continuing the case, deprive the plaintiff of the security the law affords him. The case is properly before the Supreme Court without bail, and the plaintiff in error cannot be deprived of a hearing. It would be no ground to quash the writ of error. The Supreme Court could afford the plaintiff below no security for the payment of his money, upon a final adjudication, further than to say to him, if his adversary had not given him the security the law required to stay execution, he could issue execution, collect his money, and retain it as security for his judgment, to be restored if his judgment was erroneous. And this was their response in the case of Magill <em>v. </em>Kauffman, 4 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>318, where a motion was made to quash the writ, because the recognisance of bail was not conformable to , law; £ but the court, without deciding on the recognisance, refused to quash the writ, because even supposing the recognisance to be void, the suit was well removed, although the writ of error would not operate as a <em>supersedeas.’</em>
