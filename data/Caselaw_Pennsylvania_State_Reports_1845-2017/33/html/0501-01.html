In a legal sense, malice signifies a wrongful act, intentionally done, without justification or excuse; the popular sense is ill will towards a particular person, or actual intention to injure or defame him.</p>

It cannot he inferred from the acquittal of the defendants alone; but it may be inferred by you, if there is want of probable cause. Probable cause is a mixed question of law and fact — the jury are to determine as to the truth or falsity of the circumstances, and the court whether they amount to probable cause — unless in cases where there is an internal or close blending of the law and facts.</p>

It was further charged against them, that in passing Fisher’s horse and buggy, they, or one of them, struck his horse, and that this rapid riding and conduct of Forrester and others, was the result of a concert or agreement between them, when about leaving the church. If their motive was, or the motive of Ira Forrester was, to injure Isaac D. Fisher or his wife, or their horse and buggy, it would be malicious mischief in him or them, and would amount to probable cause. But if their conduct was the result of indiscretion, thoughtlessness in riding at a very rapid gait, accidentally touching Fisher’s horse'in passing, without malice on their part or intention to do wrong or injury, they would not be guilty of the crime charged against them. There does not appear to have been any concert or agreement between them before leaving the church, to behave improperly. If there is any such evidence, you will consider of it. If, in riding past Fisher, they intentionally struck his horse, or hallooed with a view to alarm his horse, there would be such acts, as might induce the belief in the mind of Mr. Fisher, that their object was to produce results that might be injurious to him or his property, or both.</p>

A number of witnesses have been examined, principally in reference to but few facts — the speed with which the young men travelled; their conduct before they left the church, where their horses had been hitched during the service in the church, along the road, and while passing Mr. Fisher, who was riding in his buggy with his wife; the width of the road at different places; and where his horse became restive. The plaintiff's witnesses testify that they did not proceed at a greater speed than an ordinary trot, and that two of them gallopped or cantered the natural pace or gait of these two horses; that they didn’t in passing Mr. Fisher touch his horse or buggy; that no noise was made; that there was no concert or agreement between them, before they left the church, or afterwards, to ride rapidly, or to do anything wrong to Mr. Fisher, or any one else; that they rode behind his buggy for some distance, until they came to a part of the road where they could turn out conveniently and pass him, and that they did so; the roads were very dusty at the time, so much so as to prevent those who were passing along the road that day from seeing any considerable distance ahead.</p>

Whether these different allegations are true or false, you will determine. <em>The injury that resulted from the eonduet of these young wen to Mr. Fisher or his </em>property, <em>was not very </em>severe, although it might have been. Mr. Fisher and his wife were no doubt put in fear. The horse probably became unruly, making it necessary to run him into a fence corner, a rail or more was disturbed, the horse got his leg over the trace, part of the harness was broke, and the cross piece and iron of the swiveltree.</p>

If Fisher did not know of the existence of the facts which had a tendency to show reasonable and probable cause, he could not act upon them, and you should be satisfied that he believed the facts amounted to the offence, which he charged against the young men. Whether he had this knowledge, and did so believe them, is a fact for you: 2 <em>Greenl. Ev. </em>§ 445; and the court submit to you to determine, whether there was probable cause, not upon the trial and acquittal of the defendants in the procution against them for malicious mischief, but upon Fisher’s belief honestly entertained of their guilt: <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20439" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 439">5 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>439</a>. Justifiable probable cause, in a technical sense, is said to be a deceptive appearance of guilt, which arises from facts and circumstances misapprehended or misunderstood, so far as to produce belief. The belief, however, although it may have been strong in the mind of Mr. Fisher, will not avail him, if it was adduced by his own error, mistake, or negligence, without any occasion for suspicion .given him by the young men prosecuted.</p>

That both these ingredients must be proved, that malice need not be proved by positive and direct evidence, but may be inferred from the conduct of the prosecutor, and the facts and .circumstances in the cause. Fisher in this case denies the existence of malice on his part, and asserts that he had probable cause for the prosecution; in other words, that there was reasonable ground for suspicion, supported by such circumstances as were sufficient to warrant a cautious man in believing, that the party was guilty of the offence charged.</p>

If he honestly entertained the belief that the matters sworn to by him were true, and had reason to believe they were true, they might amount to probable cause, but if he did not honestly entertain this belief, and had not reason so to believe, or deposed to matters of which he had no knowledge, it would not amount to probable cause. Some evidence has been given as to the character of Mr. Fisher’s horse, and his habits, gentle or otherwise. From the evidence you will determine, so far as may be material for you to do so, whether the animal was gentle and safe in harness, or easily excited, and unsafe.</p>

Where a party does consult counsel before commencing proceedings, and makes a full, fair, and correct statement of facts, and acts in accordance with that advice, it does furnish sufficient probable cause for proceeding accordingly. If a material fact is purposely withheld from the counsel, or a statement given which the party knows to be incorrect, he cannot shelter himself under the legal advice he has sought and maintained. He must, at the time he seeks legal advice, act in good faith and state the facts truly and correctly. You have heard the testimony of Mr. Wolvcrton, the counsel consulted by Mr. Fisher, with which you can compare the facts as detailed by the witnesses, and from this examination determine, whether he intentionally withheld from his counsel a material fact, or intentionally made a false statement. The mistake of the counsel, if a mistake there were, cannot prejudice him.</p>

He believed that the defendant in error, plaintiff below, caused the affright of the horse by the rapid and noisy manner in which he and three other young men rode past the buggy on horseback, and accordingly applied to a respectable gentleman of the bar, who advised a prosecution of the young men for malicious mischief. A bill of indictment was found against them; but on trial, they were acquitted, and the costs put upon the county. Then came this action for malicious prosecution, which resulted on the first trial in a verdict for the defendant, which the court set aside; and on the second trial, in a verdict for the plaintiff for $60 damages. It is the judgment on the last verdict which is here for review.</p>

Still, however, we cannot help thinking that they were so placed before the jury as to lead them to the conclusion, that the defendant’s liability to damages depended on the guilt or innocence of the plaintiff in respect to the malicious mischief charged.</p>
    <p id="b506-12" data-blocks='[["BL_506.14",506,[274,2185,1153,256]],["BL_507.1",507,[191,424,1160,172]]]'>Take for instance those parts of the charge which relate to probable cause, and whilst many of the rules of law will be found correctly stated, we have the following language: “ if their motive was, or the motive of Ira Forrester was, to injure Isaac D.

But if their <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>conduct was the result of indiscretion, thoughtlessness in riding at a very rapid gait, accidentally touching Fisher’s horse in passing, without malice on their part or intention to do wrong or injury, they would not be guilty of the crime charged against them.”</p>
    <p id="b507-6" data-blocks='[["BL_507.6",507,[180,591,1168,1794]]]'>Now, if the learned judge had been trying the indictment for malicious mischief, this language might have been very proper; but in the case in hand, what had the jury to do with the motives of Forrester, or the question of his guilt or innocence ? They had rather to inquire into the motives of <em>Fisher </em>— whether .they were malicious or not, in instituting the prosecution of Forrester. That was the precise question on which the jury was to pass; and the fault of the charge is, not that this question was suppressed — for it was distinctly stated more than once — but that such observations as the above were thrown in, which were calculated to divert the jury’s attention from the true question, to another which did not arise upon the pleadings. It was possible, that Forrester should be innocent of the crime of malicious mischief, and yet that there should be such deceptive appearances of his guilt as justified Fisher’s prosecution. Fisher’s liability to damages did not depend on the question of Forrester’s guilt or innocence, but upon the question whether he had prosecuted him without probable cause. And when all the circumstances were taken into view — the rapid rate of the plaintiff’s riding, the affright of the defendant and his horse, and the advice received from his counsel, the court would have been quite justifiable in declaring, as a conclusion of law, that the defendant had probable cause. For these circumstances, which are of a nature to negative the malice of the prosecution, add themselves with great force to the <em>prim&amp;faeie </em>legal presumption, which is always in favour of public prosecutions. Indeed, the single fact that he acted under the advice of competent counsel, should have shielded him, unless there was evidence that he made the resort to counsel a mere cloak of his malice. And there was no such evidence. An apparent contradiction of the defendant on one or two points of minor importance, was brought out by a comparison of his testimony on the trial of the public prosecution, with that delivered by other witnesses on this trial; but there was nothing to impeach the fairness of his representations to his counsel. Mistaken he may have been about the striking of his horse, but it is impossible to see in the evidence, any disposition to fabricate a case against the young men. Doubtless, the defendant was greatly excited; and not wholly without cause. A group of gay and frolicksome boys, coming gallopping up behind the defendant’s horse, was an effectual way of rendering him unmanageable; and it is- not strange that the defendant should be mistaken, in some particulars, in recounting the events of the moment.</p>
