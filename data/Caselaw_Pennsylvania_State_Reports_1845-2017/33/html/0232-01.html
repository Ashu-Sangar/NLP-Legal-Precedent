That depends on the question of value. If the lot was encumbered in Monaghan’s hands to its full value, and could have been made to yield nothing to his creditors, they were not prejudiced by the conveyance, and the deed, though voluntary, would not be void. But if Monaghan had an atom of beneficial interest in the lot, his creditors had a right to it. On this single point of fact all the evidence is for the jury, the recitals in the deeds under which Mrs. Monaghan holds included. It is argued, that these recitals estop her from denying her husband’s interest, or the beneficial nature of it. I do not think so. If the deed could operate by way of estoppel, it would import a consideration, as well as that Monaghan had reduced the ground-rent by a payment, and thus the voluntary character of the instrument would be taken away, and it would stand a sale for a full price. But the doctrine of estoppel has no application to the case. Estoppels by deed must be mutual, and affect both parties and their privies. The plaintiff is not in privity •with either of the parties to the deed, but claims adversely to both. The recitals are evidence that the ground-rent was reduced by Mona<a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>ghan’s payment, but they conclude nothing. From the evidence of Husband, it would seem quite impossible that he could have paid any thing. If he did, he had an interest to that extent, but whether he paid any thing the jury will determine.”</p>
