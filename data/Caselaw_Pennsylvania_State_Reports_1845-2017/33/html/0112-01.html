Holcomb, against Green Clark, to recover the penalty prescribed by the 68th section of the Act of 13th June 1836, <em>[Brightly's Purd. </em>726, pl. 93), for obstructing a public road or highway, in Sugar Grove township, Warren county.</p>

But in 1852, the path-master caused a survey to be made, and moved the line of the road for a distance of upwards of two miles, from one to five rods east of the old road, as it had been opened and used for many years; and by so doing he took a strip of ground from the land of the defendant, which was bounded on the west by the centre of the highway. It was for obstructing the road so altered, that this action was brought.</p>
