Thus, if a husband wrongfully discard his wife, or turn his wife or child out of doors, the law will imply a promise on his part to pay for the necessaries of life, by whomsoever furnished, to the wife or child, in the same way as if they had been supplied to himself at his request. So also, because a man is bound to bury his deceased wife, the law implies his promise to pay her funeral expenses, though he live in a distant land, and the expenses were incurred without his knowledge or consent: Jenkins <em>v. </em>Tucker, 1 <em>H.

These moral obligations are enforceable only in <em>foro conscientics, </em>and not in courts of civil law. And it is essential to the action of <em>assumpsit, </em>even when, founded on a duty which is in the nature of a legal obligation, that the service sued for should have been rendered with a view to compensation. The cause of action must have sprung from faith in the legal obligation, and not from some other and an inconsistent motive.

Chancellor Kent’s observation, 2 <em>Com. </em>196, is not more elegant than just;— that a parent who sends his son into the world uneducated, and without skill in any art or science, does a great injury to mankind, as well as to his own family, for he defrauds the community of a useful citizen, and bequeaths to it a nuisance.</p>

If a father be not responsible for the support of a son who runs away, much less is he bound to indemnify a party who wrongfully takes away his son. A son eloigned is said to be entitled to his own earnings as a means of support, and perhaps a son carried off by force would be entitled to call on his father for support until he could return, but a demand by the party who carries him off stands on a different and less favourable footing. There was no evidence in this case, and of course no finding by the jury, that the father had ever shut his doors against his son, or that he had refused to receive and acknowledge him, and to provide for his necessities in a manner suitable to his condition in life.</p>

He might, it is true, have coerced the delivery of the son, but a mere failure to assert his rights does not change the character of the original trespass, nor raise any implication in favour of the wrongdoer. Whatever his motive for not asserting his right of custody, and whatever her motive for retaining the boy, it is manifest that this is not the case of a father refusing support, but it is the case of a son withheld from the father in disregard of his parental rights.

Such a one must be .found by the jury before it can be enforced, and here it is not. But her reliance is on a constructive or fictitious contract, adopted by the law for the purpose of sustaining an action of <em>assumpsit </em>where a duty to pay arises out of the facts: 29 <em>State R. </em>467.</p>

D.id he wrong the <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>mother by gratifying her wishes, and suffering her to keep their child which she had wrongfully carried off? Certainly not. . A wrongdoer cannot complain that the injured party did not resist or seek redress. She cannot complain of the expense of being allowed to have her own way. This cannot be made plainer. Kindness to the mother’s feelings for her son cannot be enforced by law; and. when it is exercised, it cannot be made the ground of a legal duty to do more. We must treat her as in the wrong, because the divorce, at his suit for her desertion, must be taken as proof of it.</p>

Yes, if thereby the child was left without support, which is not the case. But to this the mother is the principal party; and how can she make her own wrong against another the ground of an action against him ? She is claiming compensation for her own services and outlays, all growing out of a wrong done by her to him against whom she makes the claim. This cannot be allowed. The father is willing to take the child and support it himself. If she prefers to keep it, she can claim nothing from him as a right; and we cannot enforce the duty of generosity.</p>

But it is entirely impossible to treat a child as thus cast on the public, when the fact simply is,’ that the mother has deserted the father, and carried away the child and continues to support it. This is merely leaving it with her, until she chooses to restore it; and while she keeps it on such ground, she has no claim for compensation.</p>
