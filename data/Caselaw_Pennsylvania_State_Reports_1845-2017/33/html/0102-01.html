The cases of Paul <em>v. </em>Shallcross, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Rawle%20362" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Rawle 362">2 <em>Rawle </em>362</a>, and Banes <em>v. </em>Gordon, 9 <em>Barr </em>426, which have been cited on the part of the defendant, do not touch the point now before us; Banes <em>v. </em>Gordon, simply deciding that a purchaser at a sale made by executors under an order of court, will be discharged, if the terms of the second sale are varied by the executors of their own motion, without the sanction of the court; while Paul <em>v. </em>Shallcross is still more remote, and merely determines that a new agreement between the executors and the purchaser may supersede the old, or extinguish the obligations. The change made in the terms of the sale in the present instance, was made by order of the Orphans’ Court, and after due notice, and is consequently binding on the purchaser, unless the court has exceeded their powers in making it. The point is not free from difficulty; but we are, on the Avhole, of opinion, that whenever a sale falls through, from the default of the buyer, and there is sufficient ground for believing that the purchase was made without any intention to pay for it, in pursuance of a preconcerted scheme to defeat the ends of justice, and prevent or delay the completion of the sale, there must be a power somewhere to prevent a repetition of the same course, by making the terms of the second sale cash, even when those of the first have been credit, and requiring the whole or part of the price to be paid down at the time of the bid, without releasing the guilty party from the liability which is the only penalty for his misconduct. Any other conclusion would involve a dilemma, which obviously ought not to exist, and would compel the parties to choose between a release of the purchaser and an indefinite protraction of the sale. The rule for a new trial is consequently discharged, and judgment entered for the plaintiffs on the point reserved.”</p>

To deny the legal effects of such a sale, is to deny the right to make it. The Act of Assembly requires the sale to be made under the “ direction” of the court, and in a collateral proceeding they are always to be considered to have exercised a sound discretion.
