J.) delivered the following charge to the jury: — “ There are no disputed facts in this case. The plaintiff’s warrants are the oldest, but his surveys were made after those of the defendant. It has been argued as a question of law, that although the John Fox survey does not, as found upon the ground, meet all the calls of the warrant, and the James Fox survey as returned into the office, adjoins the John Fox on a side different from its call in the warrant, yet the application being joint, and the purchase-money paid for both tracts by one man, the warrants granted thereon, amounted to a purchase from the Commonwealth of 800 acres of land at a place described in the applications; and if the exterior lines of the two tracts taken together, embrace the land described in the applications as a whole, subsequent warrantees have nothing to do with the interior division of the land, <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>and cannot object that the tracts, in theiryelative positions to each other, and to the surrounding surveys, do not happen, severally, as surveyed and returned, to correspond with the calls of the respective warrants; that the owner of the tracts could divide it as he pleased, provided the exterior lines, as a whole, corresponded with the lands described in the warrants taken both together. To this position we cannot assent. John Fox is the leading warrant; it palls for ‘ adjoining land in the name of Mordeeai Massey on the north, and joining land of Fowler &amp; Co.’ James Fox calls for ‘adjoining land this day granted to John Fox on the north.’ John Fox does not come within half a mile of Fowler &amp; Co.; and James Fox, as located, adjoins John Fox on the east and not on the north. These warrants are not, therefore, of that descriptive character (being located differently) as would give title from the date of the warrant. There was no notice in the land office which would prevent others from taking out warrants and having surveys made; and as the defendant’s surveys are the eldest, your verdict must be for him. As to the James Fox survey, the defendant has shown he is the owner of it.”</p>

The only ground asserted for such a claim is, that the warrants taken separately do not conform in their actual location to all their calls. It is true, as a general rule, that the holder of a precisely descriptive warrant must, if he would claim title from its date, have it surveyed in conformity to its calls. Why ? Because the very foundation of his right to priority over the holder of a junior warrant, consists in the fact that, by his application, filed of record in the land office, he has given notice to all the world that he has purchased from the Commonwealth a portion of her lands embraced within the description; and subsequent purchasers from the Commonwealth are only to be affected to the extent and by the terms of the notice thus given. For the same reason, the title under an indescriptive warrant commences from the date of the survey made thereon, because the warrantee then, for the first time, gives notice of the location and extent of his purchase from the Commonwealth. But the rule thus stated, if founded upon <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>the reason already given, by no means sustains the judgment of the court below. The application for the Fox tract is a joint one; the purchase-money for the warrants being paid at one time by one individual, and both the surveys having been made upon the same day by the same surveyor, leaves no room to doubt that the land was applied for by a single individual, who purchased from the state 800 acres of land; and because the law forbade him to take more than 400 acres in one warrant, resorted to what was the every-day practice in the land office, of using the name of a friend in obtaining another 400 acre warrant to cover the residue.</p>
    <p id="b477-6" data-blocks='[["BL_477.6",477,[196,896,1167,1291]]]'>If then the applications filed in the names of John and James Fox described the land purchased from the Commonwealth with reasonable certainty, they were notice to subsequent warrantees of the application of so much of the public domain. The calls in the warrant to John Fox for well-known surveys, and the location of James Fox on a particular side of John Fox, was sufficient notice of the purchase of the body embraced in the two warrants. It was a full compliance with the requirements of the law, on the part of the holder of these descriptive warrants, if, within a reasonable time, he proceeded to locate them upon the <em>body </em>of land purchased and if the exterior lines of such location agreed with the description in the warrants as a whole, subsequent warrantees may not object that the interior division is not in accordance with the applications filed. If the holder of a junior warrant has notice of the appropriation of the whole body, it is all that he can ask, and he must leave the division of the territory so appropriated to those to whom it belongs; and so far as concerns this principle, a descriptive warrant, or two or more descriptive warrants which upon their face describe the whereabouts of a quantity of land purchased from the state, must of necessity have the same effect as the actual survey of the exterior lines of a large body of lands upon indescriptive warrants belonging to the same person or a company; for the reason, that in the one case, the description filed, and in the other, the survey of the exterior lines of the body of lands, constitute notice and become the inception of title. Upon no other principle, can the difference between a descriptive and an indescriptive warrant, as to the periods at which title commences under them respectively, be sustained. In these, as in many other instances known to the law, notice becomes the foundation of right.</p>

The law of such warrants is, that if surveyed in reasonable time on the land designated or referred to in them, the title commences, by relation, from the date of the warrants. If, however, though surveyed in reasonable time, they be laid on other land than that which they call for, they become what is termed shifted warrants, and title under them commences only from the return of the surveys into the land-office. Younger warrants, surveyed on the same land, and returned before the surveys of such shifted warrants, take precedence of them and constitute the better title. The reason given in the cases, for this postponement of the older <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>and descriptive warrant is, that the contract, in consequence of the descriptiveness of the warrant, having attached to the lands described, cannot be changed, by the owner of it, to other lands, until the Commonwealth, through its officers, assents to the change, by accepting the survey.

In accordance with this rule, the location of James Fox must be determined by that of John Fox, which was the lead<a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>ing warrant.

They say that the marks on the ground show that the exterior lines of this body had been run — that the interior or division line between the two tracts was not run, and that they were under no necessity to run or mark it — and that those exterior lines do bound on both the Mordecai Massey and the Jacob Shuler surveys, the latter of which is understood to be one of the body known as the Fowler lands. The result of this position is, that James Fox, as returned into the land office, lies on the east of John Fox, instead of the north; but the plaintiffs’ remedy that, by changing the division line between the two Fox tracts, from a line north and south to a line east and west. They feel free to take so great a liberty with that line, because it was not actually run on the ground, and because a man having a body of 800 acres of land has a right to divide it as he pleases. So divided, John Fox would answer all its calls, and James Fox would lie at the north of John.

    <p id="b481-7" data-blocks='[["BL_481.7",481,[155,583,1159,385]]]'>This entry would import that the application was made, and the purchase-money paid by one person, who may have been either John or James Fox, but afterward the applications themselves were given in evidence. They were dated December 16th 1793, and were on the same paper, which accounts for their having the same number on the blotter in the receiver-general’s office, but the paper is called “Application James <em>and </em>John Fox.” Then follows the application of each for his respective warrant, and the usual attestation of two justices, that the land was vacant.</p>
    <p id="b481-8" data-blocks='[["BL_481.8",481,[158,969,1155,87]]]'>July 25th 1799. Patent to James Fox, recorded in Centre county, January 17th 1810.</p>
    <p id="b481-9" data-blocks='[["BL_481.9",481,[199,1056,665,41]]]'>Same date. Patent to John Fox, Sr.</p>
    <p id="b481-10" data-blocks='[["BL_481.10",481,[152,1100,1162,169]]]'>March 24th 1817. Will of James Fox, authorizing his executors to sell and dispose of his lands, &amp;c., and dividing the residue of his estate between his step-son, David Morgan, and the heirs of his deceased brother, John Fox.</p>
    <p id="b481-11" data-blocks='[["BL_481.11",481,[154,1272,1160,84]]]'>Assessments of taxes against James Fox were shown from 1818, and against John Fox from 1801.</p>
    <p id="b481-12" data-blocks='[["BL_481.12",481,[155,1358,1159,84]]]'>Now, do these facts warrant the assumption that John Fox took and paid for both warrants ?</p>
    <p id="b481-13" data-blocks='[["BL_481.13",481,[151,1443,1163,759]]]'>The blotter, which at most is only <em>primd facie </em>evidence of who pays, is as good evidence that James paid as that John paid. It is probable, that one paid for both, but it is impossible, from this entry, to determine the ownership of the money. The continued separation of the titles during the lives of the Foxes, and until James devised a moiety to the heirs of John, is a strong indication of original separation. And the legal presumptions arising from lapse of time point the same way. In Strimpfler <em>v. </em>Roberts, 6 <em>Harris </em>302, it was decided, on great consideration, and reaffirmed in Brock <em>v. </em>Savage, 7 <em>Casey </em>421, that where a warrant is issued to one person, and the purchase-money is paid by another, and the patent is afterwards taken out by the nominal warrantee, the right of him who paid the purchase-money is gone, unless he takes possession of the land, or brings ejectment to recover it, within twenty-one years from the date of the warrant; and after that lapse of time he cannot recover, no matter how clearly he may be able to prove that the legal owner was in the beginning a trustee for him.</p>
    <p id="b481-14" data-blocks='[["BL_481.14",481,[150,2213,1160,217]]]'>It was not proved that John Fox paid the purchase-money for the James Fox warrant, but, in view of this principle, what boots it if he did? The patent of 1799 vested the legal title in James, and even though he was trustee for John, the equities of the latter were gone after twenty-one years of non-claim.</p>
    <p id="b482-5" data-blocks='[["BL_482.5",482,[292,414,1164,689]]]'>
      <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>■ These are the reasons why the ground on which the plaintiff’s counsel built up their very ingenious argument cannot be conceded to them. We cannot treat the warrants of 1794 as belonging to one man, and the 800 acres of land covered by them, as his exclusive property. The proofs in the case do not permit us to do so, whilst the presumptions which the law is wont to make in behalf of paper titles, compel us to regard these warrants as separate properties, belonging originally to the respective owners whose names they bear. So regarding them, it appears that they were not located according to their calls, and were consequently returned as shifted warrants, the title under which must be held to have originated when the returns were accepted. But before that time, that part of the land covered by them which is in controversy in this suit, had been taken away by the warrants and surveys under which the defendants claim, and therefore the plaintiffs had no right to. a verdict.</p>
    <p id="b482-6" data-blocks='[["BL_482.6",482,[297,1103,1157,170]]]'>• We think the will of James Pox gave his executors power to sell the land he held under his warrant of 1794, and hence there was no error in admitting in evidence the deed from the executors to David Morgan.</p>
    <p id="b482-7" data-blocks='[["BL_482.7",482,[296,1274,1158,86]]]'>As the case was tried, we think there was no error in withholding it from the jury, and directing a verdict for defendants.</p>
    <p id="b482-8" data-blocks='[["BL_482.8",482,[963,1359,449,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
