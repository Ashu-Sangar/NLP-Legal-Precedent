But it is not less true or well established, that the authority of an agent will be measured not only by his written or oral instructions, but by the acts and declarations of the principal, and consequently, by the acts and declarations of the agent, when known to and tacitly or expressly adopted by the principal. An agent entrusted with the possession of personal property, and with the powers necessary for its safe keeping, acquires no additional power by alleging that he is also armed with a power to sell; and those who buy on the faith of such an allegation, must submit to the loss if it turns out to be unfounded. But if the principal ratify one such sale, by receiving the purchase money, or in any other way, without communicating and protesting against the excess of authority, and still more, if he approve and adopt other sales of the same nature, he will lose the right to allege that the agent has not the authority, which he claims, and will be as much bound by his acts as if they were duly authorized. The policy <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>of insurance, in the case now before us, was made on the 15th of October 1847, for the term of one year from the period of its execution, ‘ and also for the full end and term of any further time or times for which a premium of insurance shall be paid and endorsed on the policy, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the secretary or other authorized officer of the corporation for the time being.’ Endorsed on the policy, or given in the form of separate memoranda, are a series of receipts reaching as far back as October 14th 1848, and coming down regularly, through each succeeding year, to the 15th of October 1856, all acknowledging the payment of premiums in renewal of the insurance, and all signed by <em>J. </em>Minor, as agent for the company. The loss happened shortly after the last of these renewals, and the only question is, whether Minor was an authorized officer of the company, within the terms of the policy, and entitled to bind them by receiving the premium, for the purpose of extending the insurance for another year.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b226-5" data-blocks='[["BL_226.6",226,[285,1136,1160,1286]],["BL_227.1",227,[206,428,1159,259]]]'>“ The question thus propounded has a double aspect, and depends not only on the authority which the company actually gave, but on that which the plaintiff was justified in believing them to have given. The evidence on the former point, consists in the answers of Minor to the interrogations propounded by the defendants’ counsel, and in the written documents annexed to those answers, and containing the instructions under which he acted. The answers throw but little light on the point in question, and the instructions are at the best ambiguous. The third instruction is the only one which speaks of renewals, and all that it says is, that all insurances whether new or renewed, and also all changes, or endorsements on policies, shall be reported daily. Hence an argument that all renewals were to be reported to the defendants for approval, and were not to be binding unless approved. But the document itself contains nothing about approval or disapproval ; it simply requires the agent to acquaint his principals with the acts done in the course of the agency, one of the first duties of an agent, and certainly not the less incumbent upon him, when his acts are binding on the principal, than when they are voidable or merely void. From the duty of reporting renewals, no just inference can therefore be drawn against the authority of the agent to renew. On the contrary, it might be asked, if he could not renew, what occasion or necessity could arise for reporting renewals. Ambiguous language should always be construed most strongly against the party who uses it, especially when it has been the means of leading others into error ; and an insurance company, which introduces a provision into the policy, that the insurance may be renewed by its duly authorized agents, and then gives its agent a letter of instructions requiring him to report all renewals, has little right to complain, if the agent and those who deal with <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>him infer, that he has power to do that which he is authorized and required to report daily, if and when done. Where the language of a power is ambiguous, it should receive that interpretation which will sustain the acts of those who exercise it, although a critical consideration might show reasons for preferring a different interpretation: Very <em>v. </em>Levy, <a href="/us/54/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 How. 345" data-case-ids="3361725" data-case-paths="/us/54/0345-01">13 <em>How. </em>345</a>, 359.</p>

When the policy was about to expire, towards the close of the first year of its existence, the plaintiff called on Minor, then, as now, acting as the agent of the defendants, and paid him the premium for renewing the policy for the ensuing year, and Minor not only accepted the premium, but endorsed it on the policy, writing -his name, at the same time, under a printed acknowledgment that the policy had been renewed. A similar payment was made, and a similar acknowledgment given in each succeeding year, until the year 1856, when the renewal took place which gave rise to the present controversy. That these acts of the agent were binding if done under a previous express or implied authority, or sustained by a subsequent ratification, is beyond doubt or question; and we think there is abundant evidence both of authority and ratification implied unequivocally, and therefore not. less conclusive than if expressly given.</p>

Will it be said, that the defendants remained in ignorance of the several renewals of this policy, from the time of the first renewal, on the 10th of October 1849, down to that of the last, on the 30th October 1856 ? They could not have been ignorant, unless Minor committed a breach of trust by withholding the premiums and appropriating them to his own purposes ; and although there is no direct evidence that he paid them over during the first four or five years, yet he is proved to have paid them in 1855 and 1856, and a letter written by their secretary, October 30th 1856, shows that the company were fully aware that the policy had remained in force down to that period, and only objected to its further continuance. As it had not on any occasion <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>been renewed by them, as they had not done any single act in the interval to give it fresh life and vigor, they must necessarily have known that it was renewed by their agent; and as they have given no evidence of his keeping back or misappropriating the consideration of the renewals, the fair inference is, that it was paid over when and as received, in the due course of business.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b228-6" data-blocks='[["BL_228.6",228,[288,675,1161,1072]]]'>“ The evidence is therefore overwhelming, that the company authorized, knew of, and ratified the renewals of the policy by Minor, and the defendants seek to escape from the only conclusion to be drawn from the evidence, by alleging, first, that although Minor had authority to effect renewals, those renewals were to be merely conditional, and to depend for their validity on the subsequent approval of the company, and next, that whatever his authority might have been originally, it was changed or limited by the letter of February 10th 1855, in which he is requested to limit his transactions on behalf of the company to ordinary risks, and reject all other insurances, whether new or renewed. To judge correctly of the former of these allegations, we must remember that the form of renewals signed by Minor, which is set forth in the policy as originally executed by the defendants, and which may therefore be presumed to have been approved by them, contains nothing conditional, and is, on the contrary, so worded as to import an absolute and final agreement. The policy does not say, that the insurance may be conditionally renewed by any authorized agent, subject to the approval or disapproval of the company, and. to continue in force until they signify their disapprobation. It says, that the insurance shall endure ‘ for the full end and term of any future time or times for which a premium shall be paid and endorsed on the policy, or otherwise acknowledged in writing, by the secretary or other authorized officer of the corporation.’</p>

'The question, therefore, is simply whether a principal, who has said that he will be bound absolutely, if certain payments are made to any one who is duly authorized to receive them, can with propriety enjoy the benefit of a series of such payments, made to one assuming to act as his agent, and escape from liability when it suits his purpose, on the ground that if the agent was authorized at all, his authority was limited, and did not extend to an absolute contract. Notice is, for most purposes, equivalent to knowledge, and whatever puts a man on inquiry operates as notice. A principal, who receives the consideration of a contract, made by one who assumes <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>to act as Ms agent, ought to inquire into the nature of the contract ; if he fails to do so, he must submit to the consequences, and will not be allowed to treat that as conditional, which is really absolute. Moreover, the form of renewal, as set forth in the policy as originally executed by the defendants, is such as would lead the insured to suppose, that if the insurance were renewed at all, it would be renewed absolutely, and made it the duty of the insurers to inquire whether the insured was not acting on the expectations thus created, and whether he knew of the limited instructions given to Minor, if indeed, any such limitation existed. The general rule, that a principal will be bound, not only by the authority which he actually gives, but by that which he leads others to believe he has given, is too well settled to be questioned as a general principle; and was held in Perkins <em>¶. </em>The Washington Insurance Co., 4 <em>Cowen </em>660, to render the insurers liable, when they might otherwise have escaped from liability.</p>

      <em>“ </em>It would seem equally plain, that the letter of February 10th 1855, was not such a revocation or restriction of the powers previously given to Minor, as would render the renewal of October 14th 1856, void or voidable. It instructs him to confine future renewals to ordinary risks, but it does not preclude the exercise of his judgment, nor deny Mm the power of determining what risks were ordinary and what extraordinary; no doubt, because some discretion was necessary for the effectual discharge of his functions, as an agent at a distance from his principals. Nor is there any sufficient evidence, that the risk covered by this policy, was so far extraordinary as to fall within the restriction ; for although tanneries are enumerated at the close of the policy among specific risks, yet the policy itself informs us that some only of those risks involved extra hazard, while the original insurance and all the subsequent renewals, were effected at ordinary rates of premium. Nor, if the letter in question had been a revocation of the authority previously held by Minor, would it be binding on the plaintiff, in the absence of evidence that it was made known to him, or that he had in some way notice of its contents. An agent who has been endowed with a general authority, and allowed to hold himself out to third persons as expressly or impliedly authorized to represent his principal, cannot be stripped of his power subsequently by a secret act of revocation, unknown to those who continue to deal with him, in the belief that everything remains as it was previously: Morgan <em>v. </em>Stell, <em><a href="/binn/5/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Binn. 305" data-case-ids="1793622" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0305-01">5 Binn. </a></em><a href="/binn/5/0305-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Binn. 305" data-case-ids="1793622" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0305-01">305</a>; Beard <em>v. </em>Kirk, 11 <em>N.

To hold that persons who relied with reason upon the acquiescence of the defendants, during a long series of years, in the acts of Minor, could be prejudiced by a change in his instructions, not communicated to them, and which they had no means of knowing, would be contrary to one of the plainest principles of justice, which prescribes that those <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>•who give others a right to believe that a particular state of things exists, shall be equally bound whether it exists or not. On the whole, we are of opinion that no sufficient reason has been shown for a new trial, and that judgment should be entered for the plaintiff on the point reserved.”</p>

The policy was dated 20th October 1847, and contained a provision that it should have no force or effect <em>“ </em>if assigned, unless such assignment be made within thirty days after the transfer of the property, and allowed by the company agreeably -to Article XI. of the proposals annexed,” which is in these words: “ XI. The policy may always be transferred, provided such transfer be endorsed upon the policy, and brought to the office for approval, within thirty days from the date thereof; otherwise the premium shall be considered as sunk, for the benefit of the assurers.” By Article VII., “ all persons desirous of continuing their insurances may do so, by a timely payment of the <em>premium only, </em>without being subject to any charge for the policy.’</p>
    <p id="b230-10" data-blocks='[["BL_230.12",230,[307,1890,1156,470]]]'>The policy was “ to the full end and term of one year, and also for the full end and term of any future time or times for which a premium of insurance shall be paid and endorsed on this policy, or otherwise acknowledged in writing by the secretary, or other authorized officer of the said corporation, for the time being;” and it was agreed “ that this policy shall expire at twelve o’clock, at noon, on the thirteenth day of October, in the year one thousand eight hundred and forty-eight, unless continued by endorsement or acknowledgment as aforesaid, and then at the time shall expire, according to the tenor of the said endorsement or acknowledgment.”</p>

On the 25th October 1848, an additional insurance of $275 was made, and the premium $2.75 paid to and acknowledged by Mr. Minor.</p>
    <p id="b231-5" data-blocks='[["BL_231.6",231,[204,576,1158,345]]]'>On the 9th January 1854, the policy was assigned by John Waughn to John P. Massey, the plaintifl' below, and approved in due form by the agent of the company, John Minor. After this transfer, thus allowed, three premiums were received for its continuance, by the agent, and transmitted to and received by the parent office at Philadelphia. One was received on the 12th October 1854, one in 1855, and the last on the 14th October 1856, and all were duly acknowledged in writing by their agent.</p>
    <p id="b231-6" data-blocks='[["BL_231.7",231,[202,920,1162,474]]]'>A loss by fire occurred on the night of the 11th November 1856, and about it or its amount there was no dispute. By the payment of the last premium, the policy was continued for one year from the 13th October 1856, and of course covered this loss. From the course of business, and from necessity, the agent at Fredericksburg was clearly an authorized officer of the said corporation, for the time being, with power to receive premiums for continuances, and, by his acknowledgment in writing, to bind the company for another year. It, therefore, lies on the company to show that this agent had no such power, and that such want of power was communicated to, or known by the plaintiff below.</p>
    <p id="b231-7" data-blocks='[["BL_231.8",231,[205,1393,1160,171]]]'>All the previous acts of Mr. Minor had received the approval of the company, and we can see nothing in the evidence which was in any way likely to put the holder of the policy upon inquiry, as to the nature and extent of his authority.</p>

Neither of these letters were exhibited to Mr. Massey, and the printed instructions, which were not followed by the agent in some important matters, if shown to him, contained nothing affecting his standing in this case. By the II. Instruction, “ all insurances, whether new or renewed, also all changes or endorsements on policies to be reported daily.” This was never followed. Under the XI. Instruction, about monthly accounts, Mr. Minor, at the close of October 1856, sent his October account, containing the premium received by him for its renewal on the 14th of the same month.</p>

    <p id="b232-5" data-blocks='[["BL_232.6",232,[275,627,1157,214]]]'>“I should, therefore,” says Mr. Minor, “send you a check for the premium, but having a few days ago transmitted to Philadelphia all the funds in my hands, belonging to the agency, and my private stock being insufficient for the purpose, I shall have to put it off for a few days.”</p>
    <p id="b232-6" data-blocks='[["BL_232.7",232,[274,840,1155,173]]]'>On the 11th November, Mr. Minor wrote, from Fredericksburg, a letter to Mr. Massey, at Bowling Green, enclosing his check for the premium, $34.20, which could not reach, by course of mail, its destination, before the 13th November, at 2 o’clock, p. M.</p>
    <p id="b232-7" data-blocks='[["BL_232.8",232,[274,1014,1158,171]]]'>It is clear, therefore, on their own construction of their contract, the property remained insured until the 13th November; and as the fire happened on the night of the 11th, or the morning of the 12th, the company are, of course, liable for the loss.</p>
    <p id="b232-8" data-blocks='[["BL_232.9",232,[276,1185,1151,82]]]'>The form of action was right, and we see no error in the rulings of the court below, or in their decision upon the demurrer.</p>
    <p id="b232-9" data-blocks='[["BL_232.10",232,[272,1269,1157,345]]]'>Upon the simple facts of this case, we cannot see that there was any real ground to dispute the liability of the company, and in all such instances, it is the true interest of the insurers to pay, without the costs and trouble of a law suit. In England, in a kindred branch of assurance, “ the Equitable boasts that it has never, but in two instances, disputed a claim, out of its numerous and vast engagements.” This is remarkable for a society that has paid away, in all forms, twenty-nine millions sterling.</p>
