Two chandeliers were screwed into pipes in the ceiling of the parlour, and the joints were covered with cement; the brackets were screwed into the pipes in the wall and cemented— this being the common and usual mode of fastening gas-pipes.</p>

On the 21st, notice was given to the defendant, to quit the premises, at the expiration of three months.

There is no trace of a contrary doctrine in the English decisions, nor does it appear that the ordinary apparatus for lighting has ever been classed among fixtures.</p>
    <p id="b523-10" data-blocks='[["BL_523.12",523,[172,1080,1157,298]]]'>This is still the law; but it is supposed that the introduction of carburetted hydrogen gas may have changed the character of the apparatus, because it must be connected with the pipes through which the gaseous fluid is brought into the building. If such were the case, it would establish two different rules in relation to the same subject, depending entirely upon the medium used to produce light.</p>
    <p id="b523-11" data-blocks='[["BL_523.13",523,[164,1379,1186,673]]]'>The first gas-works were established in London, fifty years ago; and in 1835, the first ordinance was passed by the city of Philadelphia for their erection, since which period they have been gradually introduced into the cities, towns, and villages of the interior. The pipes connect with the street main, and are now carried up through the walls and ceilings of the house, with openings at the points where it is intended to attach fixtures, for the purpose of lighting the rooms and entries. These are called » gas-fittings; whilst the chandeliers, and other substitutes for the / oil lamps and candles, are called gas-fixtures, and are screwed on| to the pipes and cemented, only to prevent the escape of gas; and (may be removed at pleasure, without injury either to the fittings, or to the freehold. . There is, therefore, really nothing to distinguish this new apparatus from the old lamps, candlesticks, and chandeliers, which have always been considered as personal chattels.</p>
    <p id="b523-12" data-blocks='[["BL_523.14",523,[173,2062,1155,301]]]'>Gas-stoves are largely used for bath, and other rooms, and are necessarily connected with the gas pipes in the same way; but no one would think of saying that they were fixtures, which it would be waste to remove. It is, therefore, more simple to consider all these gas-fixtures, whether stoves, chandeliers, hall and entry lamps, drop-lights, or table-lamps, as governed by the same rule as the articles for which they are substituted.</p>

In Lawrence <em>v. </em>Kemp, 1 <em>Duer’s Reports (Superior Court of New York) </em>363, it was decided that gas-fixtures, when placed by a tenant in a shop or store, although fastened to the building, are not fixtures as between landlord and tenant; and in Wall <em>v. </em>Hinds, <a href="/mass/70/0256-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Gray 256" data-case-ids="2075514" data-case-paths="/mass/70/0256-01">4 <em>Gray </em>256</a>, <em>the </em>Supreme Court of Massachusetts held that a lessee could take away gas-pipes put in by him into a house leased to him for a hotel, and passing from the cellar through the floors' and partitions, and kept in place in the rooms by metal bands, though some of them passed through wooden ornaments of the ceiling,which were cut away for their removal.</p>
    <p id="b524-6" data-blocks='[["BL_524.6",524,[302,904,1163,513]]]'>The case now before us seems to have been directly decided, in Montague <em>v. </em>Dent, 10 <em>Richardson (S. Carolina Law Reports) </em>135, in December 1856, <em>by </em>the Court of Appeals of South Carolina. Under a sale to foreclose a mortgage, a house and lot were sold, and a few days afterwards, the sheriff, under executions against the mortgagor, removed and sold certain gas-chandeliers, and pendent hall gas-burners, and the court held unanimously, that they were not fixtures which passed to the purchaser of the real estate by the conveyance of the freehold. The reasoning of the court appears to us to be decisive of the present case, the only-difference being that the house here, was sold under a judgment, and not under a mortgage.</p>

    <p id="b524-8" data-blocks='[["BL_524.8",524,[298,1757,1161,559]]]'>By referring to the Senate Journal of 1855, it appears that the first section of this bill was amended in the Senate, by striking out all after the word “to” in the seventh line, and inserting in lieu thereof the words as follow, viz.: “ plumbing, gas-fitting, furnaces, and furnace buildings” (p. 167); and upon the passage of the bill, by the unanimous consent of the Senate, it was amended in the first section, by striking out of the eighth line the words “ furnaces, and furnace buildings,” and by inserting in lieu thereof, the words “ and furnishing, and erection of grates and furnaces.” Notwithstanding, therefore, the punctuation of the act, the word “gas-fitting” stands alone, the furnishing and erection of. grates and furnaces relating to an entirely different subject.</p>
