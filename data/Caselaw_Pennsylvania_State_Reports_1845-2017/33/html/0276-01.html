Bickley sold certain premises on the south side of Walnut street, between Third and Fourth streets, in the city of Philadelphia, to the defendants in this bill in equity.

The rule of <em>caveat emptor </em>applies to sucha sale, and the purchaser would take the land subject to any ground-rent upon it, and to any conditions under which it was held by the decedent: Sackett <em>v. </em>Twining, 6 <em>Harris </em>199.</p>
