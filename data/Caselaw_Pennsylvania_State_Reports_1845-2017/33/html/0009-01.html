The present rules of the Girard College admit as orphans, within the meaning of Mr. Girard’s will, none but children who have lost both parents. Are these rules consonant to the intent of the testator; and if so, are those rules repugnant to any principle of law ? In the absence of judicial decisions, we must resort to law dictionaries, compiled by men of acknowledged learning and research, as furnishing the best authority attainable. <em>Bouvier </em>(2 <em>vol.

The custom of London, which is relied upon as supporting this construction, shows that the practical meaning held by the Orphans’ Court of that city, was, that an orphan, within the jurisdiction of that court, was a child who had lost either parent. For, if any man or <em>ivoman, </em>free of the city of London, died, leaving children within <a id="p14" href="#p14" data-label="14" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*14</a>age, a court of record, composed of the mayor and aldermen of the city, had the custody of the persons, lands, and chattels of such orphans: <em>Wood’s Inst. </em>532; <em>Macpherson on Infants </em>48.

Mr. Girard, a native Frenchman, spoke much French, and better than English, throughout his whole life. It is possible, therefore, that though his will is drawn up in English, the word orphan presented itself to his mind with that meaning which <em>orphelin </em>has in French, because if two languages are equally ready to a mind, as means of thought and utterance, which is much more than the capacity of speaking two languages, phenomena take place in the human mind, which can be known by personal experience only. Sometimes we think in one language, sometimes in another: sometimes we use one language, and yet <em>i </em>transplant to certain words the meaning which belongs to their fellow words in the other language. We must then take the word orphan in its English or French sense, if we wish to ascertain its precise meaning, as to the will in question, <em>and in both languages, the word orphan, in common language, means a fatherless child, </em>as the following note and the succeeding lines will show; it never means anything different, if used to designate asylums, or any institutions for them.

In our country, as I have been informed by some of the first jurists” (Chancellor Kent and Judge Story), “ it is believed that no such official decisions exist, but that the meaning attached to the word orphan, by the people at large, is unquestionably that of a fatherless child— a meaning which entirely agrees with our whole social system. I am fully aware of the paramount importance of the mother in the education of a child; this importance even increases the farther we descend in the scale of social relations. I have enlarged upon this point in another work. But our whole social system would be overturned, were we no longer to consider the father the chief of the house, the <em>‘ </em>lord’ of the family! In all civilized countries, the law justly takes cognisance of the death of a father; it appoints guardians, it administers the property of the minors, and watches over their interests; but in no country does the law take cognisance of the death of the mother only, except in some special cases, where her property has been kept separately.
