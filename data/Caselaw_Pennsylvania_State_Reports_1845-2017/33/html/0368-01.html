The back building on the part now owned by the plaintiff, fronted south, and all the doors, with eighteen windows, opened on that side. It had an open space of about twenty feet on that side, between it and the next building on the south. On the north side, a number of windows also opened, on the part of the lot now owned by the defendant. On the defendant’s part of the lot there were also erected a back building, the doors and windows of which fronted the plaintiff’s lot.</p>
