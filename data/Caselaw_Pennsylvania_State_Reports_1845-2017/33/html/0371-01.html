The dissolution was advertised. On the 19th January 1854, Hess was indebted to Acheson, Rommel &amp; Fry in the sum of $10,359.04 for advances by acceptance or endorsement. No change was made in the books of the firm, but they were continued without alteration, as if Fry had not retired.</p>

No change wa,s made in the account from 1851 to 1855; it was an open running account, with balances struck at intervals. In March 1855, Hess was indebted, on this account, to Acheson <em>k </em>Rommell, in $4647.21.</p>

Hess immediately and repeatedly requested the plaintiffs, by letter, to remove this judgment, as it affected his credit; and on the 16th July 1855, requested from them a further advance of $1500, adding that they need not he afraid, as the judgment was on his property, which was worth double.</p>

Besides, the evidence showed that nothing was due on this judgment. The copy of the entries taken in full, from the books of Acheson, Rommel &amp; Fry, and the books of Acheson &amp; Rommel, given in evidence below by the defendants and attached to the record, show a continuous running account of debit and credit items. The successive payments or credits applied to the discharge of the items of debt antecedently due in the order of time, as they stand in the account, and balances struck from time to time, show actual appropriation by Acheson &amp; Rommel of the several payments made by Hess to the discharge of the balance due the firm of Acheson, Rommel &amp; Fry, and the extinguishment of such balance, long prior to the sale of Hess’s real estate by the sheriff. If no such appropriation had been made, the law would have made such appropriation: <em>Story’s Eq., </em>459 a; <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20328" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 328">3 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>328</a>; <em>Collyer on Part. </em>547-8, 553. That interest cannot be allowed upon a judgment out of the proceeds of a sheriff’s sale, accruing after such sale, and whilst the money is in court and being distributed, we think it is so clear and well decided, that it only could have been permitted by the court below, by overlooking that exception to the auditor’s report.</p>

Christian Shenk, the judgment-creditor, entitled to payment next after Acheson 6 Rommel, and the appellant in this case, became the purchaser of the property of Benjamin Hess at sheriff’s sale, and still continues to hold the same.

The auditor upon the facts, has found that it should bear interest, being in the hands of, and used by Shenk ever since the sale. He has found that to have been the agreement, and we do not think his finding can be disturbed.</p>

The equity of the claim of Acheson &amp; Rommel is very clear. If their opponents want strict law, then we start with a judgment of Acheson, Rommel &amp; Fry against Hess for $10,000, and they have to show that this was paid, wholly or partially, or that in equity it is wholly or partially discharged. In strict law there has been no payment, and there was none intended to be. The relief against the judgment, if improperly used for its legal amount, belongs to equity.</p>
    <p id="b374-8" data-blocks='[["BL_374.10",374,[316,1162,1154,473]]]'>Now, Hess’s creditors have no more right to relief than Hess himself, and he has no more than is allowed in the auditor’s report. He owed the firm, when Fry left it, over $10,000. Has he any equity to claim that all this is paid, and that the judgment to secure it is discharged by reason of his subsequent dealings with Acheson &amp; Rommel? Not at all; for all those dealings were manifestly continued on the basis of the judgment-bond. And if this did not appear, it would be quite equitable to apply the payments made to Acheson &amp; Rommel, to the debts due to them and not secured, rather than to the debt due to Acheson, Rommel &amp; Fry, which was secured.</p>
