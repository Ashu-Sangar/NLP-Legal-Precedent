This is the only question in the cause. Deeds and other written instruments are not to be disturbed, unless the evidence to change them is clear, distinct, and indubitable. They are solemn instruments — they cannot lie — they are the instruments of our title — do not depend on the frail memory of man — and to set them aside, on loose or unsatisfactory evidence, would produce unheard of confusion and disaster. But if you are satisfied that Kissel was to have until the next Monday, it was part and parcel of the contract — and your verdict should be for the defendants. On the other hand, if you believe that the bargain was concluded when the agreement was written and signed, then your verdict' should be for the plaintiff, for the undivided half part of the tract of land in controversy.”</p>
