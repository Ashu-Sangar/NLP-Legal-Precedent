Brick. These mortgages were for part of the purchase-money of the two lots.</p>

The plaintiffs gave in evidence the two mortgages, and the assignment of one of them to Brick, and there rested. The defendant, after giving in evidence various receipts, notes, checks, acceptances, and letters, showing payments to Richardson and Brick, on account of the two mortgages, produced and offered in evidence the following check :—</p>

    <p id="b236-16" data-blocks='[["BL_236.18",236,[250,2039,1153,84]]]'>To the admission of this check the plaintiffs objected, because it was not shown on what account it was paid.</p>

When there is but one single transaction to which a payment can be referred, the law necessarily appropriates it to that account, and no other.</p>
