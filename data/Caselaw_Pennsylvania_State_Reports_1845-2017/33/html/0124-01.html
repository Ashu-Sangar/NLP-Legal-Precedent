So long as Race street remained a public highway, and subject to the right of passage on the part of the public, this was a question of little practical moment to the parties, for neither could occupy or use the portion of land in controversy, and which fell within the lines of the street. The street being vacated, the .territory in dispute is thereby thrown open again to private occupancy.

The same effect would follow a certain and immemorial usage. The question here arises, in the first place, on the deed from John Ereedley to defendant ; for it must be remembered that, at that time, the former owned all the land, both tracts, and did not convey the residue to plaintiff until nearly two years after.

It is so unsubstantial, that in country surveys, it usually indicates a corner which the surveyor never visited, and which exists only on paper. Artificial boundaries which are meant to be fixed monuments, are made with more care than merely sticking a stake, which the next wind may blow over, which one of a thousand accidents may destroy, and which must rapidly decay, if not otherwise obliterated. So frail a witness is scarcely worthy to be called a monument, or to control the construction of a deed in so important a particular as that under consideration.</p>

There was no ambiguity on the face of the deed. The question raised was, what were the legal import and significance of the words employed by the parties ? That was a question for the court, and not for the jury. The jury were no more to measure the legal effect of these terms, than they would be permitted to judge of words of inheritance or perpetuity in a deed.</p>
    <p id="b130-10" data-blocks='[["BL_130.10",130,[286,1774,1158,557]]]'>The intention of the parties, as deduced from the language of the instrument, was the criterion of construction, and in making that deduction, the court would look at the circumstances in which the conveyance was made — at the fact that Mr. Freedley might naturally desire to retain the proprietorship of Race street for the protection of the head-race of his mill; and on the other hand, that Cox was buying town property with reference to surrounding streets. In reference to Freedley’s interest in the head-race of his mill, the principle decided in Seybert <em>v. </em>Levan, 8 <em>Barr </em>383, should not be lost sight of, in settling the construction of the deed; for if he retained the right to enter for repairs notwithstanding his conveyance, there would be less reason for restricting the descriptive words to the margin of the street.</p>
