Williams, in right of his wife, setting forth that Henry Naglee, the father of the said Emily A.'Williams, by his will, proved on the 23d February 1838, devised certain real estate, in the county of Philadelphia, to the said Emily A. Williams, when she should attain the age of twenty-one years. That the testator left a widow Mary E. Naglee, whom he appointed sole executrix, and four daughters, one of whom was the petitioner, who was then about the age of thirty years, and was married to George W. Williams in 1844. That the said Emily had had three children, all of whom were dead.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b89-11" data-blocks='[["BL_89.11",89,[179,1653,1157,386]]]'>That by his will, the testator empowered his executrix to bargain and sell, by public or private sale, and to let on ground-rent, the lots devised to his daughter Emily. That the said executrix, in pursuance of the said power, had let the said premises to different persons, reserving ground-rents payable to herself and her heirs, to the use of the said Emily A. Williams, under and by the authority of said will. That one of the said ground-rents had been redeemed, and the proceeds invested in a bond and mortgage of John Witzell, payable in the same manner.</p>

If the will created a fee simple, then the trust is ended by the conveyance and reservation of the ground-rents ; and the legal title is already in Mrs. Williams: Kuhn <em>v. </em>Newman, 2 <em>Casey </em>227; Whichcote <em>v. </em>Lyle, 4 <em>Id. </em>73.</p>

According to the actual intent, this could hardly be said. Though a fee be given in the first instance, it is very common that it is reduced by later words, and thus innumerable fees tail are created. Here she is to enjoy the rents and profits for life only, by express words; with remainder to her <em>children, </em>after her death, in fee simple, to them “ and their heirs.” It is competent for a testator to do this ; it only needs the actual intent, and here it is : Ellet <em>v. </em>Paxson, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20420" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 420">2 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>420</a>; Stewart <em>v. </em>Kenower, 7 <em>Id. </em>288; Bumberger <em>v. </em>Clippinger, 5 <em>Id. </em>311; Hallowell <em>v. </em>Phipps, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Whart.%20380" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Whart. 380">2 </a><em><a href="/citations/?q=2%20Whart.%20380" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Whart. 380">Wh. 380</a>; </em>2 <em>Jarm. on </em>

We still think so. The principal devising clause gives her a fee simple expressly. How is this reduced to a life estate ? Certainly not by the direction that she shall not sell or convey; for this is a void restraint upon an absolute title, as we showed before.</p>

    <p id="b91-11" data-blocks='[["BL_91.15",91,[200,1371,1158,431]]]'>This is not inconsistent with the fee granted before; for it provides only for a <em>division </em>of the estate among her heirs on her death; for the word “ survivors” of her sisters, includes the children of a sister not surviving. It therefore gives her an estate of inheritance, describing the line of inheritance according to the intestate act, first to her issue, and second to her collateral heirs on the side of the testator. In principle, the devise is the same as in Reifsnyder <em>v. </em>Hunter, and Walker <em>v. </em>Vincent, 19 <em>State Rep. </em>41, 369.
