Means, of three undivided fourth parts of “The Hopewell Property,” for the consideration of $15,000. The plaintiff alleged that the defendant, at the time of the conveyance, agreed with the Millikens, that they should have the privilege of reselling his fourth part of the property, within five years thereafter, and that the surplus, over and above $5000 with interest, and a sufficient sum to compensate the defendant for his trouble and expense in the premises, should belong to the Millikens.

The Millikens refused to sell at that price, except on the condition that they were to have the profit on a resale within five years. This was assented to by the other parties; but the defendant contended that it was a joint contract between the Millikens and all the purchasers, and not a several contract with him.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b519-9" data-blocks='[["BL_519.9",519,[179,1254,1163,904]]]'>Answer. — “We refuse to answer this as requested, under the evidence in the cause, and have referred in our general charge to the question, upon which the defendant’s right to recover must turn.” And in his general charge, the learned judge instructed the jury upon this point as follows: — “ If there was a time fixed within which Milliken had the privilege of selling the property, and to receive all he could sell for, over and above what would pay the respective amounts Thompson, McDowell, and Means had purchased from him for, and if you find that that time was two years from the date of the deed, it had passed, and the plaintiff will not be entitled to recover.

    <p id="b520-12" data-blocks='[["BL_520.14",520,[279,1835,1161,161]]]'>The court refused to affirm this point, and instructed the jury that the defendant would be liable for whatever Milliken could, at ■any time within the five .years, have sold the property above the indebtedness referred to.</p>

Doubtless, Milliken would have been .entitled to the benefit of the whole period, if he had not voluntarily abbreviated it. When, about four years .and -a third had elapsed, he called on Means to sell <em>now, </em>or allow him to do so, and threatened him with the loss and damage of longer 'delay, did -he not abbreviate it ? Could he in reason <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>ask anything more of Means than to account for the value of the property on that day ?</p>
    <p id="b521-6" data-blocks='[["BL_521.6",521,[168,518,1159,344]]]'>We think not. Though entitled by his contract to the market for five years, he was not bound to wait for the last day of the period, but might avail himself of the highest price, at any time within the five years. Possibly the best sale could be made a little short of the extremest limit, and the contract, construed most favourably to Milliken, would allow him to take advantage of the very nick of time. He thought so. He construed the bargain in this manner, and accordingly fixed the 1st February 1853.</p>
    <p id="b521-7" data-blocks='[["BL_521.7",521,[168,862,1160,556]]]'>Then, in all reason, the measure of damages ought to have been the difference between the market value of the property on that day, and the indebtedness which Means had a right to retain. More especially is this true, when it is considered that Means, without any fraudulent intent, but probably understanding the contract differently from Milliken, had, on the 8th January 1853, sold and conveyed the property for $5700 — a sum considerably less than the indebtedness, with interest and expenses, which it was the prime object of the arrangement to secure. He could not, of course, bring the property to a sale on the 1st February 1853, but he was called on to answer in this action for its value, and under the circumstances of the ease, he had a right to insist that its value should be ascertained as of that day.</p>
    <p id="b521-8" data-blocks='[["BL_521.8",521,[168,1418,1162,718]]]'>If he had availed himself of the improved market between that day and the 19th October 1853, when the five years would have been out, there would be justice in requiring him to account accordingly, but he did not. It may be said, that he ought to have waited. Perhaps he ought, if the plaintiff had let him alone. But after receiving so imperative a notice he was not bound to take the risk of waiting. Had the market declined after the notice, the consequences of delay would have been his, but having substantially obeyed the call, by offering on this trial to answer for the value of the property on the day fixed by the plaintiff for its sale, it is immaterial whether the property rose or fell after that date. It was virtually taking the plaintiff at his word, and selling the property on the 1st February 1853. Had this been the form of the transaction, nobody would have thought the defendant liable in damages. But although it could not take this form, the 6th point brought the matter substantially to the same test.</p>
    <p id="b521-9" data-blocks='[["BL_521.9",521,[170,2148,1160,128]]]'>The point should have been affirmed, and thus a measure of damages furnished to the jury to apply under the appropriate proofs.</p>
