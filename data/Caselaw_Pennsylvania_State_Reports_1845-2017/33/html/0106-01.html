He received his interest annually from Peter Bowman, and in all respects treated him as the principal.

The whole amount of the money was paid to Peter Bowman, at the time. About two months afterwards, he paid to the plaintiff twenty or twenty-five dollars as a ‘ bonus.’ This was not such a material difference in the contract as would release the security. Indeed, the contract was not changed at all. Peter Bowman received all the money that John D. Bowman agreed to become security for.</p>

The reason for such a rule is obvious. A man may be entirely willing to become the security of another, for one year, for the payment of a sum of money, when he would not for a longer term. Besides, it is the privilege of a surety, to require the payee to proceed upon the note, and enforce its collection at any time after maturity, and for his benefit, and if the payee refuse to do so, he will be discharged. An agreement with the principal to postpone the payment for a specified time, would take away this right belonging to the surety.

The old contract could only be destroyed by the creation of a new one, and therefore it becomes important to ascertain precisely the character of the subsequent arrangement between the parties.

Bowman, deceased, is founded on a promissory note, which he signed jointly with one John Eynon and Peter Bowman, to the plaintiff, for money loaned to Peter. The proof was, that the money was lent on the credit of John D. Bowman; and the jury have found that the other two drawers are insolvent. The creditor’s only chance of recovery, therefore, is against the estate of John D. Bowman, <em>deceased; </em>but as he was a surety, and only jointly bound with the others, it is insisted that, <em>at law, </em>his death terminated the creditor’s right of recourse to his estate.</p>
    <p id="b110-10" data-blocks='[["BL_110.12",110,[297,1227,1160,428]]]'>. Long since, this rule of law has been relaxed in courts of equity, as against joint obligors who all participated in the loan, whether as partners or otherwise; so that if one of the borrowers should die, the creditor has a right to proceed against his estate, without recourse to the joint contractors, and without showing their insolvency: <em>Story's Eq. Juris. </em>§ 163. As against deceased sureties, however, courts of equity refused to relax the rule of law, unless there was evidence that the parties intended to make the obligation joint and several, and made it only joint through mistake: Weaver <em>v. </em>Brotherton, 6 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>262.</p>

The plaintiff lent his money on the faith of John D. Bowman’s credit; and Bowman knew that. His promise to pay was absolute and unconditional. True, he may not have handled any of the money. As between him and his co-promissors, he may have been a mere surety; but without a pledge of his estate, the money would not have been loaned. It is one of the favourite maxims of the law, that where there is a right there is a remedy; but here, according to the strict rule of the common law, there would be a clear right without a remedy. The other promissors, whose credit the plaintiff did not trust, are insolvent — and therefore no remedy can be had against them. The promissor whom he did trust, is dead; and though his estate may be ample to make good all his promises, it shall not be touched by this creditor, because the decedent was only a surety, and not a principal debtor.</p>

If a contract of several persons be joint and not several, a judgment therein against all of them is more essentially joint. Hence, when the legislature prescribe that such a judgment shall no longer be subject merely to the remedy of a joint judgment, but shall be proceeded in as if it were several, did they mean to leave the <em>contract </em>exposed to the old difficulties ? Did they mean to say to the creditor, — If you have sued your joint contract, and obtained a joint judgment, it is several, and the surety is bound the same as if he was a principal; but if you have forborne to sue, or having sued, have not obtained your judgment, the death of the surety releases his estate ? We think not.

And as the death of a surety, after judgment, does not prevent pursuit of his estate, in the same manner as if the contract had been several, so <em>a fortiori </em>his death before or pending suit, shall not prevent such pursuit.</p>
