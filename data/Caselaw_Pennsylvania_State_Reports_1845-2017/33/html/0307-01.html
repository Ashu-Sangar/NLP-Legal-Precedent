    <p class="summary" id="b311-6" data-blocks='[["BL_311.6",311,[210,638,1153,260]]]'>“Another ground of defence is, that the defendant’s intestate was the holder of three promissory notes and a due-bill, amounting in the aggregate to the sum of $7083.41, exclusive of interest, which the defendant alleges are a good and available set-off to the bond in controversy, without reference to the purpose for, or the consideration on which it was given.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b311-7" data-blocks='[["BL_311.7",311,[207,898,1159,643]]]'>“ 1. The first question for consideration is this, viz.: has the defendant shown a good and valid defence to the bond, as against M. Eldred, Jr., the legal plaintiff in this case ? (The court here referred to the receipt given by Eldred to Hazlett, dated the 24th of June, 1852, showing the purpose for which the bond was given), and instructed the jury that no recovery could be had on the bond in favour of Eldred, without the production of the note for $1500, or some evidence impeaching the validity of the receipt; and even if Eldred could recover the amount of the note for fifteen hundred dollars, without its production or accounting for its absence, still the defendant might set off any claims held by his intestate against the said Eldred. The receipt of the 24th of June 1852, and the notes signed by Eldred, and produced by the defendant, to which I have referred, if signed and delivered by Eldred, constitute a good and available defence to this bond, as against Eldred.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b311-8" data-blocks='[["BL_311.8",311,[210,1539,1156,902]],["BL_312.1",312,[264,412,1160,166]]]'>“ 2. Has the defendant shown a good and available defence as against Mrs. Patrick, the assignee of- the judgment ? It is well settled, that the assignee of the bond takes it subject to all the equities which subsisted between the original parties, and that the obligor can set up any defence to the bond in the hands of the assignee, that he could set up to it in the hands of the obligee, at the date of assignment, and notice thereof. So that the defendant can set up any defence to this bond in the hands of Mrs. Patrick, which he could set up to it in the hands of Eldred, unless estopped by some act or thing done by his intestate, from denying its validity. ‘ If an obligor induce a person to take an assignment of his bond, by admitting the justice of the debt, or declaring that he has no defence, he cannot afterwards deny it to the prejudice of the assignee. But in order to create this equitable estoppel, it is necessary for the assignee to show, not only that he took the assignment, but that he paid a valuable consideration for it. If the law were otherwise, an ignorant obligor might easily be trapped into an admission, and a sham assignment might be made for the very purpose of keeping out an honest defence. The assignee must also be able to show that the admission was made <em>before </em>he expended his money in procuring the assignment. Any<a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>thing said afterwards can do no harm, because it could not be his motive for making the purchase, and therefore it shall not affect the other party by way of estoppel:’ Weaver <em>v. </em>Lynch, 1 <em>Casey </em>451.</p>

The bond was first assigned to Nancrede &amp; Ballard, to secure the payment of $5000 — to be reassigned on payment thereof. It was reassigned to Eldred on the 11th of February 1854, who assigned it to Patricks &amp; Friend, on the 13th February 1854 — and also assigned the judgment thereon to Pat-ricks &amp; Friend on the 16th February 1854, as of the 13th, the day on which the bond was assigned.</p>

The defendant alleges that this letter was never signed by Dr. Hazlett — that the signature appended thereto, as the signature of Dr. Hazlett, is a forgery. Whether the alleged signature of Dr. Hazlett is his genuine and proper signature, or whether it be a forgery, as alleged, is a question of 'fact for the determination of the jury, from all the evidence in the cause. (The court here referred to the evidence.) If the jury find that the signature is not the genuine signature of Dr. Hazlett, but that the same is a forgery, the defendant is not estopped from setting up any defence which he may have to the bond, and would be entitled to your verdict— having shown a good defence as against Eldred.

During the negotiation, nothing was said by the parties or either of them (Patrick &amp; Friend and plaintiff’s son), in regard to the letter of Hazlett. It was not, handed over to Mrs. Patrick, or to her son and agent, when the judgment was transferred, and the agent does not say that he purchased the judgment on the faith of the letter of Hazlett — which he did not see until after the controversy in regard to this judgment had arisen, and which was not handed over on its assignment.

We think it is not sustained. A defence to the whole or a portion of the consideration of a bond may be made upon any grounds which may show that, <em>ex cequo et bono, </em>it should not be paid. This, resulting from the nature of the instrument, being non-negotiable and under seal, a party about to purchase such a security is bound, as a requisite to holding it discharged of existing equities between the original parties, to inquire of the obligor, if he have any defence or set-off to it; receiving a negative answer to the inquiry, he will be protected against anything of the kind. I know of no exception to the rule of the right of the obligor, to defalcate or set up equities as against an assignee, unless he has inquired of the obligor and ascertained that there is nothing to be set up. The party pretermitting this caution could, notwithstanding this, undoubtedly, resist a fraudulent or covinous defence; for being fraudulent, it would be no defence whatever. The point put, however, prayed the application of the principle to what they <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>claimed to be a fraud in law. That the mere existence of notes and obligations, held by the obligor against the obligee, of simultaneous date, of nearly an equal amount with the bond, were <em>per se </em>fraudulent. This instruction the court refused to give, and we think rightly so. A party may take the risk of defences to be set up, and assuredly, if he meet them with proof that they were contrived to defraud and impose upon him, or any assignee who might purchase, he would defeat the attempt. But the arrangements between'the parties for satisfaction of the security, whatever it may be, if not intended as a means to defraud others, would be as effectual against an assignee, who has not guarded himself against it by inquiry, as between the original parties.</p>
    <p id="b316-6" data-blocks='[["BL_316.6",316,[274,934,1157,1199]]]'>The second specification of error is, the refusal of the learned judge of the court below, to charge as requested in the plaintiff’s second point. Whatever might have been the effect of the paper dated the 13th of February 1854, if genuiue, under clear proof of knowledge by the agent of plaintiff, that it existed before he purchased the security, and that the investment was made upon the faith of it, regarded as an estoppel, that proof was wanting in the case. The agent testified that William C. Friend, the attorney for Patricks &amp; Friend, told him that they “ had a letter from Hazlett, acknowledging that the judgment was right. This was before the transfer to my mother.” This was insufficient, even if the paper had been such as to operate by way of estoppel. It showed neither inducement by, nor reliance upon it. The rule announced in Dezell <em>v. </em>Odell, <a href="/scl/21/0215-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Hill 215" data-case-ids="2510667" data-case-paths="/scl/21/0215-01">3 <em>Hill </em>215</a>, is a very clear embodiment of the doctrine of the books on this point; that to estop a party it must appear, <em>“ </em>1. That he has made an admission which is clearly inconsistent with the evidence he proposes to give: 2. That the othér party has acted upon the admission: 3. That the latter will be injured by allowing the truth of the admission to be disproved.” And this is the spirit of the decision in Weaver <em>v. </em>Lynch, 1 <em>Casey </em>449. To have the effect of an estoppel <em>in pais, </em>all these elements are essential. One of them, at least, as already noticed, was absent in this case, even, if otherwise, it was to operate as an estoppel — and hence we perceive no error in the answer of the court to this point. But as the paper itself was, in fact, <em>res inter alios acta, </em>if genuine, we think it would not so operate as between the parties to this suit; and that the learned judge of the court below was right in so ruling.</p>
    <p id="b316-7" data-blocks='[["BL_316.7",316,[273,2133,1157,298]],["BL_317.1",317,[207,403,1160,166]]]'>The fourth and fifth specifications of error will be considered together. A refusal, simply, to charge as requested in the plaintiff’ s fourth point, would not have been error, but the instruction accompanying the refusal, and adopted as an answer to the sixth point, was error, we think, in both. Transposing it for greater perspicuity, the charge was, that “ there is no evidence tending to rebut or impair this presumption,” <em>“ </em>that they,” the papers signed <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>
      <em>by </em>Eldred, bearing even date with the bond of Hazlett, to him, “were executed on the day they bear date,” “ arising out of the appearance of the papers themselves, or any other facts in the case.”</p>
    <p id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[207,576,1159,387]]]'>The letter of the 13th of February 1854, if genuine, taken as an admission, was evidence against the defence set up, that at the date of the bond the defendant’s intestate owed the obligor nothing. If not impeached, it was powerful evidence. It was an admission against his interest, which certainly is not very usual, unless true. Its genuineness should have been submitted to the jury, with the instruction, that if a true paper, and voluntarily given, it was evidence tending to rebut the existence of papers bearing date anterior to it, showing a contrary state of facts.</p>
    <p id="b317-7" data-blocks='[["BL_317.7",317,[203,961,1163,818]]]'>In addition to this, the form, conditions, and stipulations in the bond itself, were proper to be considered on this branch of the case. True it is, that every bond is evidence against alleged equities and defalcations at its date — but the form may, in some cases, more distinctly evince this, than in others; and in this case, is this not so ? It contains a power of attorney to enter up judgment, a waiver of inquisition and the exemption laws in case of execution, and also a provision for the payment of interest. These were indications against the existence of the obligations relied on by the defendant, which should have been considered in deciding between the antagonistic positions of the parties in regard to the counter-indebtedness of Eldred to Hazlett. It certainly was evidence in the case on that point. It might be such as to give the preponderance to other evidence, if thought not to be sufficient of itself. But the learned judge charged, that there was no evidence on this point. If the papers were antedated, they should have been held inoperative as to the assignee, unless they represented a <em>bond fide </em>indebtedness, which was ascertained and fixed before the assignment by Eldred.</p>
