They were carried safely to the point agreed upon. The railroad, at the latter place, consisted of two tracks. The accommodation train running west, on which the plaintiff was a passenger, ran upon the north track, leaving the south track for the freight trains coming east. The schedule, if the jury believe the evidence, required the accommodation train to be at Brinton’s, at ten minutes past eight o’clock, and also that the freight train should be there at the same time. To accommodate passengers getting <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>off at Brinton’s, there was a platform on the north side, for those passengers leaving the train going west, <em>and </em>also a platform on the south side of the south track, for those getting off the trains coming east. The accommodation train arrived there at the schedule time — and here there is some discrepancy in the evidence <em>; some of the </em>witnesses say the plaintiffs were inside of the cars till they stopped, and that the train was standing when they left; others say they were on the platform of the front car at the time the train arrived, and had been there for some time before the train came to the station; and some witnesses prove that plaintiffs got off before the train stopped. Was there any carelessness, at this point of time, in the accommodation train ? If 'seems to the court there is no evidence of that. Were the necessary platform and accommodations provided there for the safety of passengers ? If so, then the company had done all that could be required of them, so far as the passenger train was concerned. What then was it the duty of the plaintiffs to do ? Could they, with safety, leave the train before it stopped ? At what time, did they leave the train ? This is a question purely for the jury. If they got off before it stopped, it cannot be doubted but their safety was endangered, and that they were rash and careless. If they did so get off, did that contribute to the accident ? If so, and that act was careless and rash, they cannot recover. It was their duty to wait till the train stopped — and their disregard of that, was an act of carelessness. If, however, the jury believe they did not leave the train before stoppage, then, of course, in this, there was no negligence or carelessness.</p>

Had they an equal right to get off either on the one side or the other ? or was it their duty, in view of all the circumstances, to get off on the platform ? This is a question for the jury. If it was their duty to get off on the station platform, and they neglected or disregarded that duty, but got off on the side next to the other track, which was, no doubt, the cause of the injury — then certainly their own careless act was the cause of the injury, and they cannot recover. If, however, the jury believe they had a right to get off on that side, and they violated no duty in doing so, then no carelessness could be attributed to them.</p>

In what is it alleged that the defendants were negligent ? If the evidence is believed, the accommodation train was in no fault. What, then, caused the injury ? It was not that train, but another freight train coming east. Was there negligence in the agents of the company on that train ? If so, in what did it consist ? It was running on schedule time, at a slow rate, was whistling, and ringing the bell, as it approached. There is no sufficient evidence to justify a conclusion of negligence <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>in that train. In what, then, did the negligence consist ? It is alleged that the trains ought not to meet at a station; and that the very fact of their meeting there is carelessness. We do not think so, for the reasons stated in our answer to the first point of plaintiff. It seems to the court that the evidence to charge the defendants with negligence, in this case, is very slight; still, the facts connected with the stoppage of the train, being contradictory, and the conclusion of negligence, under all the circumstances, being one of fact, is left to the jury.</p>

In fact, the importance of the rule cannot be over-estimated, when we regard our short and simple pleading, which rarely brings the law of the case on the record. The only method, in most cases, a party has left to bring before the court, and from thence to this court for review, a proposition of law, is by presenting it as a point to be charged upon, and when clearly responded to, it greatly aids the jury in coming to conclusions in the case; or, if distinctly negatived, the party has no trouble in having it reviewed. It is, therefore, necessary that the point, if relevant, be substantially answered, otherwise it will be error. The qualification of the rule to relevancy excludes, of course, abstract propositions, or such as, if answered as prayed for, would not have benefited the party.</p>

If they did voluntarily and negligently place themselves there, when there was a safe place of exit, <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>and full opportunity to make it, surely the defendants would not be liable as common carriers, if, instead of leaving by the usual mode of stepping on the platform, they negligently and voluntarily placed themselves on the other track. This was the law of the plaintiffs’ point. It is true, it was faulty in the assumption of the facts of which it was predicated. But as to this no objection was made by the court, and a distinct answer was not refused for this reason, nor could it well have been for such a reason, as it was capable of as distinct an answer on the law, giving at the same time the facts to the jury, as if it had been hypothetical in form. It should have been as distinctly answered, if answered at all, as if put hypothetically. But it was not, and we do not find it sufficiently affirmed, in relation to the facts on which it was based, in any part of the charge. True, it might be deduced from observations in other connections, and relations to other facts. But this is not quite enough. It ought to have been answered in the relation in which it was put, somewhere. The party was entitled to this. The jury could not, without much greater skill in construing language than generally falls to their lot, have told whether the point was affirmed or negatived.</p>
    <p id="b324-5" data-blocks='[["BL_324.6",324,[278,1271,1169,1153]]]'>The point asserted immunity to the company, if the plaintiff and his son voluntarily placed themselves on the other track of the road, unless in case of gross negligence on part of the company. The answer, instead of affirming this, if the facts were true, treated of the duty of the company to convey safely, and to provide a safe mode of exit from the cars, and added, “ if they left the train in the usual way and were properly regardful of their own safety, and did everything their own duty required of them, and in thus leaving the train, and before they found a place of safety, they were injured by the negligence of the company, then we think that passengers in that condition, although separated from the train, would have a right to recover for such negligence. This is not the case of a stranger unconnected with the train, placing himself voluntarily on the track.” This was clearly an insufficient answer; in fact, in addition to the just complaint of insufficiency, it introduced an element which it is difficult to tell the effect of in such a case, and that was in leaving it to be inferred that there was no place of safety provided for leaving the cars, for the court say, if “ they did everything that duty required of them in thus leaving the train, and before they found a <em>place of safety,” </em>they were injured by the negligence of the company, a recovery might be had. From this language, a jury might have inferred, and perhaps did, that acting as carefully as they could, there was no place of safety provided for leaving the cars. An intimation like this, although not intended, might have a very mischievous effect. This assignment of error, we think, is sustained.</p>

      <em>2. </em>The second assignment, like the first, is to the insufficiency of the answer to defendant’s second point. This point asserted the principle that if the accident occurred after the plaintiff and deceased had left the cars, the liability of common carriers was ended, and having been killed after this, the action could not be sustained, unless the death was the result of gross negligence or wanton injury. There was sufficient testimony in the case to justify the defendant in making the point, and the court should have given a distinct response to it, although, like the last one, it was faulty in form. Notwithstanding this, the court essayed an answer by saying, <em>“ </em>this point is answered in our answer to the first point of the defendant as above.” How answered, affirmatively or negatively ? <em>We </em>cannot say, and we think a jury could not have derived much instruction from it. As we have already said, the party was entitled, either directly in answer to this point, or in the body of the charge, to a distinct response to the proposition. The gravamen of the complaint was against the defendants as common carriers, and as such they were counted against. If this relation had ended when the accident occurred, the plaintiffs could not have recovered, and the evidence shows this to have been a debatable point in the case. A very different rule of responsibility exists, where such an accident occurs during the continuance of the relation of common carriers, and after it has entirely ended. And it was important that the jury should have been instructed clearly as to this, so that they might not disregard the distinction, upon the idea that the company were answerable at all events, under the evidence, and that the objection was merely technical. Special care is the duty of the court in all cases, where there is much to excite sympathy, and lead away the judgment from the application of well settled principles of law. Adherence to these principles under all circumstances, is the only security we can have.

There must be no negligence on their part. There is also on part of the passenger an implied contract, that he will and does “ assent to all the company’s reasonable rules and regulations for entering, occupying, and <em>leaving their cars, </em>and if injury befall him by reason of his disregard of regulations which are necessary to the conducting of the business, the company are not liable in damages, even though the negligence of their servants concurred with his own negligence in causing the mischief:” Sullivan <em>v. </em>The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, 6 <em>Casey </em>234, <em>per </em>Woodward, J. Here are reciprocal duties defined, resting upon principles most reasonable, and of the clearest justice, and nothing but special circumstances, or the most pressing exigencies, which are not now foreseen, could justify a departure from them. Nothing of the kind marked the case in hand. But the court submitted the question to the jury, whether the parties in this case had not a right to leave the cars, either by the safe means provided by the company, or by a way not provided. The abstract question of their right to do so, is one thing, and need not be disputed; but the liability of the company by reason of their doing so is quite another thing. The regulation of the company for leaving the cars by the platform, was apparent from its existence, and having been placed there and used for the purpose. This was the usual egress from the train. Without proof of any necessity, coupled with the proposition of their right to leave the cars at either side, the jury were, by the instruction of the court, allowed to find on the opposite of the principle laid down in the case of Sullivan <em>v. </em>The Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company, <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>which declares that passengers are bound to conform to the regulations of the company on “ entering, occupying, and leaving the cars.” The duty being fixed by the relation of the parties to each other, the contract must be performed by both. A departure by either could be justified only by a paramount necessity. The question then for the jury should have been, first, as to the performance of the duty by the company in providing safe cars and safe means of egress from them; and, secondly, if this were so, was it the fault of the company that the injury occurred ? and to establish this, more was necessary to be proven than that the plaintiff and the injured son voluntarily chose to depart from the cars by an unusual way. There should have been proof of some existing necessity for their doing so, to excuse them from- negligence, and the consequences of it. Then, the question might have been left to the jury, as to the propriety of their violating the regulations of the company. A voluntary disregard of regulations providing for their safe exit by the platform, was a disregard of their obligations to the company; and if this were so, the plaintiffs ought not to recover. We hold, on these principles, that the company’s liability could not be fixed for the injury consequent on a choice of the passenger, in disregard of the provisions made by them for his safety and convenience. It was, we think, error in the court to submit the question of the rights of the parties to leave the cars at either side, in the absence of the proof of a justifying necessity in doing so. It was not negligence on part of the company that they did not by force or barriers prevent the parties from leaving at the wrong side. People are not to be treated like cattle; they are presumed to act reasonably in all given contingencies, and the company have no reason to expect anything else in this case. There was error in this portion of the charge.</p>

The court instructed the jury on this subject by saying, “ If the jury find' for the plaintiff, the question is one for the jury entirely.” There was no prayer for instructions. Yet this will not prevent a party dissatisfied with the charge, from having it reviewed, and errors • corrected, if they exist, in the charge as given. It is obvious, that this general and unrestricted reference of the question of damages to the jury, gave them the fullest latitude of construction in assessing them. It left them to base that assessment upon such standard as each juror might set up for himself, or any common one that might happen to suit the feelings, tastes, or judgment of all, in the particular case, never again, perhaps, to be the rule in any future case, however similar in circumstances. Rights should be better defined. And although, from the inherent difficulty in estimating the value of life, when called upon to compensate for its loss, we cannot lay down what may properly be called rules, to guide in making the estimate, yet it is <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>our duty to announce such principles of compensation as we think the legislature intended by the act in question, that there may be some approximation to uniformity of results in such cases.</p>

These acts confer new rights unknown to the common law. It existed in the civil law, and was an institution of the old Saxon code; so too, is it to by found in the Scottish law, under the head of “ Assythements for Homicide.” But as the compensation under all these laws rested upon very precise regulations, generally, peculiarly applicable to the times, circumstances, estates, and conditions of the deceased and the parties entitled, we derive no light from them.</p>

The damages, it has been held, are for the <em>death </em>of the party, as it is with us. Under this statute, providing for compensation for the same thing as does ours, namely, the death of the decedent, we have one case which turns on the subject of the rule of damages. It is the case of Blake <em>v. </em>Midland Railway Company, 10 <em>Eng. L. </em>&amp; <em>Eq. R. </em>437. The case had been tried before Baron Parke, at Derbyshire Assizes, and came before the Queen’s Bench in banc, on a rule to show' cause why a new trial should not be granted, on the ground of misdirection in regard to the principle upon which damages should have been assessed. In granting the new trial, the doctrine is held that the jury, in estimating damages under that statute, “ are to be confined to injuries, of which a pecuniary estimate can he made, and cannot take into consideration the mental suffering occasioned to the survivors by the death,” and that nothing may be allowed as <em>solatium, </em>that being incapable of a pecuniary estimate, nor for the sufferings of the injured party. <a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a>

And hence the conclusion, that the provision giving damages for the death, was only such as could be tested by a pecuniary estimate not speculative or fanciful. “ The measure of damage,” said the learned judge, “ is not the loss or suffering of the deceased, but the injury resulting from his death to his family.” Our statute, although differing, in the absence of details, from the British statute, is a provision for compensating precisely the same sort of injury, the damage occasioned to the survivor by the death of the decedent, and hence we may avail ourselves of the light shed upon the subject by the learned court in the case cited.</p>

    <p id="b329-7" data-blocks='[["BL_329.7",329,[202,1345,1160,1073]],["BL_330.1",330,[279,406,1161,641]]]'>The case of The Pennsylvania Railroad Company <em>v. </em>McCloskey’s Administrator, 11 <em>Harris </em>526, while it adheres to the rule of giving damages only upon such bases as are susceptible of a pecuniary estimate, seems to regard the value of the life lost as the basis of the estimate, rather than the injury resulting from it to the survivor entitled to sue. This conclusion flowed from the form of, and parties to, the action, and naturally led to the result. It was a suit by the personal representatives, for the benefit of the estate. Treated in this light, and as the plaintiffs, the administrators, were not damaged by the death, but were recovering for the estate, the only estimate, it seems to me, that could be made was of the value of the life. The wrong done to it survived by virtue of the statute to the estate, and gave the personal representatives their right of recovery co-extensively with its value. But for some reason — a wise one, of course — this law was in 1855 altered, and the right to sue was conferred on parents for the loss of children, and children for parents, and reciprocally between husband and wife. This was a new and independent right given by positive law — not cast upon them by survivorship as for an injury to the decedent. It is for the wrong done to them. In this view of the law, we think the rule which should have been observed in this case differs from that in The Pennsylvania Railroad Company <em>v. </em>McCloskey’s Administrator, and more resembles the case of a father suing for injury to his child. In the case of The Pennsylvania Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Kelly, 7 <em>Casey </em>372, the rule of damages in such a case was <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>considered, and in delivering the opinion of the court, Mr. Justice Woodward says, “the damages must be compensatory merely, and that compensation must have regard to the plaintiff’s loss of his services, and to the expense of nursing and medical treatment.” “ The father was entitled to the services of his child during minority, and by just so much as this injury impaired the value of this right was he entitled to compensatory damages,” and it was added, “ that it was proper for the jury to understand that the suffering endured by the boy, and the disfiguration of his form, and whatever was merely personal to him, should not enter into the father’s damages, because for them the son would have a right of action.” This is a rule of damage on a very kindred subject, and is scarcely distinguishable from cases like the present, except in extent of injury, and is, in essence, the principle of the cases already cited.</p>

This is the only pecuniary damage done to them, and this the law allows them to recover, if entitled on the facts to recover at alí. This excludes damages for the suffering of the deceased, which was personal to himself, and did not survive, as well as for solace, which are incapable of appreciation, so as to be compensated. No money could be the measure of the affliction. No road, great or small, but would fall beneath the weight of such a rule, if applied; and for an injury happening by a mere oversight, amounting, of course, to negligence, by some agent in the transit of the cars, it would be a severe penalty to visit the company with extravagant and exterminating damages. But they should be held to a strict accountability to the extent that a fair interpretation of the statute will allow. In making the estimate of the value of the life and consequent damage by the death, much is still left to the sound discretion of the jury. Whatever is susceptible of a pecuniary estimate is included within it, and what we have seen was not to be included, must be excluded.</p>
