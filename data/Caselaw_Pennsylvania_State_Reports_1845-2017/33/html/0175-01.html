It appears from undisputed testimony, that prior to 1813, a man by the name of Buck, erected a mill and built a dam from the main land to Buck’s Island, as it was called; which mill and dam have been kept by said Buck and those claiming under him to the time of bringing this suit. That the defendants are a corporation created by statute of the state of New York, and coming into this state by virtue of an Act of Assembly of this state, passed in 1841, by which act they were authorized to make and construct a portion of their road within the county of Susquehanna, in the manner mentioned in said Act of Assembly. It is alleged, that in the making, construction, and keeping in repair of this road by the defendants, the injury complained of was committed. The evidence in relation to this injury, has occupied much time, and in calling it to your minds somewhat in detail (as is here done), you will judge how far any damage has resulted to plaintiff, consequential upon acts done by defendants, as alleged by him. The witnesses differ considerably in their statements of existing facts, and it is for you to determine, from the whole evidence, whether any damage has been sustained by the plaintiff. An important question here arises, upon matters of law connected with the case. We are all bound by the laws as construed by our courts of the dernier ressort; and whatever our feelings and sympathies may be in a case, they must be controlled by the decisions of the Supreme Court.

If they have gone beyond the rights granted them by the act in question, then they are liable. To illustrate — If it had become necessary in making the road to interrupt and turn the course of some small stream of water, which supplied a large tannery, by which said tannery was rendered of no value, yet no damage could be recovered of the company, for the act authorizing the making of the road protects them from such unavoidable consequences.

Thus, if the jury believe that damage has been sustained by the plaintiff, by reason of the embankments having been extended into the river, or the natural channel been obstructed by the acts of the defendants, so as to diminish the supply of water for the mill by changing the current of water running to the mill, or otherwise, and that the defendants might, by incurring reasonable expense, have made and constructed the road further back, or have deposited the dirt in constructing the road, or in removing the same from the slides, in some other place, so as to have avoided causing the obstructions and injury to the plaintiff complained of, then the plaintiff would be entitled to recover; otherwise, he would not be so entitled; and in reference to reasonable expenses so to be incurred, we would say, that it could not be expected that defendants would have to call into requisition an immense amount of wealth to have changed the location of the track, or to avoid making the obstructions (if any), but it means exactly a reasonable and rational expenditure to surmount the obstacles presented. The jury have heard the testimony of several witnesses upon this point, and their statements as to the effects and expense of cutting further back into the hill, and the situation of the travelled road not far up the hill, and the rise of ground beyond that, as <em>detailed, </em>in the evidence, and will decide on this point as they think the evidence may warrant.</p>

A deed, or rather the record of a deed, has been given in evidence, of a sale of this mill property, made by the plaintiff, about the date of bringing this suit, for the sum as expressed in the deed of $20,000; and this was urged as going to show he has sustained no loss, it being for a far greater sum than some of the witnesses estimated the value of the property. This may be some evidence, or have some bearing to that effect, but very small or faint on that point. The consideration named in the deed very frequently is but a small index of the actual sale, or the real value for which the property sold.

The true question is, whether the defendants had made themselves liable, in view of the instructions here given you, and from the evidence in the case; and if so, then the injury actually sustained by the plaintiff to the bringing this suit, should be the measure of your verdict; and if not, then should it be for defendants.”</p>

J., says, “in this respect, a grant by a public agent of limited powers, and bound not to throw away the interests confided to it, is different from a grant by an individual who is master of the subject. To revoke the latter, after an expenditure in the prosecution of it, would be a fraud; but he who accepts a license from the legislature, knowing that he is dealing with an agent bound by duty not to impair a public right, does so at his risk, and a voluntary expenditure on the foot of it gives him no claim for compensation.” To the same point is the Monongahela Navigation Company <em>v. </em>Coons, <em>supra. </em>The grant to the Company, if it conflicted in any way with the license under which the plaintiff claimed, and impaired it for the public benefit, was but a realization of the contingency upon which it had been granted. That it was for the public benefit we are bound to presume — neither want of wisdom, care, or consideration can be judicially imputed to the law-making or sovereign power of the Commonwealth. The plaintiff, therefore, and even under a much larger responsibility than the Act of Assembly imposed, as against a grant which we must presume was based upon the paramount interests of the public, was not entitled to be compensated for the alleged injury to his mill privilege; and such was the decision in The Susque<a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>hanna Canal Company <em>v. </em>Wright, in which damages for injury to him were required to be paid, but were not; injury to such a privilege not being held to be within the agreement of compensation. Such also is the principle of the case of The Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad Company, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Whart.%2045" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="6 Whart. 45">6 <em>Whart. </em>45</a>; Troy and Boston Railway <em>v. </em>Northern Turnpike, <a href="/barb/11/0100-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="11 Barb. 100" data-case-ids="4909670" data-case-paths="/barb/11/0100-01">11 <em>Barb. </em>100</a>; Henry <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh and Allegheny Bridge Company, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 85" data-case-ids="483385" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0085-01">8 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>85</a>.</p>
    <p id="b182-6" data-blocks='[["BL_182.6",182,[299,728,1152,217]]]'>These several matters of law and fact are sufficient, we think, to show that the plaintiff had not the right to recover; because the company were not required to pay consequential damages, and because the plaintiff had no title to compensation arising out of the alleged interference with the river to the prejudice of his mills.</p>
    <p id="b182-7" data-blocks='[["BL_182.7",182,[298,943,1155,896]]]'>The learned judge of the Common Pleas, however, thought differently, and left the question of the plaintiff’s right to recover to depend upon the question whether the company by a reasonable expenditure of money might not “ have so changed the site” of their road, “ as to avoid having caused such damage.” It is difficult to imagine a case, in the absence of some legislation directing it, th.at could require such a duty to be performed by a jury. The duty to be executed involved the question of location, not only at the point in question, but in the effect such a change would have on the grade of the road — and would also require the highest exercise of scientific skill and investigation. Nor would this be all. A reasonable expenditure of money is but a comparative matter, depending on many things — amongst them, ability of the company and the value of the enterprise; and this door once opened, the issue would be in fact made to depend on matters beyond and outside of the case, involving questions of fact noway connected with the issue trying. The company alone were intrusted with the right of location; their interest being the surest guaranty that the best and cheapest location, and that doing the least damage, would be selected. In this, their right cannot be questioned, in a controversy in regard to damages.</p>
    <p id="b182-8" data-blocks='[["BL_182.8",182,[298,1837,1151,430]]]'>We think this portion of the charge was the radical error in the case, for it included in it, an affirmance of the doctrine, that the defendant was liable for consequential damages to the plaintiff, resulting from the • construction and maintenance of their road; and that the plaintiff had a right to claim damages of the grantees of the state for infringing or interfering with his privilege, in constructing their road; as well as the inherent error in the matter last noticed, in regard to the reasonable expenditure by the company to avoid injury. We have shown that both these positions are wrong.</p>
