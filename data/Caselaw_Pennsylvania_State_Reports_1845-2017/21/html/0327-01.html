On the 10th of Nov. 1847, and subsequently, a number of judgments <em>were entered of record </em>against William Williams, the largest of which was a cautionary judgment in favor of the Exchange Bank of Pittsburgh for $30,000. On this judgment a <em>fi.fa. </em>was issued to No. 8 of Dee. Term, 1849, under which the sheriff levied on all the real estate of William Williams, including such interest as he had in lot No. 14. After an amicable condemnation, and by consent, the property was sold in lots to different persons, for the entire sum of $28,000; lot No. 14 having been struck down at $2500 to Wm. M. Lloyd; who purchased with record and actual notice of the conveyance to Sarah Williams, on the 9th Nov. 1847. This ejectment was brought by William M. Lloyd against Wm. Williams; but by agreement of the parties filed, Sarah Williams was made the real defendant. It was stated that the authority to confess the judgment in favor of the bank was executed on the 9th Nov. 1847, the date of the conveyance to Sarah Williams.</p>

The property was then sold for $2000. In 1836 William Williams having failed to invest the money, gave to his mother his note for $1800. This' note was shown to be in his handwriting of that date, and to have been in the possession of Mrs. Williams for many years previous to 1847.

That it was done in contemplation of that act did not admit of a doubt. That, under these and other facts attending the transaction, he was asked to instruct the jury that the conveyance was fraudulent, and, so far as it interfered with the rights of creditors, -was void. He declined to do so, saying that there were facts in controversy, and he referred to the jury to decide, whether a good consideration for the conveyance had been shown, stating to the jury that if the sale or conveyance had been shown to have been made in discharge of an honest debt, a good consideration had been shown. 2dly. Were the circumstances of William Williams, as disclosed in the evidence, known to Sarah Williams at the time she took the conveyance, and was the conveyance taken at that particular time in view of her son’s large indebtedness, and to secure to herself the property before it could be reached by the Exchange Bank, or his other creditors ? If so, they were instructed to regard the conveyance as fraudulent' and void, and not standing in the way of the plaintiff’s recovery, although they should find it to have been <em>upon good consideration. </em>He added, There can be no doubt that William Williams made the conveyance in view of his indebtedness, and intended confession of judgment to the bank. “ The question is, <em>was she influenced by the same facts </em>?”</p>

Yet it is not denied that she had a just debt against her son, which he was bound in all good conscience to pay. He chose to pay it by a conveyance of the property in dispute, and she agreed to accept it in satisfaction. There was no inadequacy or taint of dishonesty about the consideration. But the bank had a claim against Williams at the same time, and the defendant’s conduct in getting a conveyance before the bank could or would obtain a lien, seems to be thought such inexcusable wickedness that nothing can save her but full proof that she was ignorant of the bank’s claim. The court below conceded this. The jury were told that they might find for the plaintiff, if they believed the defendant (though her debt was just) knew her son’s circumstances, and took the deed to secure the property to herself before it could be reached by his other creditors. This was far beyond anything the plaintiff had a right' to look for. Suppose she did know that he was failing ? What rule of duty required her to wait until his other debts were satisfied before she made an effort to secure her own ? She was no more bound to take care of the bank’s interests, than the bank was to see that hers did not suffer. If it could be held that a conveyance of a debtor to his creditor is fraudulent, because he knows that there are other creditors besides himself, the maxim which gives the advantage to the vigilant would be reversed; for those who would <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>sleep soundest and longest would get the most. Two creditors equally honest are equally favored in equity, and when they <em>come </em>into a court of law their rights are determined according to priority. Either may secure his debt by taking a judgment or a conveyance from the debtor, though he does know that the other’s chances of security will thereby be diminished. The doctrine laid down in this case by the court below was countenanced by the act of 1849, and the construction given to it in Summer’s Appeal. But several unreported cases, not known at the time of this trial, have exploded it utterly.</p>
    <p id="b331-6" data-blocks='[["BL_331.4",331,[213,850,1162,259]]]'>The relationship between the plaintiff and the grantor in the deed was a fact which held her to stricter proof of her debt and of her honesty in the whole transaction, than would have been required of a stranger. But she met this suspicious circumstance with evidence so clear that it silenced every doubt; and this made her case like that of any other honest creditor.</p>
