    <p class="summary" id="b225-8" data-blocks='[["BL_225.7",225,[192,969,1165,688]]]'>John E. Shroder purchased a house and lot on the east side of North Queen street near Centre square, in the city of Lancaster, from George B. Withers, executor of George Withers, deceased, containing thirty feet in front, sixty feet deep. Deed dated 1st day of April, 1851. On the east side of said lot, John Metzgar owned a .lot with a brick warehouse thereon, fourteen feet and three inches adjoining Shroder’s lot on the north-east, and fifteen feet and three inches <em>along an alley, </em>which said Metzgar conveyed to said Shroder by deed, dated 15th day of March, 1852. The lower part of the eastern side of the first above-mentioned lot of Shroder is bounded by <em>an alley, </em>which turns to the east between the property purchased from Metzgar and A. N. Breneman. Shroder tore down or converted said warehouse into a kitchen, &amp;c., on the first above-mentioned lot. Breneman alleged that in doing so he encroached on said alley by erecting a small balcony, and therefore he brought this action of trespass.</p>

Here the alleged injury is the erection‘of a balcony projecting over the ground which the plaintiff avers he is owner of, and attached to a building belonging to the defendant; it is elevated to a considerable height from the ground. This, however, would be a trespass if the plaintiff be the owner of the soil below, for a title to land gives to the owner all that is upon or above it. Neither would a mere non-user of the premises, by the plaintiff or those under whom he claims, destroy his right or title to the freehold, unless the premises, or that part upon which the alleged trespass is committed, was given up by the plaintiff, or those under whom he claims, for twenty-one years or more, and adverse possession for that period taken by some one else, who held the same in opposition to the owner. Such adverse possession may be shown <a id="p226" href="#p226" data-label="226" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*226</a>by any one occupying the same, using or putting a building upon it, or doing some such act as would go to show that he claimed it as his own; and when adverse possession is thus held for twenty-one years, the owner is divested of all right to the soil, and it would require the same length of time of adverse possession on his 'part to regain the ownership.</p>

It is true that one of the witnesses testifies that he knew the premises in dispute forty-five years ago; that in 1807 there was a privy upon it; that it was an old building at that time, and Judge Schaeffer testifies that he knew it for many years, and that it was removed in 1824; that afterwards it was used for a dung heap by Dr. Kerfoot, who rented a stable or building to which the privy was attached; and other witnesses prove that it was used as a place for the deposit of filth until about six or seven years ago, when Howett’s warehouse was built. According to the testimony it appears the privy stood for about seventeen years ; and afterwards it was used as a dung heap and deposit for filth. It is true Dr. Kerfoot made use of it as a dung heap, and that he was the tenant of the stable to which the privy was attached while it <em>existed; </em>but he was also, at the same time, the tenant of the premises now owned by the plaintiff, and I cannot discover that his using the dung heap was inconsistent with the right of the plaintiff.*</p>

It was contended that a case was made out of adverse possession by the privy and manure pit, from 1807 till 1846, when the stable and its appurtenant pit were displaced by Howett for his warehouse.</p>

This privy was appurtenant to the Miller property, belonged to it, and thus held under that right by Kerfoot, (as a tenant, not allowed to dispute his landlord’s title) as a stable for his horses, &amp;c.; and this possession, adverse, open, notorious, and positive, was not affected because Kerfoot resided with his family at the same time in the property now owned by plaintiff.</p>

If they ever claimed title to the ground, which was denied, it was a title gained by possession, which their long silence and neglect to exercise any right over it, shows was abandoned, or lost in the same way it was acquired. But if the ground was kept as a depository for manure, it was not by the Miller family. If Kerfoot kept his manure there, he was plaintiff’s tenant, and had a right to keep his manure where he pleased. The mere fact of Kerfoot doing so, is not the exercise of a right so inconsistent with the plaintiff’s title that the same ean be used against him.</p>

It was found, upon evidence quite sufficient, that the soil belonged to the plaintiff, though it was subject !to a right of Way, and was used as a private alley. The only point of the case which is strong enough to bear an argument is, that the statute of limitations had extinguished the plaintiff’s title. There was a privy on the ground in dispute, but it is not proved to have been there for twenty-on'e.years. To eke out the case, it was shown that after the privy was removed, the spot it had occupied was used for a dungheap. This will not do. The mere throwing of manure on another's land is not-such an adverse possession as will give any ■right under the statute to him who does <em>it; </em>-much less will it enable a third person to 'say, that the original owner’s title is gone, ■and appropriate it to himself for that reason.</p>
