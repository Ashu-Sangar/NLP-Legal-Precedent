    <p id="b158-6" data-blocks='[["BL_158.6",158,[298,464,1167,596]]]'>On the 6th of March, 1852, an act was passed by the legislature, authorizing the corporate authorities of Philadelphia city to subscribe for shares in the stock of the Philadelphia, Easton, and Water-Gap Railroad Company, and to raise the'money necessary to pay for such stock by a loan on the credit of the city. On the 9th of May, 1852, a similar act was passed for a similar subscription to the stock of the Hempfield Railroad Company. In pursuance of these acts, the Select and Common Councils required the Mayor, as the executive magistrate of the city, to subscribe for ten thousand shares in the Hempfield Company forthwith, and for the same number in the Water-Gap Company, upon certain conditions. The Mayor has made one subscription accordingly, and intends to make the other as soon as the condition of the ordinance is complied with.</p>

They complain that these subscriptions.' will add another million of dollars to the already heavy debt of the city, impair the public credit thereof, and greatly augment the taxes of the people. The object of the bill is to restrain the Mayor from carrying the ordinances into effect. The whole subject has been argued on the motion for a special injunction. Our decision now will terminate the controversy, and have all the effect of a final decree.</p>

It is not pretended that anything has been done, or is likely to be done by the authorities of the city, except what the legislature meant to authorize. But the plaintiffs assert that the laws are unconstitutional and void. Whether the legislature can pass a valid act giving to a municipal corporation the power of subscribing to the stock of a railroad company, is the sole question before us.</p>

The fate of many most important public improvements hangs on our decision. If all municipal subscriptions are void, railroads, which are necessary to give the state those advantages to which everything else entitles her, must stand unfinished for years to come, and large sums, already expended on them, must be lost. Hot less than fourteen millions of these stocks have been taken by boroughs, counties, and cities within this Commonwealth. They have uniformly been paid for, either with bonds handed over directly to the railroad companies, or else with the proceeds of similar bonds sold to individuals who have advanced the money. It may well be supposed that a large amount of them are in the hands of innocent holders, who have paid for them in good faith. We <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>cannot award the injunction asked for, without declaring that all such bonds are as destitute of legal validity as so much blank parchment. Besides the deadly blow it would give to our improvements, and the disastrous effect of it on the private fortunes of many honest men, at home and abroad, it would seriously wound the credit and character of the state, and do much to lessen the influence of our institutions on the public mind of the world.</p>
    <p id="b159-6" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[217,721,1168,1244]]]'>The reverse of this picture is not less appalling. It is even more so, as some view it. If the power exists, it will continue to be exerted, and generally it will be used under the influence of those who are personally interested, and who do not see or care for the ultimate injui'y it may bring upon the people at large. Men feel acutely what affects themselves as individuals, and are but slightly influenced by public considerations. What each person wins by his enterprise, is. all his own; the public losses are shared by thousands. The selfish passion is intensified by the prospect of immediate gain; private speculation becomes ardent, energetic, and daring, while public spirit — cold and timid at the best — grows feebler still when the danger is remote. Under these circumstances it is easy to see where this ultra-enterprising spirit will end. It carried the state to the verge of financial ruin; it has produced revulsions of trade and currency in every commercial country; it is tending now, and here, to the bankruptcy of cities and counties. In England, no investments have been more disastrous than railway stocks, unless those of the South Sea bubble be an exception. In this country they have not generally been profitable. The dividends of the largest works in the neighboring states, north and south of us, have disappointed the stockholders. Not one of the completed railroads in this state has uniformly paid interest on its cost. If only a few of the roads projected in Pennsylvania should be as unfortunate as all the finished ones, such a burden would be imposed on certain parts of the state, as the industry of no people has ever endured without being crushed. Still, this plan of improving the country, if unchecked by this Court, will probably go on until it results in some startling calamity, to-rouse the masses of the people.</p>

We are to deal with this strictly as a judicial question. However clear our convictions may be, that the system is pernicious and dangerous, we cannot put it down by usurping authority which does not belong to us. That would be to commit a greater wrong than any which we could possibly repair by it. So on the other hand, the loss to the bond-holders — the ruin of the railroad companies — the injury to the commerce, and even the stain on the character of the state, are considerations which cannot be weighed for a moment, in any scale of ours, against the constitutional rights <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>of the parties before us. We will therefore address ourselves to the serious business of ascertaining whether the laws in question do violate the constitution or not.</p>
    <p id="b160-6" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[313,542,1157,1023]]]'>It is important, first of all, to settle the rule of interpretation. This can be best done by a slight reference to the origin of our political system. . In the beginning the people held i.n their own hands all the power of an absolute government. The transcendant powers of Parliament devolved on them by the revolution (1 <em>Bald. </em>220; <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wheat.%20584" class="citation" data-index="51" data-cite="8 Wheat. 584">8 <em>Wheaton </em>584</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pet.%20656" class="citation" data-index="52" data-cite="2 Pet. 656">2 <em>Peters </em>656</a>). Antecedent to the adoption of the federal constitution, the power of the states was supreme and unlimited (3 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>68). If the people of Pennsylvania had given all the authority which they themselves possessed, to a single person, they would have created a despotism as absolute in its control over life, liberty, and property, as that of the Russian autocrat. But they delegated a portion of it to the United States, specifying what they gave, and withholding 'the rest. The powers not given to the government of the Union were bestowed on the government of the state, with certain limitations and exceptions, expressly set down in the state constitution. The federal constitution confers powers particularly enumerated; that of the state contains a general grant of all powers not excepted; The construction of the former instrument is strict against those who claim under it; the interpretation of the latter is strict against those who stand upon the exceptions, and liberal in' favor of the government itself. The federal government can do nothing but what is authorized expressly or by clear implication; the state ma.y do whatever is not prohibited.</p>
    <p id="b160-7" data-blocks='[["BL_160.5",160,[312,1566,1158,812]],["BL_161.1",161,[205,427,1166,462]]]'>The powers bestowed on the state government were distributed by the constitution to the three great departments: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. The power to make laws was granted in section 1 of Art. 1, by the following words: “ <em>The legislative power of this Commonwealth shall be vested in a Greneral </em>Assembly, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.” It is plain that the force of these general words, if there had been nothing elsewhere to qualify them, would have given to the Assembly an unlimited power to make all such laws as they might think proper. They would have had the whole omnipotence of the British parliament. But the absolute power of the people themselves had been previously limited by the federal constitution, and they could not bestow on the legislature authority which had already been given to Congress. The judicial and executive powers were also lodged elsewhere, and the legislative department was forbidden to trench upon the others by an implication as clear as words could make it. The jurisdiction of the Assembly was still further confined by that part of the constitution called the “ Declaration of Rights,” which, in twenty-five sections, carefully enume<a id="p161" href="#p161" data-label="161" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*161</a>rates the reserved rights of the people, and closes by declaring that “ everything in this Article is <em>excepted out of the general powers </em>of the government, and shall remain for ever inviolate.” The General Assembly cannot, therefore, pass any law to conflict with the rightful authority of Congress, nor perform a judicial or executive function, nor violate the popular privileges reserved by the Declaration of Rights, nor change the organic structure of the government, nor exercise any other power prohibited in the constitution. If it does any of these things, the judiciary claims, and in clear cases has always exercised, the right to declare such acts void.</p>
    <p id="b161-6" data-blocks='[["BL_161.4",161,[205,899,1169,601]]]'>But beyond this there lies a vast field of power, granted to the legislature by the general words of the constitution, and not reserved, prohibited, or given away to others. Of this field the General Assembly is entitled to the full and uncontrolled possession. Their use of it can be limited only by their own discretion. The reservation of some powers does not imply a restriction on the exercises of others which are not reserved. On the contrary, it is a universal rule of construction, founded in the clearest reason, that general words in anyinstrument or statute are strengthened by exceptions, and weakened by enumeration. To me, it is as plain that the General Assembly may exercise all powers which are properly legislative, and which are not taken away by our own, or by the federal constitution, as it is that the people have all the rights which are expressly reserved.</p>
    <p id="b161-7" data-blocks='[["BL_161.5",161,[208,1499,1165,773]]]'>We are urged, however, to go further than this, and to hold that a' law, though not prohibited, is void if it violates the spirit of our institutions, or impairs any of those rights which it is the object of a free government to protect, and to declare it unconstitutional if it be wrong and unjust. But we cannot do this. It would be assuming a right to change the constitution, to supply what we might conceive to bo its defects, to fill up every <em>casus omissus, </em>and to interpolate into it whatever in our opinion ought to have been put there by its framers. The constitution has given us a list of the things which the legislature may not do. If we extend that list, we alter the instrument, we become ourselves the aggressors, and violate both the letter and spirit of the organic law as grossly as the legislature possibly could. If we can add to the reserved rights of the people, we can take them away; if we can mend, we can mar; if we can remove the landmarks which we find established, we can obliterate them; if we can change the constitution in any particular, there is nothing but our own will to prevent us from demolishing it entirely.</p>

But this is inseparable from the nature of human institutions. The wisdom of man has never conceived of a government with power <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>sufficient to answer its legitimate ends, and at the same time incapable of mischief. Ho political system can be made so perfect that its rulers will always hold it to the true course. In the very best a great deal must be trusted to the discretion of those who administer it. In ours, the people have given larger powers to the legislature, and relied, for the faithful execution of them, on the wisdom and honesty of that department, and on the direct accountability of the members to their constituents. There is no shadow of reason for supposing that the mere abuse of power was meant to be corrected by the judiciary.</p>
    <p id="b162-6" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[319,856,1163,811]]]'>There is nothing inore easy than to imagine a thousand tyrannical things which the legislature may do, if its members forget all their duties; disregard utterly the obligations they owe to their constituents, and recklessly determine to trample upon right and justice. But to take away the power from the legislature because they may abuse it, and give to the judges the right of controlling it, would not be advancing a single step, since the judges can be <em>imagined, </em>to be as corrupt and as wicked as legislators. It has been said of the ablest judge that ever sat on this bench, and one whose purity of character was as perfect as any who has ever lived or ever will live, that his opinions on such subjects are not to be relied on. If this be so, then transferring the seat of authority from the legislature to the Courts, would be putting our interests in the hands of a set of very fallible men, instead of the respectable body which now holds it. What is worse still, the judges are almost entirely irresponsible, and heretofore they have been altogether so, while the members of the legislature, who would do the imaginary things referred to, “ would be scourged into retirement by their indignant masters.”</p>

I am not aware that any State Court has ever yet held a law to be invalid, except where it was clearly forbidden. Certainly, no case of a different character has been cited at the bar. In the many cases which affirm the validity of state laws, this principle is uniformly recognised, either tacitly or expressly. The Supreme Court of the United States has adhered to it on every occasion when it has been questioned there. In Satterlee <em>v. </em>Matthewson (<a href="/us/27/0380-01" class="citation" data-index="57" data-cite="2 Pet. 380" data-case-ids="11338041" data-case-paths="/us/27/0380-01">2 <em>Peters </em>380</a>), an act of the Pennsylvania legislature was censured as unwise and unjust; but, because it came within no express prohibition of the constitution, it was held to be binding on the parties interested; and in Fletcher <em>v. </em>Peck (<a href="/us/10/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="58" data-cite="6 Cranch 87" data-case-ids="530387" data-case-paths="/us/10/0087-01">6 <em>Cranch </em>87</a>), it was declared, that while the legislature was within the constitution, even corruption did not make its acts void. In Calder <em>v. </em>Bull (<a href="/us/3/0386-01" class="citation" data-index="59" data-cite="3 Dall. 386" data-case-ids="11738091" data-case-paths="/us/3/0386-01">3 <em>Dall. </em>386</a>), Mr. Justice Iredell said: “ If a State Legislature shall pass a law, within the general scope of their constitutional powers, the Court cannot pronounce it to be void, merely because it is, in their judgment, contrary to the principles of natural justice. The ideas of natural justice are regulated by no fixed standard, the ablest and the purest men have differed upon the subject; and all the Court, in such an event, could say,'would be that the legislature (possessed of an equal right of opinion) had passed an act, which, in the opinion of the judges, was contrary to abstract principles of right.” Judge Washington, in Golden <em>v. </em>Rice (3 <em>W. C. C. R.), </em>decides that the state legislatures may make such laws as they think fit, unless inconsistent with the powers exclusively vested in the government of the United States, or forbidden by some article of the federal or state constitution. Judge Baldwin, in Bennet <em>v. </em>Boggs (1 <em>Bald. </em>74), has expressed so clearly what I think is the true view of the subject, that I cannot do better than transcribe his words : “We may think,” says he, “the powers conferred by the constitution of this state too great or dangerous to the rights of the people, and that limitations are necessary; but we cannot affix them, or act on cases arising under state laws, as if boundaries h'ad been affixed by the constitution previously. We cannot declare a legislative act void because it conflicts with our opinions of policy, expediency, or justice. We are not the guardians of the rights of the people of the state, unless they are secured by some constitutional provision which comes within our judicial cognisance. The remedy for unwise and oppressive legislation, within constitutional bounds, is by an appeal to the justice and patriotism <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>of the representatives of the people. If this fails, the. people, in their sovereign capacity, can correct the evil ; but Courts, cannot assume their rights.” Chief Justice Marshall, in the Providence Rank Case, says: “The wisdom and justice of the.representative body, and its relations with its constituents, furnish the only security, when there is no- express contract, against, excessive taxation, as well as against unwise legislation generally.” When we come home and look into the precedents established by this Court, we find them uniformly and distinctly denying the right to go beyond the constitution. In Norris <em>v. </em>Clymer, 2 <em>Barr </em>285, Chief Justice-Gibson, with characteristic directness of expression,, declares that, the constitution allows to the legislature every power which it does not positively prohibit.” It was laid down in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>MCloskey (<a href="/citations/?q=2%20Rawle%20374" class="citation" data-index="60" data-cite="2 Rawle 374">2 <em>Rawle </em>374</a>), that if the legislature pass a law within the scope of their constitutional power, the. judicial tribunals have no right to pronounce it void. The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>McWilliams (<a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%2061" class="citation" data-index="61" data-cite="1 Jones 61">1 <em>Jones </em>61</a>), decided that, express prohibition or necessary implication is essential to oust the jurisdiction of the legislature. In. the very last case that came before us. (Hartman <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 5 <em>Harris), </em>it was.decided that the Assembly had Jurisdiction of all cases in which its legislation was not prohibited; that the. law then in question was valid,, because there was no syllable in the constitution to forbid it; and that if a law, unjust in, its operation, and nevertheless not forbidden by the constitution, should be enacted, the remedy lay,, not in an appeal to the judiciary, but to the people, who must apply the, corrective themselves, since they had not intrusted the. power to us.</p>

This principle is asserted by. judges of every grade, both in the federal and in the state courts ; and by some of them it is expressed with much solemnity of language (<a href="/us/10/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="62" data-cite="6 Cranch 87" data-case-ids="530387" data-case-paths="/us/10/0087-01">6 <em>Cranch </em>87</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Dallas%2014" class="citation" data-index="63" data-cite="4 Dallas 14">4 <em>Dallas </em>14</a>; 3 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>178; 12 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>339; 4 <em>Binney </em>123).

It must be remembered that the prohibition to pass any law impairing the obligation of contracts can avail nothing unless the case comes exactly within it. The Supreme Court of the United States in Satterlee <em>v. </em>Matthewson (<a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pet.%20414" class="citation" data-index="64" data-cite="2 Pet. 414">2 <em>Peters </em>414</a>), held that an act, which was retrospective in its operation and took away vested rights, was nevertheless not void under that section in the federal constitution, because it did not literally impair the obligation of a pre-existing contract. I do not say, however, that a contract between two individuals, or between two corporations, can be made by the legislature. That would not be legislation. Besides, it would be impossible in the nature of things; for the essence of a contract is the agreement of the parties. But here is no contract made or attempted to be made by the legislature, but only an authority given to the respective corporations to make one between themselves if they see proper. This authority to make contracts for and in the name of the people is given in a greater or less degree to all public corporations. It is necessary to their existence. All other corporate functions would be nugatory without it. It is constantly exercised by the supervisors of townships, by county commissioners, and by the proper officers of boroughs, districts, <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>and cities. Such contracts can seldom be made with the unanimous approbation of the people, but it has never been thought that a person may not be bound without his consent to perform his share of a <em>public </em>obligation.

No county or municipal tax ever came up to the theory, and the taxes now levied by the state are a grievous violation of it. The improvements made by the Commonwealth added largely to the fortunes of some, to others they did no service, and some were injured by them. Still, all are now compelled to pay for them. It is not, therefore, every inequality of burden or benefit — not every disproportion between the sum which a citizen pays, and the interest which he, as an individual, has in the purpose to which is applied — that can make a tax law void. I am of opinion with the Supreme Court of Kentucky (9 <em>B.

But the right to tax depends on the ultimate use, purpose, and object for which the fund is raised, and not on the nature or character of the person or corporation whose intermediate agency is to be used in applying it. A tax for a private purpose is unconstitutional, though it pass through the hands of public officers; and the people may be taxed for a public work, although it be under the direction of an individual or private corporation.

In some sense money is property, but ;;]when our constitution requires compensation in <em>money </em>to be made for <em>property </em>taken for public use, it marks a distinction between money and property — between value and its measure. But taxation is a public demand, not for <em>property </em>in the sense of the constitution, but for money, or personal services, and that without compensation. True, under most tax laws, property may be seized and sold for default of payment in money, but this only as means to an end, just as the body may be imprisoned if property cannot be found. Nor are these distinctions disproved by the instance put in argument, of money seized to pay troops on the point of mutiny in the face of an invading foe, when it was said, if compensation be made it must be in kind. The answer is, that such a seizure would be neither the exercise of <em>eminent domain, </em>nor of the power of taxation, but of martial law. In adequate emergencies, martial law suspends the habeas corpus, inflicts summary punishments, and appropriates private property, without regard to the guaranties of the constitution. <em>Inter arma silent leges. </em>But in the operations of <em>civil </em>government, the legislature exercises its constitutional sovereignty, sometimes in taking specific property from individuals for a price and devoting it to public use, and sometimes by imposing a tax on property without change of its title or its use.</p>

Strictly speaking, none of the powers of government can be delegated. They are vested in co-ordinate departments to be exercised, and without the right of transfer. But the legislature may provide agencies through whom to exercise the power of taxation, and that is not properly called a delegation or transfer of the power, which is merely an exercise of it through a suitable agent. Accordingly, from the beginning of our government, the legislature have divided the state into counties, townships, school districts, boroughs, and cities, and have provided for the appointment or election of certain tax officers, in their respective localities, and have authorized them to assess, collect, and apply taxes. This has been not so much a delegation of the power of taxation to those municipal divisions as the exercise of it through and by means of chosen agencies. In exact accordance with this kind of legislation, which, having been coeval with the constitution, affords the best interpretation of it, these Acts of Assembly authorize one of the municipal districts of the state “ to make provision for the payment of the money borrowed, as in other eases of loans to said city.” Was this a delegation of a legislative function ? How could the legislature make provision for the repayment of the borrowed money, as in other eases of loans to said city ? Their faculties are all legislative. They have no executive power, and the constitution and habits of the body unfit them for applying rules which it is their province to prescribe. They are obliged to act through chosen agencies when providing for the revenues of the state. State taxes, the internal improvement system, common schools, and all state objects, have to be intrusted to agents, though the power that controls them resides in the legislature. In the same manner, when the legislature would tax the citizens of the city of Philadelphia, to build the railroads in question, they must use the hand* of some agent, and whose could be more wisely selected than that of the “ constituted authorities” of the city ?

Without going into the history and common law of such corporations, I unhesitatingly answer these questions in the negative. There is no congruity between such an enterprise and the legitimate purposes of municipal corporations. They were designed to regulate the internal affairs of the places in which they were located. Police, health, streets, lanes, alleys, and the like, are the appropriate subjects of municipal administration; and though a city may go beyond its boundaries to purchase necessaries for its existence, safety, and comfort, yet its jurisdiction is properly exercised only within its territorial limits, and on subjects that pertain to its domestic economy and well-being. Railroads, to connect distant points of country, to develope physical resources, and to promote commerce, are great public benefactions, and emphatic expressions of the energies of an age distinguished for activity and ' bold adventure. But they come not within or near that class of objects which we have been taught to consider as municipal purposes. Yet when the legislature enables a city to lend a hand to such enterprises, where is the <em>constitutional </em>provision which the judiciary can say is violated ? The power of taxation is unrestrained in the constitution, both as to extent and purpose. Municipal corporations are not defined in the constitution, nor in any general statute. If we go to the common law, that teaches us they may be formed by prescription, by statute, or by royal charter, and that their ordinary purposes are such as I have indicated; but it imposes no restraints on legislative power in respect to them. On the contrary, a learned writer informs us that “ in England the legislature lias not often exercised the power of creating municipal corporations, because it has been esteemed a flower of the prerogative. Where the ordinary regulations alone are necessary, the king incorporates by charter; but when it is thought proper to invest the intended body with any <em>extraordinary </em>power or privilege, the aid of parliament is necessary.” Again: “ The statute may invest the body with powers contrary to the general rules of - law, but they must be granted in clear and unambiguous words.” Again, he says: <em>“ </em>It is quite unnecessary to say what privileges may be granted, or regulations prescribed to a corporation by an Act of Parliament, <em>for the power of the legislature in this respect cannot be defined.” (Willcoclc on Municipal Corporations, </em>sect. 10, 19, and 226.)</p>

The people alone are competent to set bounds to a clearly granted and unquestionable power. The judiciary cannot assign limits to that which the people have decreed shall be unlimited. If they could, the judiciary would be the only real sovereign in the state, and might hinder the most salutary legislation. Are we -to set aside these enactments, because they do not harmonize with our ideas of municipal purposes ? This is the most solid ground to which we have been pointed, but it is not strong enough to sustain such a decree.</p>

For nearly fifty years of our political existence, under the constitution of 1790, no Act of Assembly was set aside for unconstitutionality. Judges claimed the power, and said they would exercise it in clear cases, but in all that period no case arose which, in their judgment, was clear enough to justify the exercise of the power ; and it is well known that that great light of this bench, so recently extinguished, stood opposed, for many years, to the <em>existence </em>of any such judicial power. Since the constitution of 1838 was adopted, several Acts of Assembly have been declared unconstitutional, but they were all clear cases. When the legislature disregards the distribution made of the powers of government, among the three co-ordinate departments — or the restrictive clauses in the body of the instrument — or the reservations of the bill of rights — or the grants to the government of the United States — the judiciary, whose office it is to expound the law, may, and I hold are bound to declare the act unconstitutional and void. But on lower ground than this, and especially on ground so low, as the equivocal and undefined purposes of municipal corporations, Acts of Assembly have never been declared unconstitutional. It was said in the argument, and authorities were exhibited to prove that the constitutionality of legislation, similar to this we are considering, has been asserted in seven states of the confederacy. These concurring opinions of the Courts around us, sitting under state constitutions similar in their structure to ours, are entitled to great respect, and serve to show that the corrective of this species of legislation, novel as it unquestionably is, and pernicious, as many believe, is with the people and not with the courts.</p>

When, therefore, “ the right of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property,” is asserted, it does not mean to exempt property from taxation, since without taxation civil government cannot exist. Nor does it mean to exempt it from the prerogative of <em>eminent domain, </em>for the right to take private property for public use, is elsewhere expressly asserted, and without this also government cannot exist prosperously, if indeed at all. The acquisition, protection, and defence guaranteed, must be consistent with and subordinate to these first principles, else one part of the constitution destroys the other, and so the government is dissolved. I am clearly of opinion, that this section cannot be set up against a tax law. Nor is there any clause in the Declaration of Rights, which restrains the legislative power of taxation. I know this may seem to some a startling proposition, but, rightly considered, there is nothing alarming in it.</p>

And as the tree is best known by its fruits, so are the results of experience the best tests of political theories. In those governments where suffrage and representation have been withheld from the masses, men and property have been taxed to support royalty and aristocracy in costly magnificence — to carry on wars bred by the bad passions of rulers, or to construct expensive and useless works as memorials of individual grandeur. IIow different with us ! Taxation by the general government, indirectly applied, is limited to the necessities of economical administration. Taxation in Pennsylvania, beyond the ordinary purposes of government, has been devoted to the education of the ignorant, the relief of the insane, the dumb, the blind: — to the construction of highways, and bridges, and canals, and railroads. These are the purposes to which a Republican Government applies the power of taxation, and when so applied, it is a beneficent power. Evea <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>though incongruously blended with municipal purposes, as in the instances before us, it is by no means clear that it will not be productive of more good than evil. And that it will never be long perverted to injurious use, is as certain as the law of self-preservation, for so long as the people rule themselves, it is impossible to anticipate that they will employ any of the powers of. government for their own oppression. The fact is, the internal improvements of Pennsylvania, ill-contrived and badly managed as in some instances they have been, have added incalculably to the material wealth of the state, and the taxation they have occasioned, if it seem high as compared with former standards, sinks into insigificance when compared with taxation in other countries, or with the resources of national wealth and greatness which it has multiplied' in our own. It is easy to imagine possible abuses of any unrestricted power, but the voice of our own experience (and I know no safer oracle) teaches us that we may safely trust the interests of the future to that form of government which has been productive of so much happiness and prosperity in the past.</p>

Eor there is a necessary implication arising from the organization and recognition of the judicial branch of the government, that its authority shall be supreme, and its jurisdiction exclusive, upon subjects committed to its care and upon questions to be determined by its judgment. Hence the legislature cannot lawfully grant a new trial in a case once determined. This Court might, with equal right, declare that a bill which had passed through all the forms of legislation, should again be submitted to a vote of the Senate and House of Representatives, and presented to the executive for his approval or rejection, as for the législature to say that a verdict of a jury, and the judgment of a Court, should be set aside, in order to give the parties litigant another opportunity to ascertain where right and justice belong.</p>
