Starting with the principle that all persons ought to contribute to the expenses of government, we should rather presume the contrary. But it is said that the state does not tax the means of education, either secular or religious. True enough, yet it may tax those who make education their business and livelihood. This is certainly as reasonable as taxing the salaries paid by the public itself out of the taxes. The defendant is not however properly an officer of the corporation, but a person in its employment, and his salary ought to be taxed only one per cent, as for an occupation or profession: 5 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>275.</p>
