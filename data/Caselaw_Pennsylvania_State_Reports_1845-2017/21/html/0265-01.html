On the 7th August, 1851, judgment was entered under a rule of Court for want of an appearance. To such judgment error was assigned.</p>

This is necessary, not only that the sheriff may know whom to serve, but that proper intendments may be made in <a id="p266" href="#p266" data-label="266" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*266</a>favor of the record.

    <p id="b266-6" data-blocks='[["BL_266.4",266,[290,545,1165,471]]]'>There is nothing on the record before us from which it can be inferred that Mr. Hulings is a lunatic, and what does not appear of record does not exist in a Court of error. The case presented by the record is that of an alias summons issued against Hulings, and served on Williams. Calling the latter trustee in the sheriff’s return does not help the matter. If it appeared anywhere on the record that Hulings had been found a lunatic, and that Williams was his committee, there would be no difficulty in sustaining the service of the writ. Rut it is simply the ease of a writ against one man, and a service of it on another, and this authorized a judgment against neither.</p>
