      <em>First. </em>The plaintiff must be held to a stricter proof of possession, from the fact that she claims in opposition to her deeds which call for the creek as the boundary; and from the further fact that she crosses the natural boundary, viz., the creek, in order to assert her claim.</p>

      <em>Second. </em>That even if the jury should be of opinion that a certain line was established in 1812, still, if they believe that the defendant and those under whom he claims, have held possession of the premisés for twenty-one years since that time, their verdict must be for defendant.</p>

      <em>Third. </em>That even if the jury are of the opinion that the course of the creek was partially changed by the building of the stone <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>bridge, and thus was gradually extended by the action of the current, freshets, &amp;c., the alteration is the gain or loss of the owners on the different sides, and the creek must still remain the boundary.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b63-5" data-blocks='[["BL_63.4",63,[239,539,1168,301]]]'>
      <em>Fourth. </em>That the words <em>“ </em>near the creek,” in the deed to Steinhauer, calling for <em>“ </em>a stake near the creek” as a boundary, are not to be construed to imply that there was a space between the post or stake and the creek, but merely as indicating the whereabouts of the stake; and that it is not inconsistent with said deed to construe it as referring to a stake close on the banks of the creek, and to the creek as a boundary.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b63-6" data-blocks='[["BL_63.5",63,[238,840,1169,419]]]'>Bell, Justice, charged the jury. — This is an action of ejectment for 116 perches of land lying along Gunner’s run. The plaintiff must recover upon the strength of her own title. She is not permitted to rely on the weakness of her adversary’s title; still she may look to the muniments of title produced by defendant for the purpose of strengthening the ground on which she bases her claim. The plaintiff bases herself on two grounds which admit of being separately considered. One of these is a question of fact for your determination. The other, a mixed question of law and fact.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b63-7" data-blocks='[["BL_63.6",63,[236,1270,1170,386]]]'>The plaintiff’s title began 1690, being a patent to R. Turner for 462 acres. It runs down to 1828, being the will from Anthony Kennedy to Nancy K. Risk. All these call for Gunner’s run as the easterly boundary of the tract owned by plaintiff. One of the intermediate conveyances is dated 1752; this gives the following boundaries: *****. Erom this all the subsequent descriptions are copied, including conveyance to Anthony Kennedy, in 1807. This practice is very usual, indeed universal, when there is no new survey.</p>

Next previous deed is in 1784, Ann Ford to Andrew Caldwell. I think, therefore, no ai'gument against this assertion can be legitimately drawn from this description. But as the deeds all call for the stream as a boundary, it must be taken to be so, unless the plaintiff has satisfied you there was a change in the locality of that stream. The stream is a ‘ natural boundary, and consequently more to be depended on than merely magnetic courses, which is the weakest evidence in cases of this nature. Looking to this part of this case alone, I repeat, the plaintiff is bound <em>prima facie. </em>The onus of showing why she should not be so lies on her. But was the course of that stream changed ? This is the first question. If any change took place, it was by the act of the public authorities, and not a natural and gradual change. It does not, therefore, come within the principle invoked by the defendant, which gives the accretion to the owner of the fortunate side, should it deprive the other of it.</p>

This is not binding as <em>a record; </em>but a dispute of this nature may be definitely settled by an agreement of parties, or by referees appointed by them for that purpose. Did the parties agree to refer ? The entry on the magistrate’s docket — this, of itself, would be insufficient. It was a subject not within his jurisdiction, and therefore his entry of the agreement of the parties proves nothing. But its truth may be established by attendant circumstances, as, 1. The survey by Ihe very persons named on the docket. 2. In the presence of the parties proved by Wirt and Woolman. 3. The planting of stones, remaining for years. 4. The corresponding fence and possession for course of years. 5. The payment of the cost by Mr. Steinhauer.</p>

But possession, to have this effect, must be exclusive, hostile, notorious, and uninterrupted for twenty-one years: a scrambling or mixed possession will not do. Looking to the whole testimony, I confess I see no proof of such possession on the part of the defendant and those he claims under as will satisfy the condition. The fence was not removed, according to witnesses, until 1830, or ’32. But should you be of opinion that there was no agreement to refer, then a question may be, how much of the land in dispute was included in the change of the water of the creek ? The plaintiff is entitled to recover only this, unless you should think she has held adversely for twenty-one years up to the straight line. To establish a possession against the natural boundary of the creek, the proof of it ought to be clear and distinct. This is all I deem necessary to say in reply to point first.</p>
