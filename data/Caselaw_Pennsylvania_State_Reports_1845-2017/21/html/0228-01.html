Howett, at sixty days, for $500, dated April 1,1848. The plea was payment, and the defence relied on appears in the following proposition submitted on the part of <em>the </em>defendant, and affirmed by the Court, viz.: If the note now in suit was discounted to pay a note previously endorsed for Howett by Albright, and which, had been suffered to lie over after due, without protest; and if the bank had suffered Howett to overdraw his account by three or four thousand dollars; and, having discovered his insolvency, said bank procured him to mortgage his property to them for its full value; and then caused him to go to Albright and get his endorsement, they knowing Howett to be wholly insolvent and concealing that fact, and Albright being ignorant of it; and if the directors of said bank, or some of them who had an active agency in the transaction, refused to renew their endorsements for Howett which had lain over without protest, but secured the same by said mortgage, then the procuring of the note in question, in the manner stated, is a fraud, and the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>

This proposition could not be disputed in this case, unless by a mind pre-occupied by the fact that this was a renewal of an old endorsement; but that fact is set aside when it is noticed, that the previous endorsement had been discharged by the omission of demand and notice. It is only saying that he acts fraudulently who secretly changes a state of affairs, and then procures another to do an act, into which the true state of affairs enters as a motive.</p>

A bill of exceptions brings up only the evidence that is relevant to them, and not all the evidence in the cause. The Court is not bound to write down the evidence taken before the jury, nor even to remember it all. At least it is not error in the Court to forget some of it.

A general prayer, for a charge that there is or is not evidence of a particular fact, is easily evaded by the bad memory of the Court; and how can we correct this ? A judge ought to have a good memory and great decision of character; but if he lacks either, a Court of error can do very little to supply the defect. Counsel are entitled to have the principles of law applicable to their client’s ease, clearly presented by the Court to the jury; but this often requires skill on their part, in presenting their points. There is no skill and no point in a request for a charge that there is no evidence of a particular fact. A better way is to call on the opposite counsel to indicate in writing the evidence relied on, and the Court may, in a proper case,, enforce the demand; and then the question will be one of shape. and <em>body, </em>upon which a well defined instruction can be given.
