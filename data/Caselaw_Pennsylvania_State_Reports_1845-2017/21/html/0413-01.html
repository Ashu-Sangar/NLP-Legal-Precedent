    <p class="summary" id="b415-8" data-blocks='[["BL_415.6",415,[184,1064,1170,774]]]'>Annuities bear an affinity to <em>rents. </em>A <em>rent </em>consists in a right to a periodical receipt of money <em>in respect of lands. </em>Other rights to periodical payments are mere annuities. In this case, the payment of $120 annually by the devisee, is not in respect of the lands which he holds under the will, but is in respect of a charge of $2000 fastened upon those lands. It is <em>interest </em>of so much purchase-money, not rent of land. It is a right to a periodical payment secured by being charged on land; and not being a rent is an annuity. In this case the <em>whole </em>land of the devisee is subject to taxation,- without abatement <em>pro tanto </em>as to this charge. He observed that this, however, was an unjust feature in our system of taxation. In the case of Spangler <em>v. </em>York County, 1 <em>Karris </em>322, the fund was to be invested for the use of the widow. But in this case there is simply a suspension of payment of part of the purchase-money, the whole subject devised to the devisee being security for its payment. The devisee holds nothing <em>in trust. </em>It is like a mortgage on his land, of which he is presently to pay interest, and at a future day the principal.</p>

We have repeatedly declared that whatever is not set forth in a special verdict shall be taken not to exist. This being the undoubted and undisputed law of the land, what judgment could we give for the plaintiff, if our opinion should differ from the Court below ? Whether the action is debt, <em>assumpsit, </em>or trespass, does not appear. Nor is it stated that the defendant is in debt to, or committed any injury against, the plaintiff.

But they have no right to get their advice in this way. Courts ought to encourage amicable submissions of real disputes, but people have no right to propound abstract questions to them. For this there is not only the clearest reason, but the highest authority.
