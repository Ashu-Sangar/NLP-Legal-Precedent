If such were the requirements of the law, few wills would stand a test so severe. A superstitious dread of executing such instruments, a timid fear that such execution may be the immediate precursor of death, leads to postponements and delay. And it continually happens that the final disposition of a man’s estate, by his last will, is the last business act of his life. One who is enfeebled and exhausted by the pains and sufferings of a mortal disease, and whose mind is agitated by the hopes and fears of eternity, can hardly be said to have his intellect in a perfect state of integrity. And yet a large portion <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>of wills are made under such circumstances, and are every day sustained in Courts of justice. (A disposing mind and memory, in the view of the law, is one in which the testator is shown to have had, at the making and execution of a last will, a full and intelligent consciousness of the nature and effect of the act' he was engaged in; a full knowledge of the property he possessed; an understanding of the disposition he wished to make of it by the will, and of the persons and objects he desired to participate in his bounty.) The wills of the aged and infirm are alike good, although, when compared with their condition in the vigor of life, the minds of such testators may seem relatively enfeebled; provided they are shown, at the making and execution of such wills, to possess such disposing minds as I have just defined to you.</p>

For general testamentary incapacity, once shown, is presumed to continue until the fact of temporary capacity is established by convincing proofs.</p>

(If from any cause an alleged testator is so enfeebled in mind as to be incapable of knowing the property he possesses; of appreciating the effect of any disposition made by him of it; and of distinctly understanding to whom he intends to bequeath it; he is without the testamentary capacity required to make a valid will.) * * *</p>

In the case before us, the alleged subsequent will was not produced, nor was any evidence given of its loss or destruction, for the purpose of introducing secondary evidence of its previous existence and of its contents.

A judge is acting in the line of his duties when he accompanies his answers with such observations as are necessary to guard the jury against such a result. There are many cases in which affirmative answers to the points put by counsel, although strictly correct as far as they go, would produce an improper effect. It is just that this “effect” should be “impaired” by pertinent “observations” from the judge.
