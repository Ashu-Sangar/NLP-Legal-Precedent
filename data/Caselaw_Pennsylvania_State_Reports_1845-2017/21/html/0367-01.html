The very question is raised, discussed, and thus decided in the case of Cross <em>v. </em>Peters, 1 <em>Greenl. </em>386.

    <p id="b370-7" data-blocks='[["BL_370.5",370,[289,880,1163,642]]]'>And here at the outset; we may reject, as only apparent analogies, some classes of cases that are distinguishable from the one under consideration. We reject the strictness required in the evidence of fraudulent intent in the criminal offence of false pretences ; because a man is chargeable civilly, but not criminally, for the fraud of his agent, and also for the legitimate consequences of a dishonest representation, whether he intended to defraud or not: <a href="/mass/42/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Met. 1" data-case-ids="2042416" data-case-paths="/mass/42/0001-01">1 <em>Met. </em>1</a>; 3 <em>Bar. &amp; Ad. </em>114; 5 <em>Eng.

We reject those moral and legal doctrines which require the strictest honesty in all dealings where one party stands in a relation of special influence or confidence toward the other; for between buyer and seller the law recognises no such relation.</p>
    <p id="b370-8" data-blocks='[["BL_370.6",370,[291,1523,1159,129]]]'>Reduced to its fewest words, the instruction is, that an intention not to pay, and conscious and unrevealed insolvency, make a purchase fraudulent, legally as well as morally. Is it so ?</p>
    <p id="b370-9" data-blocks='[["BL_370.7",370,[292,1650,1161,297]]]'>An intention not to pay is dishonest, but it is not fraudulent: <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%2034" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="9 Watts 34">9 <em>Watts </em>34</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wend.%2081" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Wend. 81">6 <em>Wend. </em>81</a>. The law provides an action on the contract as the remedy for just such dishonesty. And it is no more fraudulent to have such an intention at the time of the purchase than at the time when payment ought to be made. Such intention by itself is disregarded by the law, for it can be set aside by the usual contract remedies.</p>
    <p id="b370-10" data-blocks='[["BL_370.8",370,[291,1948,1161,332]]]'>Nor does insolvency make a sale voidable after delivery: <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wend.%2081" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="6 Wend. 81">6 <em>Wend. </em>81</a>; 2 <em>Mason </em>240. If such were the law there is no calculating the suspicions and disputes which it would nourish. If it were so, the law of stoppage <em>in transitu </em>would be effectually abolished by one of a much more sweeping character. Nor does insolvency combined with an intention not to pay; for it is no more fraudulent in an insolvent, than in a perfectly solvent man, to have such an intention?</p>

If the fact of buying implies an assertion of solvency, then every contract by a man in failing circumstances can be made fraudulent, for, to this implied assertion a jury might add the inference that he had either investigated his affairs and knew his insolvency, or had not, and knew his ignorance ; and then might follow, just as logically, the inference of intention not to pay: 14 <em>State Rep. </em>142. Thus all the elements of fraud contained in the proposition under consideration may be inferred from the mere fact of a subsequent failure, and the contract is avoided for a constructive, rather than an actual fraud. If this were law, it would soon sweep away all the law of contracts, as to persons failing, and a new law of frauds would take its place. On every failure we should have a general scramble among vendors to get back their goods, and suits without number to establish their right by convicting the buyer of fraud. As to the fact of his not revealing his insolvency, some of the above considerations tend to answer it, and it is completely set aside by the principle that no man is under a legal obligation to make known his circumstances when he is buying goods, and no wise dealer would rely upon such representations as a general rule.</p>
    <p id="b371-6" data-blocks='[["BL_371.4",371,[194,1308,1170,333]]]'>We do not forget the maxim <em>apices juris non sunt jura, </em>and think we do not strain the proposition in question by this analysis of it. Insolvency is a state of one’s affairs, and the consciousness of it and the intention not to pay are states of the mind,, and if these constitute fraud, then it may be made out without proof of a single overt fraudulent act. And if none of its elements consist of an overt act, then the law requires no evidence of an overt act to establish it.</p>
    <p id="b371-7" data-blocks='[["BL_371.5",371,[196,1650,1167,559]]]'>We may get a perfectly clear view of this case, by so defining the question as to avoid the danger of an irrelevant conclusion. Where must we look for the fraud ? Not in 'the buyer’s intention merely. It must be a fraud upon the vendor, that is, a fraud acted out. We are seeking to avoid a contract because it was induced by fraud; that is, because there was some fraudulent act leading to it. The very statement of the prqposition excludes the act of purchase from being an element in the fraudulent conduct, and makes it a consequence of it. What then is left but the dishonest intention and the concealed insolvency ? and surely these did not induce the vendor to sell his goods. The error in the other view is in making the purchase a part of the fraud, instead of the object and consequence of it.</p>

And, as between persons standing upon an equal footing, and holding as to each other no relation of influence or trust, all authorities, when <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>they speak clearly on the subject, regard it as essential to actual fraud that the intent to mislead should be acted out by false representations, contrivances, or artifices, or by conduct which reasonably involves a false representation.</p>
    <p id="b372-6" data-blocks='[["BL_372.4",372,[284,568,1164,472]]]'>The rule is proved by the exceptional cases, where special confidence is reposed and influence presumed. Here the law interferes though there be no actual fraud. But where people stand on an equality, the law does not indulge them in reposing such special trust, by helping them out of a difficulty against which they took no pains to guard themselves. It enforces their contracts, not their expectations. It does not hinder people from making foolish bargains, though it does protect them against positive deceit. The state might, in this matter, enlarge its jurisdiction: but its protection is never extended without contracting the limits of individual liberty.</p>

They present no facts by which the seller could be misled; and their only value consists in the light they cast upon the general intentions of the buyer; and in thereby aiding in judging of the fraudulent character of the acts by which the seller was misled in this particular case.
