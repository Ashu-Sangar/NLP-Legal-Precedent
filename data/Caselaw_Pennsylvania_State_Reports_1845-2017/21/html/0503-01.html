That the notary certified, that “he gave-notice in writing to the endorsers, but it was said that notice to affect an endorser was a mixed question <em>of laio and fact.” </em>That if the law did not recognise any other notice to an endorser than <em>personal </em>notice, the notice stated in the protest would be considered to be <em>personal </em>notice. But that the law admitted of notice <em>through the post </em>office, in cases where the endorsers do not reside at the place of protest; and <em>in this case </em>it did not appear whether the notice meant by the notary was personal notice, or notice through the post office. That if the latter was meant, then the post office should have been designated in the protest, that it might appear whether it was the post office nearest to the residence or reputed residence of the endorser: 7 <em>Barr </em>443, Schœneman <em>v. </em>Fegeley; <a href="/wend/19/0383-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="19 Wend. 383" data-case-ids="2023503" data-case-paths="/wend/19/0383-01">19 <em>Wend. </em>383</a>, 2 <em>Supplement to U. S. Digest </em>456. It was contended that it appeared from the protest itself, that the notice meant by the notary was not <em>personal </em>notice to the endorsers, because the Harrisburg Bank, through its cashier, was one of the endorsers, and that notice to that bank must hav-e been through the post office. Also, that the memorandum in pencil mark under the name of the defendant on the note, showed that he resided <em>at Danville, </em>and that therefore the notary, residing in Lebanon, did not give him <em>personal notice </em>on the day of the protest. That this was prohibited by the distance. Thus the law recognises notice <em>through the post office </em>as well as <em>personal </em>notice, and the notary has not certified which he gave; secondly, the remote residence of the endorsers shows that <em>personal </em>notice was not given. A notary should state in the protest what he did. If he gave <em>fersonal </em>notice, it should be stated; and if he gave notice through the post office, he should so state and designate the post office. It was contended that if he does not do so, the protest was indefinite and was not competent proof of notice. That in this case it was attempted to establish by the certificate, <em>hoih the law and the fact. </em>That on the trial of the ease of Bennett <em>v. </em>Young, 6 <em>Harris </em>261, the Court below expressed a doubt whether the certificate in that case was any evidence at all; and that this was held not to be error. That in the case of Bellemire <em>v. </em>Bank U. S., <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Whart.%20113" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Whart. 113">4 <em>Wharton </em>113</a>, it was said, that “ the official character of the notary extends only to the protest, and not to the hunting up of the parties; that neither he nor the bank is bound to know any one in the transaction but the last endorser.” It was said, that in eases like the present, where one bank sends a note to another, the usage is for the notary employed by the collecting bank, to send all the notices to the <em>first </em>bank.</p>

In the case of Jenks <em>v. </em>Doylestown Bank, 4 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>510, the certificate of the notary was that He had notified the endorser by mail, of the non-payment of the note; and whether this fact, thus proved <em>primd fade, </em>was refuted either by the testimony of the notary or of others, was for the jury. In the case of Bennett <em>v. </em>Young, cited contrá, the notary attempted to certify the quality of the search made by him; but as that depended on <em>the acts </em>done by him, the Court held that a notary was bound to certify the <em>acts </em>done by him, that the Court might judge whether the search was diligent or not.</p>
