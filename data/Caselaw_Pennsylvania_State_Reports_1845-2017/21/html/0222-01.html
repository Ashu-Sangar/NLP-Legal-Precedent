In the articles of partnership Kauffelt engaged to furnish at his expense, <em>the services of a competent cleric as assistant. </em>It was alleged on the part of the minor that he rendered the service not for the firm, hut for Kauffelt. The father was examined on the part of the plaintiff, under exception, and he testified that he made no claim to his son’s wages. That he told his son before he commenced the service, that all he earned should be his own. He said he never told this to Kauffelt; that Kauffelt told him to tell his son to come there. He said there was no agreement as to wages. He said the partnership was dissolved.</p>

A minor son, authorized by his father to go out to service, and receive his earnings for his own use, may maintain an action for his wages against his employer, although such authority by the father has not been made known to the employer when the minor entered into the service ; and if in such case, no express contract be made with the employer, the law will imply a promise by him to the minor, and not to'the father: <a href="/mass/36/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="19 Pick. 29" data-case-ids="2037583" data-case-paths="/mass/36/0029-01">19 <em>Pick. </em>29</a>.</p>

The law implies contracts according to the facts appearing to the minds of the parties. When a minor is permitted, by his father, to make his own contract for service, it is fair to presume that he is allowed also to receive the wages for himself, and so the law implies the contract until a contrary purpose appears. But it is not so when the father himself makes the contract. He has a right to command the services and receive the wages of- his minor son, and when he makes a contract for them, there is no ground for the presumption that he is acting as agent of his son, or that the other party knows it, and intends the contract to be with the son; and therefore the law cannot imply that such was the contract as matter of fact, or impose it as matter of duty. The private arrangement between the father and son in this case, was a matter of their own, which constitutes no part of the transaction, and which is indeed revocable at the father’s pleasure. To allow a recovery by the son in such a case, might defeat just claims of Kauffelt against the father.</p>
