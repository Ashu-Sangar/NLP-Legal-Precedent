The part which was suggested to be <em>vacated </em>began at or near a corner of land of Bomberger and Neivcomer, thence, about a mile in distance, to the house of Coover, which was situate at a point of junction with a road leading to McCune’s mill. The road proposed to be laid out, <em>instead of the fart to be vacated, </em>began at or near the corner of lands of Bomberger and Newcomer, thence to a point at or near Oak Grove school-house. The schoolhouse was on a public road leading from Coover’s past the schoolhouse towards McCune’s mill, and it was about 141 perches distant from Coover’s.</p>

The 18th section of the Act of 1836 seems to have been intended to meet such a case as this one. The Act provides that the Court shall have power upon petition “ to change or vacate the whole <em>or any part </em>of any private or public road.” It does not necessarily follow that both the termini of the road prayed for shall be upon the route of the old road. If the petitioners had prayed for a public road from Bomberger’s to the “ Oak Grove School-House” and no more, the viewers might not have sanctioned such a road, for the reason that the old road ran so nearly between the same points that both were not necessary. If they had prayed for the vacation of the old road alone, that might not have been sanctioned, because one road was absolutely necessary. No good could have resulted from so shaping the peti<a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>tion as would have required the viewers to run over the public road from “ Oak Grove School-House” to “ Coover’s,” and although the Court say in 2 <em>Bawle </em>422 that it will do no harm, yet that it is unnecessary.</p>

It is desired to vacate an old road, which has become useless, inconvenient, and burdensome ; and to supply it by another. But the best way to supply it is to use another road already established for part of the distance. In “Hess’s Mill Road” we held that the viewers might adopt such portions of the other old road as <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>they thought proper, though the petition made no reference to it, hut merely prayed in general terms that the road to be vacated might be supplied by another, to be laid out in lieu of it. In the present case, the petition asked for the vacation of a road from Bomberger’s to Coover’s, and that it might be supplied by a new road from Bjfomberger’s to Oak Grove School-House, which, at the latter point, would intersect another road (McCune’s mill road), running thence to Coover’s. By this means the parts of the old road not vacated are connected together. If this could have been done by the viewers on their own judgment, I know of no principle which makes it the worse, because the petitioners also desired it, and expressed their wish for it. Oak Grove School-House was not an intermediate point, but the terminus of the new road. It was not necessary to re-survey or lay out anew McCune’s mill road, and therefore it was proper enough to make the school-house the terminus.</p>
