    <p class="summary" id="b359-12" data-blocks='[["BL_359.9",359,[211,1872,1161,258]]]'>This was an action of replevin brought by John and Peter Lauck, as partners, <em>v. </em>William M. Henderson, administrator of the estate of James Preston, deceased, for 742 bushels of corn, of the value of $371, delivered to Preston on 12th April, 1852, at a mill which Preston had on lease.

On the 19th, 25th, and 28th of March, 1852, one of the plaintiffs delivered the corn at the mill, and as each load was delivered he took a receipt, stating it to he for the use of Preston. It was thrown on a pile with other <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>corn then in the mill, in his presence, and without objection. When he delivered the last load, on the 28th of March, Preston was ill. After Lauck delivered the corn, and saw it placed on the pile with other corn, he took the receipts, and went to Carlisle, and found that Preston was so ill that he could not see him. In the afternoon he returned to the mill, and notified the miller that he had not been paid, and would reclaim the corn. Thus matters stood until after Preston’s death, which took place on the 30th March, 1852, after which Henderson took out letters of administration on his estate. Lauck afterwards came to the mill, and was proceeding to measure off corn from the pile to the extent of the quantity which he had delivered. Henderson objected, on the ground that his corn could not be identified, and the action of replevin was instituted. It appeared that several lots of corn had been thrown on the same pile. That delivered by Lauck was the last which was thrown on the heap. There were six or seven hundred bushels on the pile before Lauck delivered that which he brought. The rest of the corn on the pile belonged to Preston. The corn of the Laucks was to be paid for as soon as the last of it was delivered; it was not paid for.</p>
