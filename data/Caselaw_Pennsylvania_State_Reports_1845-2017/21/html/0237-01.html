But . if pledged as , collateral security merely, the title .remained in ...Capron-•&amp; Co„ and the consideration would be open to inquiry; and then if the jury should be satisfied that the new notes were .founded in no new consideration, but were only renewals of the <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>original note, the defence set up would be as applicable to one of the new notes as it would have been to the original note. This inquiry became thus a vital question on the last trial, and out of the evidence offered in regard to it, bills of exception resulted, which may be properly noticed at this place.</p>

The note which Capron &amp; Co. had endorsed, had been given up by the holder without the knowledge or assent of the endorsers, and the note in suit had been taken in lieu of it. This discharged the liability of the endorsers beyond a doubt. But that note was assigned as a collateral security merely, says the defendant, and the money recovered in this action will go to the benefit of the owners of the collateral, and therefore the witness had a direct interest in the event of this suit. Whether assigned as a collateral or not, is, as we have seen, an open question in the cause, but for the purposes of this objection we must assume that it was. William Muirhead, then, as the holder of a collateral, was bound to preserve it or collect it, and apply it for the benefit of the assignor. He might not waste it, or exchange it for an inferior security, and doing either, he made himself accountable for it. A bond, or <em>chose, </em>which is transferred as collateral security, is put under the dominion of the creditor, to make his claim out of it. It is not in the nature of, or subject to the incidents of a pawn, or pledge: Ins. Co. <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20127" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Jones 127">1 <em>Jones </em>127</a>, by Coulter, J. His duties in respect to it are active. He is to employ reasonable diligence in collecting the money on the security, and applying it to the principal debt, and a conversion of it into a less security is such misuse as makes him accountable to the debtor. When William Muirhead gave up the $500 note, and took notes for it against William Kirkpatrick alone, he not only released Capron &amp; Co. from liability to him as endorsers, but he incurred liability to them for releasing Ephraim Kirkpatrick from the paper. From that mo<a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>ment he was bound to account to Capron &amp; Co. for their note. How, then, was Jonathan Muirhead interested in the event of this suit? If the plaintiff recovered, the argument is, he would have to account to Jonathan as a member of the firm of Capron &amp; Co. The answer is, he had fixed upon himself a liability to account, whether he recovered in this action or not, and therefore the witness was not interested in his recovery. Never having been a party to the note in suit, and not interested in the event of the action, we hold that Jonathan Muirhead was a competent witness,1 and that the Court erred in rejecting him.</p>

I do not overlook the fact that the judge, in answering the plaintiff’s points, particularly the third and the ninth, submitted to the jury the question of a new consideration, so far as the extension of time would be a new consideration; but this was only one of the elements of the alleged new consideration; and the language quoted from the reported case was a very emphatic intimation that the Supreme Court considered the extension of time, even in connection with the giving up Ephraim Kirkpatrick, no new consideration whatever. It is difficult, indeed, to doubt that the jury must have considered the whole subject of consideration settled by the language with which the charge concludes, and yet that language, so far as it was borrowed from this Court, consisted of <em>obiter dicta, </em>which were predicated of a hypothesis that the learned judge who indulged it, intimated might be unfounded. The consideration of the new note, in its nature, and by express authority, a question for the jury, was thus virtually withdrawn from them, and ruled against the plaintiff, almost as distinctly as on the former trial it was ruled against the defendant. The testimony of Houseal is the only evidence on the record that touches the transaction of the 11th March, 1842; and the jury should have been instructed, that if he was believed, a new and independent consideration had been shown.</p>

Again, on the 11th of March, 1842, there was a pending doubt (not yet solved indeed) whether the $500 note was transferred in payment of, or as collateral security for existing liabilities; and important legal consequences depended on this question.
