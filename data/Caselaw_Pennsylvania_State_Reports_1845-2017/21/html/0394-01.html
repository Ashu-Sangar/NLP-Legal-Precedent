On 7th July, 1829, Henry Stoner, and other heirs of John Alleman, including his widow, released the executors from all claims on account of said estate, and acknowledged that they had received the same <em>in full, </em>each specifying the amount received on account of the land in Ohio, and acknowledging the payment of the balances due them respectively.

Under tho facts proved, you can therefore have but little difficulty in coming to the conclusion, that Henry Stoner received the whole share of money arising from the sale of the homestead farm and the land in the state of Ohio, after his wife’s death; but as the plaintiff has failed to show that the house and lots in Middletown were sold after that period, he has established no claim to recover that portion of the money. He was entitled to the rents so long as the real property remained unsold, and to the interest of the money so long as he lived, as tenant by the curtesy, provided the estate descended to his wife, as lands of which she died seised. If this property had <em>definitely </em>and <em>imperatively </em>affixed to it, the character of money by the will of John Alleman, then Henry Stoner had a right to receive and retain it. If it descended to his wife as land, he had only the use of it for life, and his estate must now account for it to his daughter, the heir-at-law of his deceased wife.</p>
