By that Act commissioners were appointed to survey the streets, roads, and lanes laid out within certain bounds defined in the Act, and also to lay out such other streets and roads within the district as they shall deem necessary, &amp;c., and making it their duty, after having made such survey and laid out such streets and roads as they shall deem proper as aforesaid, to make or cause to be made a correct draught or plan thereof, &amp;e., and return it to the Court of Quarter Sessions of the county of Philadelphia, &amp;c. Public notice of its being filed was directed to be given, and that on a certain day designated, the Court would hear objections to it. 'The preamble to the 4th section was as follows: And, whereas, the public convenience will be at present answered by the certain knowledge where and in what manner such streets, roads, and lanes will in future run, but it will not be necessary immediately to lay them all open; in order, therefore, to provide for the opening of the same from time to time, as the increasing improvements may require. And it was enacted by the 4th section,- That upon the petition of any number of the citizens of said township, not less than twenty, whose lands lie near or adjoining to such streets, roads or lanes, it shall and may be lawful for the Court of Quarter Sessions, after hearing the petitions, and such freeholders through <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>whose land such street or road shall pass as shall offer objections thereto, to appoint viewers to report whether it be proper at the time to open such street or road ; and if they shall be of opinion, that the state of improvement in the neighborhood thereof shall require it, they shall issue an order to the supervisors of the roads, in the township of Passyunk, requiring and enjoining them to open such street or road, and to cause the same to be put in order and kept in repair, in the same manner as other streets are bylaw to be opened repaired and maintained, and the owner or owners of ground through and over which any of the streets or roads shall pass shall proceed in the same manner to obtain indemnification for any injury they may sustain thereby, as if the said streets or roads had been opened in the manner usually pursued for opening roads.</p>

That the Act of 1842 required a survey of the roads, &amp;c., already laid out and within the borough; and that there were roads and. streets then laid out within the part of the borough which were not embraced in the plan of 1843.</p>

If the case stood upon the footing of an ordinary power of appointment or revocation, the law is, that the power need not be executed to the utmost extent at once, but may be executed at different times over different parts of the estate: 1 <em>Sugd. on Powers </em>357. But the ease does not rest solely on this ground. By the Act of 13th July, 1842, the committee appointed by the Burgess and Council were not only empowered to make the survey, but were expressly <em>“ enjoined </em>and <em>required” </em>to do so. There is a difference between a <em>naked </em>power, which lies at the election of the party to execute or not, .at his pleasure, and an <em>official duty </em>which he is under a legal obligation to perform. In the latter case the preservation of the public rights demands that the <em>whole duty </em>be performed; and where no time is. prescribed within which it is to be completed, the performance of part at one time, is no reason why the residue should not be performed at another. Where a power to graduate the streets was given to the corporation of Georgetown, it was held to be a continuing power to be exercised from time to time: <a href="/us/19/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Wheat. 593" data-case-ids="11731354" data-case-paths="/us/19/0593-01">6 <em>Wheat. </em>593</a>. In this case, the survey of the southern portion of the borough at one time, is no reason why the northern portion should not be surveyed at another.</p>
