The plaintiff was a passenger in the defendant’s cars, on a journey from New York to Philadelphia, on the 27th day of August, 1849. In the course of the journey the cars pass over the Delaware and Raritan Canal, at Trenton. The cars pass the canal by a bridge, the side of which, opposite the window, where the plaintiff was sitting, is lined or sheathed with weather-boarding, so as to present a smooth, plain, unbroken surface, from each end of the bridge to the king post (or post in the centre of the bridge), with which it is in line, the king post forming a part of the sheathing; so that any projection from the window, would impinge against the face of the post opposite the window. At this post it was alleged that the plaintiff’s arm was broken. A curve existed on the bridge.</p>

A carrier of passengers is bound to omit no precaution that may conduce to their safety. He is bound to guard before hand against every apparent danger that may beset them. The dangers incident to travelling in railway cars, are few in comparison with those incident to other modes of travel; but among the most prominent of them, is risk of injury to limbs stuck out of. the windows, where the cars are not so constructed as to prevent it. Any one who has travelled by <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>railway, must have observed that even the most careful passengers forget the risk, and unconsciously suffer their elbows to slip out beyond the window sill. What can the carrier do to prevent it ? <em>* * * </em>No more is required than a few metallic rods set in the</p>

None of these would materially impede the circulation of the air, or abridge the comfort of the passengers, while it would make their 'safety sure. (A car without any of these appliances, is, to coin a phrase, not road-worthy, and a carrier is responsible for any loss that may happen from that cause alone.) Risking his passengers in an unsafe car, it behoves him to use every means in his power to guard against danger from it at dangerous places, by audibly proclaiming in the car the necessity of keeping arms and heads inside. If any one should disregard such warning, he would incur the charge of wilful neglect of his own safety; and when there is negligence on both sides, neither party is answerable for any injury from it. It is not pretended that the passengers were warned not to put out their arms in passing this bridge, and so far the case is against the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b205-7" data-blocks='[["BL_205.5",205,[215,1241,1166,806]]]'>“Rut even verbal warning might not protect the carrier in every case. It would be of no service to a foreigner ignorant of the language, or to a sleeping passenger, or to a child incapable of reason. The utmost care of a parent or nurse, is insufficient to restrain a child’s curiosity to look at things ‘ outside. Should either of these be injured by want of a proper construction of the car, an action would lie for it. Nor would written notice stuck up be any better. There may be passengers who can’t read, and they would, of course, not be affected by it. Others may get into the ear at night, and some might not observe it even in day time, and neither of these would be chargeable with negligence. At best, however, such notice is too general to be of service. It gives no more than general information, known to everybody without it, that injury may result from putting heads or limbs through the windows. .It would seldom be recollected at the critical moment; but it would be otherwise in regard to particular information at a particular time of a particular danger at a particular place. Surely a written notice is not an equivalent for a properly constructed car. But there was not even that.</p>

A man who would choose to loll on the window sill with his head, arms, and a part of his body hanging outside of it, would not ride like a prudent man or a gentleman, and he would have to bear the consequences of his foolhardiness.

(That would be true in regard to a passenger who was standing on one of the platforms to enjoy his cigar, the air, or the prospect; the risk of danger from his position would be extraordinary, and exposure to it would be rash as well as wilful; but in regard to leaning on the window sills the case would be different. A passenger is not entered as a bale of goods, nor is he bound to behave like one. He is entitled to all the comforts which change of position and change of place may afford. He may have his elbows on the window sills, ride back foremost or face foremost, and the occupants of adjoining benches may reverse one of them for purposes of conversation, as was done in this case, without incurring the charge of remissness in not keeping a sharp lookout. A person who dare not put his nose out of the car, could not discover that a post was coming. Nor are all the duties of the carrier to his passengers performed, when the conductor puts him into the car and leaves him to shift for himself. He is bound to guard him from every danger which extreme vigilance can prevent. The passenger has put his life into his hands, and the carrier is bound to defend it as his own. In the present case, it would seem that every precaution was neglected, inasmuch as there was neither a properly constructed car, nor a verbal warning of danger, nor even the miserable and insufficient substitute, a written caution.)</p>

The language of the learned judge who presided at the trial, seems to be too broad as a general principle, where he says that “ no car is good if the windows are not so constructed as to prevent the passengers from putting their limbs through them.” But in its application to a road, which in some places is so narrow as to endanger projecting limbs, as here, the instruction is proper. Judgment affirmed.</p>
