The defendants’ counsel has produced us a list of two hundred and seventy-nine acts of Assembly, passed only within the last four years, creating one, and enlarging the powers of another corporation, or enlarging the powers of two corporations, both municipal and private.

The law questioned in Norris <em>v. </em>Clymer (2 <em>Barr </em>277), was sustained by this Court principally because there had been many laws like it, and l’ights had grown up under them which it would be mischievous to annihilate. And the Supreme Court of the United States have declared (<a href="/us/36/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="11 Pet. 257" data-case-ids="3344300" data-case-paths="/us/36/0257-01">11 <em>Peters </em>257</a>), that the uniform exercise of an important power almost without question is no unsatisfactory evidence that the power is rightfully exercised.</p>

It is argued that this is not an exertion of legislative power by the assembly, but a mere delegation of it to the people of Reading. We cannot see it in that light. Half the statutes on our books are in the alternative, depending on the discretion of some person or persons to whom is confided the duty of determining whether the proper occasion exists for executing them. But it cannot be said that the exercise of such a discretion is the making of the law. New privileges, conferred on a public corporation, need not be absolute and peremptory, so as to force them on the members against their consent. When individuals or corporators are merely authorized to do a thing, the doing of it necessarily depends on their own <em>will; </em>and we can see no reason why the acceptance of a new power, tendered to a public corporation, may not be made to depend on the will of the people when it is expressed by themselves, as well as when it is spoken by the mouths of their officers and agents.</p>
    <p id="b202-7" data-blocks='[["BL_202.5",202,[330,1618,1164,558]]]'>The case of Parker <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth (6 <em>Barr </em>507), has been cited, and much ingenuity has been expended in the effort to make the principle there decided cover the facts which exist here. I do not propose to discuss it. In the case of the Cin., Wilm., &amp; Zanesville R. R. Co. <em>v. </em>The Commissioners of Clinton County, very recently decided by the Supreme Court of Ohio, and not yet regularly reported, all the authorities which bear on the point, our own among them, are very carefully and ably reviewed. The opinion of the Court contains a full and convincing refutation of the plaintiffs’ argument here. When that case and the case of Slack <em>v. </em>The Maysville &amp; Lexington R. R. Co., determined by the Supreme Court of Kentucky, shall come to be in the books, they will leave but little more to be expected or desired on the subject.</p>
    <p id="b202-8" data-blocks='[["BL_202.6",202,[334,2173,1157,88]]]'>But there is one view not distinctly taken by either of those courts, which I will add, because it strikes me as very conclusive.</p>
    <p id="b202-9" data-blocks='[["BL_202.7",202,[334,2259,1157,87]],["BL_203.1",203,[233,428,1168,559]]]'>When the city was chartered, the legislature' had a right to prescribe, and did prescribe, how its municipal affairs should be ad<a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>ministered. They ordained that this should be done by two bodies called the Select and Common Councils. But they had the power to give it a very different organization. They could have made its government as purely democratic as that of Athens, requiring the people in their primary capacity to decide every question for themselves. Having this power at first, and there being nothing to forbid an alteration in the charter of a city, they could afterwards change it so as to increase the power of the people, and diminish that of the councils. This, in point of fact, is all that has been done. The law of 1853 is but an amendment of the charter, and declares that with reference to this affair of a railroad subscription the city shall be governed, not by the councils alone, but by the councils and the people together.</p>
    <p id="b203-6" data-blocks='[["BL_203.2",203,[230,987,1170,642]]]'>IV. There is another objection to this subscription, which, though comparatively unimportant as a general principle, is much more serious than any of the rest in its effect on this case. The law says that in case the constituted authorities shall propose to subscribe, it shall be their duty to fix upon a time for holding an election, &amp;c. I am of opinion that this made it the duty of the councils to meet separately, to deliberate on the question, and to decide it, before ordering an election — that the people had no more than a veto on the decision of the councils — and that an election before a formal proposal by the con'stituted authorities is void. Of this opinion also is Mr. Justice Lowrie. But the three other judges think differently. There is therefore no point in the cause on which a majority is willing to decree an injunction. Such a decree cannot be made either on the first or fourth without basing it on a foundation which the Court decide to be illegal.</p>
    <p id="b203-7" data-blocks='[["BL_203.5",203,[542,1629,811,42]]]'>The motion for a special injunction is refused.</p>
    <p id="b203-8" data-blocks='[["BL_203.6",203,[276,1714,669,42]]]'>Lewis, J., and Lowrie, J., dissented.</p>
