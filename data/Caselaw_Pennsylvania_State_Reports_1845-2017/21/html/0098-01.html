The widow of an intestate, <em>before </em>taking out letters of administration, held a vendue of her late husband’s property, and sold a eanal-boat to the defendant, on three months’ credit, the purchaser to give security for his purchase before delivery. About five months afterwards, the widow obtained letters of administration, and brought suit for the price of the boat:</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b98-9" data-blocks='[["BL_98.8",98,[322,1091,1160,255]]]'>This was an action of <em>assumpsit by </em>Eve Licht, administratrix of the estate of Joseph Licht, deceased, <em>v. </em>Henry Sellers, to recover the price of a canal-hoat. The boat belonged to her husband at his death, and <em>before administration, </em>viz., on 30th December, 1846, she sold it at public sale, and it was purchased by Sellers.</p>

The boat was not moved, but it was testified that the defendant employed a person to clean it out. On the part of the defendant it was alleged that possession of the boat had not been delivered by the plaintiff, and that the vendee had disaffirmed the contract of sale before grant of letters of administration. No security wab given. On 24th May, 1847, the plaintiff received letters of administration on her husband’s estate.</p>

He further charged, “ up to that time, he (the defendant) had a right to rescind the purchase. Did he ever do that; did he say or do anything which evinced an intention, before that day, to renounce and give up his purchase ? That is the question of fact which it is for you to determine from the evidence on both sides.”</p>

      <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>Error was assigned, 1. To the first part of the charge quoted, it being alleged that the jury should have been instructed that, under the circumstances, the sale conferred no title and imposed no obligation on the purchaser. 2. That the remarks of the Court were calculated to mislead the jury as to the question of delivery. 8. That the Court charged that the confirmation of a voidable sale <em>by the vendor alone </em>was sufficient to bind the vendee, notwithstanding his disaffirmance. 4. That the Court limited the right of rescission by the purchaser to the time of the grant of letters of administration. 5. That there was no evidence that those letters had been exhibited to Sellers. 6. That the charge taken together was calculated to mislead the jury. 7. To the admission in evidence of the Sale made by the plaintiff in her private capacity.</p>

If the latter, the learned judge was right in saying that, if Sellers did not renounce the sale until her title was perfect and the sale confirmed by her demand of the price, then he was bound to pay. He could not complain of a sale and delivery <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>without title, if the title' was complete when payment was demanded.</p>

There was some equivocal evidence that Sellers exercised acts of ownership, but she refused to deliver without security, and perhaps did not deliver, and this fact ought not to have been assumed. The Court ought to have instructed the jury how to treat the case if they found that there was no delivery and no, assumption of possession which she might treat as equivalent. But this view is excluded when the Court says : “ Did he do anything (before administration granted) which evinced an intention to renounce his purchase ? That is the question for you to determine.”</p>
