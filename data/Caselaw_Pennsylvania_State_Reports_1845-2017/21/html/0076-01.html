Where one partner sells his interest to another, in consideration of an engagement by the latter to pay the partnership debts, the rule is the same. The engagement to pay them is but a personal contract. It creates no lien on the property.

R. </em>198; Campbell <em>v. </em>Mullet, 2 <em>Swanst. </em>552, and other authorities. Lord Eldon, in Ex parte Ruffin,' seemed to think that if the right to dispose of the assets did not exist in the partners, “ no partnership could ever arrange its affairs.” And Chief Justice Gibson has shown, in Doner <em>v. </em>Stauffer, that after a sale of the interest of one partner, the equity and the interest of the remaining partner is the subject of sale on a separate execution against him, which passes the entire interest to the purchaser. And that where the interest of each is sold on separate executions for their individual debts, the partnership creditors can neither follow the property in the hands of the sheriff ’s vendee, nor claim any portion of the proceeds of sale. There can be no stronger illustration than this of the principle that the partnership creditors have no equity of their own upon which they can enforce a preference, or control the partners in exercising dominion over their assets, so long as they remain unencumbered by liens.</p>
    <p id="b83-6" data-blocks='[["BL_83.4",83,[230,1572,1169,685]]]'>If the property from which the fund in Court arises had been assigned for the benefit of the creditors of the second firm, composed of the three brothers, a question might arise whether, by their agreement to pay the debts of the first firm, they did not convert those debts into debts of the second. But it is not necessary to discuss that question, inasmuch as the assets have been assigned for the benefit of the creditors of the last firm, composed of the two brothers. As the whole right of property existed in those two brothers, at the time of the assignment, their right to appropriate it to the payment of the partnership debts of the firm to whom it belonged is clear and unquestionable. The Act of 1843 does not stand in the way of such an assignment. That Act was not intended to deprive partners of their legal and equitable right to appropriate partnership assets to the payment, without preference, of all the debts of the firm to whom the property belonged at the time of the assignment.</p>

This is the pinch of the case. They were all originally creditors of the <em>first </em>firm. McGrowan afterwards became a creditor of the <em>second. </em>But neither of them is a creditor of the <em>third, </em>unless he has become so without his knowledge or consent, by the sale made by Nathan Yearsley to his his brother John, and by the act of John in bringing his interest thus purchased, into the new partnership, composed of himself and his brother James. It is not necessary to cite authorities to prove that it takes at least two to make a bargain. Nothing can be clearer than that these transactions between the partners created no contract with their creditors. No creditor could thereby be compelled to release his demand against five for the more uncertain security of a claim against two. These transfers neither discharged the original partners, nor imposed upon the subsequent firm any new liabilities to the creditors of the first. And they furnish no foundation whatever for an action by the creditors of the two first firms against the partnership last established. A creditor without a right of action is a legal impossibility. If John, when he purchased the interest of Nathan, had agreed with the latter to pay the debts of the old firm, this would not have made them his creditors; and if it had, they would not thereby have become the creditors of the new partnership about to be established. But we have no evidence of the terms of this sale, or of the consideration upon which John brought his interest into the new partnership with James, and afterwards united with him in applying the assets to the debts of that firm. The effect of the sale by Nathan to John was to dissolve the old firm, and to transfer Nathan’s interest in the assets to John, <em>subject to the right of James to insist on applying them in the first place to the payment of the liabilities of the old firm. </em>This right he might insist upon or waive, at his pleasure. That he waived it is demonstrated by his application of the assets to other purposes. To allow creditors of the two first firms to claim any portion of this fund would invert the well established principle that the preference of partnership creditors is not founded upon any equity of their own, but must always be worked out through the agency of the partners; it would destroy, without authority of law, the necessary dominion which every man has over his own property, and give the control to those who have fairly transferred all their rights to others. To class these claimants as creditors of the last firm, without their consent, without the consent of the last firm, without any release of their claims against their original debtors, and without any contract or consideration whatever, would be to create a liability where none existed either by the contracts of the parties, or by the law of the land. <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>To permit this would be an illegal interference with the rights of the creditors of the last firm, and a palpable violation of the terms of the assignment.</p>
