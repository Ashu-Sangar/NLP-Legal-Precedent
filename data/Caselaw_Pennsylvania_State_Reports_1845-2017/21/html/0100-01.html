And where the owner is absent, which means beyond the reach of process, or is under age, insane, <em>feme </em>covert, or otherwise legally incapacitated to contract, it is indispensable that the Court should make such appointments of guardians, and such decrees and orders concerning notice, as may be necessary to protect the interests to be affected.
