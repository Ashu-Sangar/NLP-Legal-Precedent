As the law then stood, the husband was immediately seised of an estate for life in right of his wife, and entitled to all the issues and profits thereof as his own property. On the 28th December, 1850, the husband conveyed his interest in the land to Jacob Eehl, who, on the 13th January, 1851, conveyed it to the wife; but the conveyance to Eehl has been tried on correct principles, and found to be fraudulent as to this creditor. The result of course is, that he has a right to treat the land as the husband’s for life, and it is very difficult to prove so plain a corollary as his right to levy on the crops, which, as to him, ought to be and are the husband’s. The Act of 1848 has nothing to do with the case ; for it does not mean to take away any previously vested rights of the husband, or to <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>allow him to give them away in fraud of his creditors.
