Early in the year 1849 he lost a son by death who had always lived with him, and for many years attended to his business, and had been engaged also in business for himself, named <em>Thomas Davidson </em>Urie, who' died <em>unmarried. </em>The plaintiff, <em>Thomas Davidson </em>Parker, was called after this son, and was a relation. When. <em>Thomas D. Crie </em>was on his death-bed, he told his father, Thomas Urie, that he wished certain persons whom he named, to receive of his estate specified articles and sums of money as gifts from him. Among this number, he desired that Thomas Davidson Parker, having been named after him, should receive five hundred dollars. His father, Thomas Urie, promised him that his request should be fulfilled, and after the death of his son Davidson, took out letters of administration on his estate, and took possession of all his property. On the 17th March, 1849, he filed an inventory of the estate of his son, in which he charged himself, among other things, with a bond of David Miller, dated September 3d, 1847, for $800. All the gifts or bequests of Thomas D., made as aforesaid, were strictly carried out in accordance with the spirit of the request of the son and the promise of the father, during the father’s lifetime, <em>with the exception </em>of the payment of the $500 to Thomas D. Parker, and he frequently expressed his intention of paying this. Thomas Davidson Urie’s' estate was more than sufficient to pay all the gifts and bequests that he made.</p>

D. 1849, Thomas Urie (the father) <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>employed counsel to draw up his will, hy which he disposed of all his property among his surviving children, grandchildren, and some others. (The will was left in the possession of counsel, who resided in Carlisle.) Sometime in September, A. D. 1849, Thomas Urie made a visit to Lewistown, in Mifflin county, where he was suddenly taken ill. He sent for an attorney in that place, to whom he communicated the fact of his having made a'will, which was then in Carlisle, and that he wished to make some alterations. A codicil, drawn to his instructions, was executed, and by it Mr. Urie made a different disposition of part of his property from that made in the will.</p>

He then mentioned the dying wish of his son Thomas D. Urie, that Thomas D. Parker should receive the $500 aforesaid; and said he desired that to be carried out, and that he wished his executors to pay Thomas D. Parker five hundred dollars. The counsel mentioned to him that he would have to write another codicil — that the executors would not be safe in paying it without its being in the will or codicil. He replied that he was too weak to sign another, but that he should tell Richard Parker (one of the executors appointed in his will) to pay over five hundred dollars to Thomas D. Parker, and he would do it. The counsel again stated that it would not be good in his opinion, unless it was in the will or codicil. Mr. Urie then mentioned this bond that he held against David Miller for the sum of $800, and called upon the by-standers to witness, that “ he now transferred $500 of that bond to Thomas D. Parker,” and requested the counsel to inform Richard Parker that he had done so.</p>

Urie said, <em>“ </em>No ; the bond was not his, — that he did not want it to be considered a gift <em>from Mm,• </em>— that it was <em>Ms son </em>Davidson's.” The counsel then remarked to him, that he had better make <em>a transfer of it. </em>Urie remarked, “ that the bond was too large, — more than the amount that Thomas D. Parker was to get,” and then asked if a verbal transfer would not be good. The counsel remarked that it would. Urie then turned round to Richard Parker and said, “ Richard, I transfer $500 of the David Miller bond to Thomas D. Parker, and I wish you to pay that amount to him.”</p>

The law implies this consideration from the facts, and it is not necessary to prove that the parties particularly expressed it in the contract.

On the other hand, if the promisee, relying on the promise, make no other provision, by will or otherwise, for the objects of his bounty, but die intestate, thus leaving his estate to fall into the hands of the heir, to an amount greater than the specified donations, the heir is bound, in conscience and in law, to fulfil the contract.
