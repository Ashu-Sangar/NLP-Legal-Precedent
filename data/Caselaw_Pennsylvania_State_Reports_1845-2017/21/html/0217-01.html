The order directs the viewers to vacate a road, and lay out another in lieu thereof between different points, and in an entirely different direction; thus giving to one set of viewers the powers that can only be exercised by two juries. 3. A straight road is vacated — part of old Newport road laid out sixty years ago; and a change in. the same will be productive of great inconvenience to the public.</p>
