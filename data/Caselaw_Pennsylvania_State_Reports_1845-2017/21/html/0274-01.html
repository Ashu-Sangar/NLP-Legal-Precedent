It is not necessary for us to say anything about the irregularity of the survey given in evidence, because, if it were regular, it would not avail the owner against May’s improvement. There being no survey returned in 1821, May had as good a right to consider it vacant land as if there never had been a location for it.</p>

It is urged that the deed is conclusive evidence against him to show that the title was out of the Commonwealth. We cannot instruct you that this is law. If May, in 1833, was living on vacant land, and claiming it by improvement, and Reily’s executors set up a pretended title to part of his claim, and he bought out that pretended title, and took a deed for it, he is not estopped in this action from proving the truth as regards his improvement.
