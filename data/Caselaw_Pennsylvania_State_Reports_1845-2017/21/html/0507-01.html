And, in our apprehension, there was no difficulty in the question. Reaney, FTeafie &amp; Co. bound themselves to construct an engine of specified dimensions and character, and “ to find one man to put up said engine, and to stay with it two weeks after completion.” Culbertson, Griffey and Gudykunst, the parties of the first part, agreed, among other things, “ to furnish all such help as may be required by our man <em>for the putting of said engine and boilers in operation." </em>We suppose that these provisions interpret each other; that the putting up said engine, and putting said engine and boilers in operation, are equivalent expressions, and that neither of them include the construction of the foundations any more than the building which was to contain the engine. And that this was the understanding of the parties is shown by the draft which was furnished, and by the fact that the foundation of the boilers was commenced by the parties of the first part, before Mr. Kirk, the agent of the parties of the second part, had arrived.</p>

Erom the tenor of the contract, and from the conduct of the parties, we entertain no doubt that the erection of the foundation and side walls — all that was properly masonry — belonged to the defendants to do, and if defectively done it was their misfortune, which, under the. agreement, they have no right to charge against the plaintiffs.</p>
