    <p class="summary" id="b280-10" data-blocks='[["BL_280.8",280,[263,1058,1164,214]]]'>This was an appeal from the decree of the Orphans’ Court of said county, in the matter of the auditor’s report on the account of Daniel W. Kistler, one of the executors of the will of George Adam Hower, deceased. The appeal was taken by Jacob Hock, one of the legatees under the will.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b280-11" data-blocks='[["BL_280.9",280,[262,1272,1157,85]]]'>The will of the testator is dated the 26th day of July, 1849. The testator died in the early part of August, 1849.</p>

In his account he claimed a credit for $507.50, paid by him on the 25th of August, 1849, to Adam German. The debt was contracted as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b280-13" data-blocks='[["BL_280.11",280,[257,1525,1164,429]]]'>In the spring of 1841, Daniel W. Kistler borrowed $500 from the said Adam German, for which he gave his own bond. This sum of $507.50 was paid by Daniel W. Kistler to the said Adam German, after the death of the testator, in discharge of said bond. On the part of the accountant it was alleged that he borrowed this money from German <em>for </em>Hower, the testator, and that he gave him the money in the spring of 1841, on the same day he got it from German; and that having paid the bond to German since Hower’s death, he had a right to charge Hower’s estate with the amount so paid, and to take credit for it in his account.</p>

It was alleged that the money was borrowed by Kistler alone, and for which he gave his own bond. That he had not shown any obligation on the part <em>of Hower </em>to Kistler or German, for this money; nor any acknowledgment of this debt on the part of Hower or promise to pay it. That so far from Hower owing this debt to Kistler, Kistler was indebted to <em>Hower </em>by four different obligations, given by Kistler to Hower at different times <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>shortly before Hower’s death, and which notes remained due and unpaid at the time of his death. It was contended that Hower never was bound for this money, and that if he was, it had been long since paid; that the statute of limitations was a complete bar to any claim against Hower or his estate by Kistler.</p>

An executor or administrator cannot, by his acknowledgment, take a case out of the operation of the statute of limitations, and notwithstanding such acknowledgment, the statute may be pleaded: <a href="/nc/47/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Jones 66" data-case-ids="8681263" data-case-paths="/nc/47/0066-01">2 <em>Jones </em>66</a>, <em>Steele v. </em>Steele.

A legatee, or other person interested in an estate, may interfere and take advantage of the statute of limitations against a debt claimed from the estate, although the executor should refuse to plead the statute: 2 <em>Williams on Executors </em>1282. It was contended that a legatee or heir may plead the statute in defence of a claim made by the executor against the estate. The executor cannot take for himself at pleasure. He must prove his debt. He must prove it as any other claimant would be held to prove his debt. If this be so, the decree of the Court in this case was erroneous.</p>

It was said that the relation of Hower and Kistler to each other was such (Kistler being his clerk, and made a trustee to pay Herman) that the statute did not operate: 2 <em>Balias </em>264. As between Herman and Hower, the administrator was not <em>bound </em>to interpose the statute. It was said that an executor or administrator is not bound to plead the statute, though it was admitted that a legatee, or heir, may interpose and plead it <em>before the debt is paid.</em>

There was no privity of contract between Hower and German.
