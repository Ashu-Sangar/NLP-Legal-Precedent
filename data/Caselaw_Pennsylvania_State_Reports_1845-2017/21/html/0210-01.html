H.

Here there was no sale, in pursuance of the inquisition, but the sale was made in pursuance of a <em>fi. fa. </em>issued by the plaintiff; when defendant waived the right of having an inquest, and before the sale claimed the $300 allowed by the Act of 1849. In a proceeding of this kind, there is no time indicated by the Act of Assembly when the claim must be made; and as this is a law intended to benefit poor insolvent debtors, as favorable a construction ought to be given in their favor as the words and spirit of the law will permit <em>; </em>and as the Act of Assembly, when personal property is sold upon a <em>fi. fa., </em>only seems to require that the claim for the $300 worth of property should be made some time before the sale, and as this was done here, we see nothing to cause a forfeiture of that privilege, unless the proceedings had under the execution of Ery &amp; Co. is to bar the defendant.

The sale cannot be proceeded in before a term intervenes after the appraisement, so as' to give the parties interested an opportunity to set it aside, if there be cause. The 4th .section provides that <em>upon ike return </em>of the'writ with the appraisement, the plaintiff may have <em>another </em>writ for the sale of the residue, if the appraisers have determined on a division, and if not, he may have <em>another </em>writ for the sale of the whole. If, therefore, the defendant’s claim for an appraisement be first set up at a time when the writ is out on which a sale could be made, the allowance of the claim must necessarily have the effect of postponing the sale for a term. This can never be tolerated, unless the debtor can show that he made his request as soon as he could after he knew of the levy.</p>
    <p id="b213-9" data-blocks='[["BL_213.7",213,[212,1582,1165,392]]]'>The act of 1849 was not made to hinder or delay the recovery of just claims. It was meant only for the benevolent purpose of enabling an insolvent debtor to keep a shelter and the means of living for himself and his family. This he cannot have unless he demands it; for the law gives it to him on that condition. It is as easy to make this demand early as late. That is not a harsh construction which requires him to claim the advantages of a statute like this at a time and in a manner which will do the least possible injury to his honest creditors.</p>
    <p id="b213-10" data-blocks='[["BL_213.8",213,[211,1974,1177,417]]]'>In the case before us the defendant waived inquisition, and agreed that the sheriff might proceed with the sale under the <em>sewv^ facias. </em>On the day fixed for the sale a request was made for appraisers, who were appointed, and found that the property could not be divided. The sale then went on as if no appraisement had been made. The regularity of the sale was only saved by the irregularity of the appraisement, since, if the latter had not been wholly out of time and void, the sheriff was bound to return it and wait for another writ before he could sell. But one error neutralized the other.</p>

Every consideration of justice and policy which induced this Court to determine that the benefit of the statute must be claimed before inquisition, requires us to hold that all advantages under it are gone, after a waiver. When the defendant in an execution consents to a condemnation, and agrees to an immediate sale on a <em>fi. fa., </em>and when the plaintiff, taking him at his word, proceeds in the proper steps to make his money, it would violate the principle which pervades all the cases on the subject, to let the proceeding be stopped on the eve of consummation by such a demand as was made here.</p>

The defendant agreed with one of his creditors, that he would not claim the benefit of the three hundred dollar law against him. To the creditor who held that agreement; the full amount of his debt was awarded, though there were other liens prior to his. What is worse still, the defendant assigned his claim under the act to a person who had no judgment at all; and this assignee was preferred to judgment-creditors for whose payment the land was pledged by law.</p>

The debtor in this case seems to have thought that the law was made, not to protect his family from want, but to give him the power of preferring those whom he chose to favor, at the expense of others whom he liked less, but whose legal rights were superior. He used it to subvert the maxims of the law, by giving to the sleepy what none but the vigilant were entitled to.</p>

He must make his claim, if he makes it at all, in good faith to carry out the very purpose of the law, and no other. All transfers and all waivers of his right, whether express or implied, enure to the benefit of his creditors in the proper order of their liens. Whatever he does not claim for himself or his family, he leaves in the general fund under the control of the Court, to be distributed among those who are legally entitled to it; and such distribution is not to be regulated by any wish of his, no matter in what form he may choose to express it.</p>
