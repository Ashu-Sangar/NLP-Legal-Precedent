Certain portions of real estate were designated for different sons, at certain valuations ; equalization was provided for, &amp;c., and it was directed that if either John or Jacob, or both, refused to take the land devised to them, then the executors to sell the same and purchase real estate equal to John and Jacob’s respective fifth share, take the title to the executors in trust for each (John and Jacob) for life, and remainder to their respective children in fee, as tenants in common, giving the executors large discretion, and appointing them trustees for the purpose above stated.</p>

This account shows a balance, nominally, against accountants of $14,333.63, one-fifth of which is $2866.72 3-5. To this account some of the children of John Ake excepted; an auditor was appointed, who reported, changing the account, <em>inter alia, </em>by charging $5055.20, interest up to the Sling of account; making the balance, by this report, $19,626.83, one-fifth of which is $3925.36 3-5.

    <p class="summary" id="b321-6" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[188,818,1167,119]]]'>The opinion of the Court was as follows: “ A careful examination of this report has revealed to us ño error committed by the auditor.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b321-7" data-blocks='[["BL_321.5",321,[179,948,1176,945]]]'>“ The principal complaint is, that the accountants have been charged with interest (which appears to have been charged in accordance with established rules) on certain sums of money in their hands, because it is alleged <em>John </em>Ake’s children are the only parties interested, and because their father was permitted to -occupy, without rent, and for several years, a portion of the real estate of the testator. This reason is, at best, no better than this, that the accountants are entitled.themselves to the use of the funds in their hands, and not chargeable with interest on it, because John Ake’s children are not entitled to a proportion of the interest. But the accountants were not themselves entitled to the use of funds lying in their hands. Interest is chargeable against them on part of the estate, in exhibiting the whole estate, which is the office of an executor’s or an administrator’s account. Who is entitled to it, is another and an after question, and one which arises in the distribution. If John Ake’s children have no right to any part of the additional sum charged as interest, and the accountants hold releases which are sufficient to relieve them from the duty of payment to any others, they will not be harmed by being compelled to make a full and legal exhibition of the whole estate of the testator. But there are points which, as they do not here arise, but relate to an after question, must be left open to future inquiry.</p>

It is the duty of an executor or administrator to set forth the true condition of the trust, without any reference to its ultimate destination. How creditors, legatees, or next of kin may be affected by it, is not a consideration which ought to alter its shape. Its object is to ascertain how much the accountants have received, and how much remains after payment of debts and expenses. Payments made to, or releases given by distributees, can have no place in it. It settles nothing but the basis on which a distribution may be made hereafter. Interest is properly chargeable against the accountants, according to the general rule in such cases; but the legatees will nevertheless not get it unless they are entitled to it.</p>
