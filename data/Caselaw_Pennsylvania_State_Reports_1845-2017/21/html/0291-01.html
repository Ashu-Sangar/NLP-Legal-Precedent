As- regards the question of interest, the Court are of opinion that the neglect of the defendant to deposit the money ‘ <em>in bank as fast as </em>received’ is conclusive evidence that he had used it himself, and is therefore liable to pay interest from the 8th of November, 1845, when the case stated finds that he had collected the whole amount of proceeds of sale.
