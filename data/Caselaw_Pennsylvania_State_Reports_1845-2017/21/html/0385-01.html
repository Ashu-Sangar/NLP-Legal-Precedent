The accountant made a return to the auditor-general, on the 10th December, 1835, of the taxes collected by him as treasurer of Northampton county, but no settlement of his account was made by the accounting officers till the' 1st May, 1846, when an account was settled against him, showing a balance in his hands in 1835, according to his return, of $2396.43. To this sum the accounting officers added ten years’ interest, amounting to $1437.85, making the aggregate $3834.28 due the Commonwealth on May 1, 1846. From this settlement this appeal was taken, and the question for decision by the Supreme Court was whether the Commonwealth was entitled to recover interest on the money in the hands of the defendant, before the settlement of his account on the 1st May, 1846.</p>
