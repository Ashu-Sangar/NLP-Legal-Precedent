No man is presumed to contract against <em>bare possibilities, </em>without express words. Besides, for such injuries the tenant has his redress by claiming damages, which it is to be presumed the public will accord and pay. If, then the state had entered <em>for the first time, </em>and drawn off the water after the lease was executed, we should hold that it did not come within the covenant for quiet enjoyment, although the same is expressed in strong and broad terms.

Why covenant against the interruption or molestation of any one, if the landlord and tenant had not feared this contest with the state agents ? The warranty of title has always been held to be a distinct covenant from that for quiet enjoyment, and is applicable to the latter expressions of the covenant, ‘so that the said lessee shall suffer no loss from any defect of title of the lessors to the premises.’ Those are the only words which in my mind raise any doubt as to the intention of the parties; but it is an axiom of the law that a subsequent limited covenant does not restrain a preceding general one; <em>Sugden on </em>Vendors, vol. 2, p. 113; and every man’s covenant is to be construed most strongly against himself, if his words are doubtful.

We have already said that the knowledge of Shippen, of the right and power of the state to interrupt him in the use of the water, did not deprive him of the benefit of his covenant for its quiet enjoyment, but was probably the cause of his taking the contract in the form he did; and the plaintiffs accepting an assignment of his lease, cannot be prevented from setting up this defence. Both they and their assignor had a right to rely on the covenants, and the landlord must take care to enter into no contract that he cannot make good. If Shippen had accepted the lease without the covenant for quiet enjoyment, the principle of <em>caveat emptor </em>would have applied to him; but when he calls on his landlord for protection in his term, the latter must take care as to the covenants he makes.” To this charge the defendants’ counsel excepted.</p>

But such is not the fact. The works of the Commonwealth, for the purpose of drawing off the water to be used in feeding the canal, were erected as early as 1834, and from that time up to the date of the lease the canal commissioners and their subordinate officers claimed, and to some extent exercised the right of using the water when necessary for the public works.
