And they all do participate, unless Ellen Culbertson, the plaintiff, and daughter of testator’s deceased daughter, Catherine, is excluded. The testator makes his grandchildren his residuary legatees, and describes them as the children of his daughters, without designating any of the grandchildren by name.” He quoted the 12th item, and proceeded as follows:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b312-6" data-blocks='[["BL_312.4",312,[282,678,1159,257]]]'>“ Mrs. Culbertson had two children: a son named Thomas Urie, and a daughter named Ellen, and the question presented is, whether the bequest by testator to <em>the child </em>of his deceased daughter, Catherine Culbertson, includes the son and excludes the daughter, or whether both were intended by their grandfather as objects of his bounty.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="Ai78" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[279,936,1161,255]]]'>“ A bequest to <em>the </em>child of a deceased daughter, when there were two children, would be not only ambiguous and uncertain, but unintelligible and void for uncertainty. It, therefore, becomes necessary to' resort to the rules of construction applicable to cases of this kind, and by a reference to adjudicated cases the question presented is easily solved.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b312-8" data-blocks='[["BL_312.6",312,[275,1191,1162,555]]]'>“ In 2 <em>Jarman on Wills, </em>108, the rule is thus stated: <em>‘ </em>It often happens that a gift to children describes them as consisting of a specified number, which is less than the number found to exist at the date of the will. In such cases it is highly probable that the testator has mistaken the actual number of the children, and that his real intention is that all the children, whatever may be their number, shall be included. Such, accordingly, is the established construction, the numerical restriction being wholly disregarded.’ Thus in Tompkins <em>v. </em>Tompkins, 2 <em>Vesey, Sr. </em>564, where a testator, after bequeathing twenty pounds to his sister, gave to her <em>three </em>children fifty pounds each, and the legatee had <em>four, </em>Lord Hardwicke held that they were all entitled.

The 8th item is as follows: ‘ I bequeath to Thomas Urie Culbertson, the son of my deceased daughter Catherine, the sum of $500, in addition to his share of the residue of my estate as hereinafter given.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b313-6" data-blocks='[["BL_313.4",313,[181,690,1165,215]]]'>“ The argument is, that as Thomas, the son, is here designated as a residuary legatee, and as the term child in the 12th item ■ is singular, and cannot include Thomas and his sister Ellen, it must necessarily mean Thomas, who had been named in a preceding item as an intended residuary legatee.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b313-7" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[182,905,1163,86]]]'>“ I cannot concur in the views of defendants’ counsel, in assigning the office of elucidating the 12th item to the 8th.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b313-8" data-blocks='[["BL_313.6",313,[179,991,1167,343]]]'>“ I think the testator intended nothing more by the 8th item than to give his namesake, Thomas Urie Culbertson, five hundred dollars more than the other residuary legatees, and he has declared this intention in plain and concise language. But Thomas still remains a residuary legatee, although his sister Ellen is included in the residuary clause; so that this construction fully meets the intention expressed in the 8th item of making Thomas a residuary legatee.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b313-9" data-blocks='[["BL_313.7",313,[181,1333,1165,771]]]'>“ But does not the 8th item fortify plaintiff’s claim as a residuary legatee ? It shows testator knew his daughter Catherine had a son named Thomas Urie Culbertson, and in that item he is named in full. But in the 12th item the residuary legacy is given to the <em>child </em>of his deceased daughter Catherine. If he knew his daughter Catherine had also a daughter, it is very improbable that testator would designate the son to the exclusion of the daughter by the word child, which is equally applicable to either, and particularly when in the next item (the Í3th) he again designates his grandson by name, in giving to him a gold watch, &amp;e. Had testator intended that Thomas alone, to the exclusion of his sister, should participate in thb residuum of his estate, he would have designated him by name, as he did in the preceding and subsequent items, and not used the ambiguous term child, which is as applicable to a daughter as a son. He would have called him his grandson, Thomas Urie Culbertson (for it appears the old gentleman loved to designate his namesake by his name in full), or the son of his deceased daughter Catherine.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b314-6" data-blocks='[["BL_314.4",314,[304,555,1161,261]]]'>“ This hypothesis is strengthened by the latter clause of the 12th item, in which he directs the mode in which the children of his daughter, Eleanor Law, are to be equalized, in the language of testator, ‘ with the bequests with my <em>other </em>grandchildren,’ showing evidently that testator supposed he had provided for all his grandchildren.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b314-7" data-blocks='[["BL_314.5",314,[296,817,1165,767]]]'>“ Again, (and we must look at the whole will in giving a construction to any part of it,) in the 9th item, the benevolence of old Mr. Urie, and his kind regard for his relations is evinced by giving a legacy of two hundred and fifty dollars to his sister, Catherine Jacobs, not because she needed it, but in the language of testator, ‘ as a token of my affectionate remembrance.’ This, it is true, would be entitled to no consideration in a case where the language of the will was plain and unambiguous; but in the present case it has upon my mind a tendency to show that the testator would not pass by his granddaughter, Eleanor Culbertson, when all his other grandchildren were liberally provided for, without some token of his affectionate remembrance. If her existence was obliterated from his remembrance at the time he made his will, by the imbecility of extreme old age or other causes, then the law kindly relieves against the omissions occasioned by the defects of recollection, and under the term child, as used in this will, places the plaintiff in the same position of testator’s other grandchildren as one of the legatees under his will.</p>
