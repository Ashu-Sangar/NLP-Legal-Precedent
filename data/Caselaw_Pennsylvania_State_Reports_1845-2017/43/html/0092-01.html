What has been the effect of the whole of the third clause recited, when taken together <em>1 </em>Did it have the effect of cutting down the fee simple to a fee tail ? Or did it leave the first estate a conditional fee simple, determinable upon a definite failure of issue at the death of the devisee, and thus make the limitation over to the brothers an executory devise ? In the first instance, the property was, under this third clause, to ‘re-vest and descend to John, Daniel, and Samuel, or to their heirs,’ in the event that Stephen ‘ should die without issue or children,’ ‘provided Stephen should not make sale’ of it. The concluding part of the third clause, consisting of the provision for any surviving widow of Stephen at his death, causes the main difficulty in the construction of the limitation over. Is this provision to be taken as controlling the whole clause, and the rights of the three brothers of the devisee in case of his death without issue ? It is contended that the language used clearly indicated an intention that the limitation should take effect on the death of Stephen; that it contemplated a definite failure of issue; and that the devise, therefore, was executory.</p>

In the last ease it was said that <em>“ </em>to effectuate the clear intention of testators, the words <em>heir, issue, </em>and <em>children </em>are construed interchangeable. The exception to the general rule is stated in Eichelberger <em>v. </em>Barnitz to be “ when the time at which the devise over is to take effect, is expressly or impliedly limited to a particular period, within a life or lives in being, and twenty-one years after.” Thus, in the case of Langley <em>v. </em>Heald, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0096-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 96" data-case-ids="481819" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0096-01">7 W. &amp; S. 96</a>, the devise was to the testator’s son, Passmore Heald, his heirs and assigns, but reserving the rents and profits to the use of his daughter Elizabeth until the son should arrive at the age of twenty-one. In case the son should die and leave no lawful issue, the land was then devised to the daughter if she should then be living, and to her heirs and assigns for ever ; and if she should die and leave no lawful issue, then over. It was held that the first devise was of a fee, subject to be defeated by the death of Passmore without issue during the lifetime of Elizabeth; and that event not having occurred, his estate became absolute. So in the case of the will now under examination. Giving effect to all the clauses having a bearing on the question before the court, it would amount to a devise to Stephen Barnet and his heirs and assigns, but with a direction that, in the event of his death without children, one half of his property should go to his wife, if, <em>at that time, </em>his wife should survive, and the other half should go to his brothers. Then upon the death of the wife, her half was to go to the brothers also. But if, at the time of the first devisee’s death, no wife <em>then </em>surviving him, he should leave no children, the brothers were to take the whole estate. The provision made for the widow would seem conclusively to establish the intention of the testator to fix the point of time when the limitations over should take effect, at the death of Stephen Barnet, the first devisee.</p>

If it had not contained this authority to sell, the limitations would have been an executory devise, and upon the death of Stephen without children, his brothers would clearly have been entitled to the land. It may be, though this point is not considered, that if no attempt to exercise the authority had been made, and the estate stood at Stephen’s death as it stood at the time of his succession under the will, the provision would have been unimportant. But Stephen in his lifetime actually conveyed the land. He did not, in the terms of the will, <em>‘ </em>sell it)’ for the fact is, the deed <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>was a formal one only, made for the purpose of unfettering the land from the limitations which the will imposed.

But no reason is apparent why the rules adopted by the courts in proceedings under that act should not apply to a case situated like the present one. Authority was given to tenants in tail ‘to grant, bargain, sell, and convey lands.’ This authority was held to warrant and sustain titles derived through conveyances the only consideration for which was the barring of the entail. Thus in Rancel <em>v. </em>Oresswell, 6 Casey 158, the tenant in tail made a deed for the purpose of barring the entail, and received the following day a reconveyance from his grantee. The estate was subsequently sold, and it was held that the entail 'was barred. In Pierce <em>v. </em>Hakes, 11 Harris 281, a deed had been made by the tenant and her husband in consideration of $1 as well as to bar the entail. The tenant died before the motion for the entry of the deed upon record was made in the court, and the Court of Common Pleas held that while, for that reason, it was inoperative for the purpose designed, yet the conveyance was valid to pass the estate of the husband as tenant by the curtesy. In entering the judgment in that case <em>non obstante </em>veredicto, Judge Conyngham said: ‘ The deed, though by the act of God it became inoperative, or rather was never fully operative as to the wife, would still be good to the extent of the husband’s title.’ In George <em>v. </em>Morgan, 4 Harris 95, there was a similar question. The deed had been made for the purpose of barring entail. It had not been recorded within six months as required by law, but it was still held to be good to convey the grantor’s right of possession.</p>

The authority conferred by the will stood in the place of a rule of law. The son made a deed, which was formal certainly, but which was an exercise of the power vested in him. Notwithstanding the immediate reconveyance, there was a period of time, however short, during which the title to the property was lodged in the grantee.
