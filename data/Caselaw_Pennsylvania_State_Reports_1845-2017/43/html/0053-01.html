On the 12th of January 1861, the recognisance was forfeited absolutely, and process awarded to arrest the defendant and bring him into court for sentence. He was arrested accordingly and brought to York, where he again entered into recognisance with his father as surety in f1000, for his appearance in court on the 4th day of February 1861. On that day he again failed to appear, and his recognisance, and that of his bail, was forfeited. The same day the court allowed an <em>exoneretur </em>to be entered on the recognisance of the bail, which had been forfeited on the 12th of January 1861, on the <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>ground that a new recognisance had been given. The recognisances forfeited on the 4th February 1861 were not sued out. On the 26th day of August 1861, the defendant came into the Quarter Sessions, and by his counsel moved the court to respite and cancel all the recognisances in the case previously entered into and forfeited, and particularly that entered into January 25th 1861, and forfeited February the 4th 1861. No grounds were alleged as the basis of this motion, but it was intimated that the defendant was ready to appear. The counsel for the Commonwealth refused either to consent to any order or decree of the court, or to accept notice on behalf of the prosecutrix; whereupon the court directed notice to be given to Mary Dalliousen personally. On the 80th of August 1861, the defendant’s motion was granted, and the court cancelled the recognisances accordingly. When the defendant stood at the bar of the court, ready to receive his sentence, and while the order cancelling the recognisances was being made and entered, and the president judge had commenced to pronounce the sentence of the law upon the conviction on record, a pardon wras produced, and pleaded in bar of the sentence, and the defendant moved for his discharge without day. This motion the court refused, and ordered the defendant to enter into recognisance for his appearance at November Sessions 1861. On the 7th of November the defendant came into court and renewed his motion to be discharged, and produced his pardon. The Commonwealth denied the validity of the pardon, because it was improperly obtained by false, deceptive, and fraudulent misrepresentations to the governor, and asked the court to direct an inquiry into the facts. The Commonwealth further averred that, admitting the validity of the pardon, it was not effective either to prevent the order of the court for the maintenance of the bastard child or to discharge the defendant from payment of the costs of prosecution. All these objections on the part of the Commonwealth were, however, overruled, and the judgment of the court (Fisher, P. J.) was entered January 6th 1862, under the following opinion :</p>

The governor by the constitution has the power to remit fines and forfeitures, and to grant reprieves and pardons. If in the exercise of that prerogative representations are made, or evidence is submitted to him upon which the applicant relies, he and he only is to decide what weight and credence ought to be given to them, and whether they are sufficient to induce him to exe.rcise his clemency. Doubtless much is written and said on such occasions which he disregards; but having decided to exercise the pardoning power, he places his reasons on the face of the grant, and I know' of no tribunal that hp.s/the right to inquire into them. And here I might remark that much of the reasoning adopted by the Supreme Court in the case of Cooper <em>v. </em>Erie Railroad, cited by the counsel for the appellant, is applicable to this case. Should courts undertake to rehear the matter, and to decide that a pardon was void because the governor was imposed upon in matters not appearing on the pardon, the power to grant them would virtually be usurped by a tribunal in which the constitution had not vested it. It would in fact be an allowance by the courts of an appeal from tlx© acts of the executive. If when pleaded its validity can be inquired into, as if it was a private deed or grant, I can see no reason why when offered in evidence to qualify a convict witness it is not equally open to inquiry.' Such a practice would lead to insufferable delay and confusion in the proceedings of courts. I have examined all the sources of information, British and American, within my reach, and I have not been able to find any case allowing parol evidence to be given, nor indeed any in which it was offered to make proof of the kind here desired; and in the only American one, State <em>v. </em>McIntyre, 1 Jones’ Law Rep. (N. 0.), the judge who delivered the opinion of the court said: ‘We can <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>look only at the record of which a copy of the pardon is a part, and can take notice of nothing <em>aliunde.’</em>

This objection leads to the inquiry what power the courts have to declare a pardon void because it exhibits internal evidence that it was obtained by a suppression of the truth, or the suggestion of a falsehood.</p>

Lord Coke seems so to understand it, for he continues : ‘ A man commits felony, and is attainted thereof, or is abjured for the same, the king pardoneth him the felony, without any mention of the attainder or abjuration, the pardon is void. But if a man be attainted of burglary, and by the pardon all felonies, &amp;c., are pardoned (except burglaries), the attainder and burglary be excepted.’</p>

The pardon was declared void, first, because, according to the statute of North Carolina, an appeal having been taken to the Supreme Court, there was no subsisting judgment, as the pardon represented. Secondly, because the pardon releases the imprisonment upon condition that the fine and costs be paid, when in fact there was no fine imposed. Thirdly, because the condition precedent upon which the pardon was to take effect could not be performed; and fourthly, because the pardon and record taken together showed that the governor was imposed upon and deceived. But if, in the case under consideration, the governor was mistaken, that could not avoid the pardon unless the grantee had caused the misapprehension, which does not appear. That it must appear, we think the authorities establish. ‘ If the king be not deceived by any matter suggested by the grantee, but is only mistaken in his affirmation or surmises, although it be in the law itself, such grants are good, and such construction of them should be made as tends to their support:’ Viner Abr. vol. 17, p. 100.</p>

But we are inclined to think that the judgment was affirmed upon the ground taken by the counsel for the Commonwealth in the argument: that the mere filing of the pardon does not make it a part of the record, and that to entitle the party to its benefit, it must be pleaded. In view, therefore, of the authorities cited, we hold that the pardon in question discharged the defendant from any liability to pay costs.</p>

At the instant of the birth of the child ? When the information is made ? When the bill is found, or when the verdict is rendered ? I apprehend at neither of these times, but only when the sentence is passed; and if no sentence can be passed because tha conviction is set aside, there is no basis to support such a decree. And this view seems to be in accordance with the rulings of our own Supreme Court. In Booz <em>v. </em>Engarman, 6 Harris 264, it is said, <em>‘ </em>after sentence is pronounced, should the court in the order of maintenance direct a sum of money to be paid to the prosecutrix by the party accused, her right to the money becomes vested by the adjudication, and an escape afterwards is undoubtedly a good foundation for an action in her name. But until such order be made in her favour, she has no cause of action against the accused, or no legal interest in or control over the warrant issued for his arrest. The criminal proceeding is not in her name, or for her benefit, but in the name of the Commonwealth, for the purpose of enforcing the moral duty of maintenance, and for the protection of the public from the expense.’</p>

It seems, therefore, that the right to receive the maintenance can only be a consequence of the sentence. And here we are led to inquire what <em>effect </em>the executive intended the pardon to have, or, in other words, what did he pardon ? The instrument itself recites that <em>‘ </em>a certain David Ahl was convicted upon a certain indictment charging him with fornication and bastardy,’ and after giving the reasons for the grant, it concludes, (that in consideration of the premises, I have, by virtue of my official prerogative and authority, pardoned the said David Ahl, and he is accordingly fully pardoned of the said <em>conviction </em>and <em>offence.’ </em>In using these words, the governor evidently intended that the pardon should set aside and annul the verdict, and arrest the judgment. I cannot perceive how any vested right, order, or decree can be founded upon, or flow from a conviction thus circumstanced. But the case of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Duncan is cited as <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>in point; there the adultery only was pardoned, and the bastardy specially excluded.
