By the plain terms of the 24th section of the Act of February 24th 1834, these debts ceased to be a lien on the real estate of the decedent at the expiration of five years from his death, unless secured by judgment or mortgage, or the claim, had been filed in the prothonotary’s office under certain circumstances, which it is not pretended was the case here. The payment of the debts by the administrator could not prolong the lien an hour, as is clearly settled by numerous cases; see <a href="/watts-serg/5/0397-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 397" data-case-ids="477989" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0397-01">5 W. &amp; S. 397</a>, 5 Casey 239, 5 Harris 126, Driesbach’s Appeal; and it matters not whether many years had expired beyond the time fixed by law, as in several of the reported cases, or only twelve days, as in the present, the lien of <em>the </em>debt is irretrievably lost. It has been urged that, until letters of administration were issued, the time would not begin to run; and if such is the <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>law, five years had not expired when this petition was presented. We are unable to see any analogy between this provision and the Statute of Limitations for the commencement of actions. If a debt is due before the debtor dies, the Statute of Limitations has begun to run, and the death and want of administration will not stop it. It runs over all obstacles — infamy, coverture, death, and all others. If the claim falls due after the debtor’s death, there is a suspension of the statute until a party is raised up against whom suit can be brought. It is otherwise as to liens under the Act of 1834. If the creditor wishes to save liis debt, by reaching- real estate, lie must raise up an administrator, and commence his action within the five years, and duly prosecute it to judgment; and should he commence suit but one day before the five years have expired, the lien is good against the land, provided it be duly prosecuted. Neither the time of taking out letters of administration, nor that of paying the debts, nor the settlement of the administration account, can avail this administrator. Ilis lien on the real estate as to a large portion of his debt is gone. Had the debts paid by Edward Demmy been in the favour of judgments or mortgages, in the lifetime of his intestate, we have no doubt that he would have been subrogated to the rights of the creditor, and his lien would have remained probably so long as that of the debt which he paid, certainly for six years after payment, as he might not be permitted to claim by subrogation after his right to support an action had ceased. That an executor or administrator will be substituted to the rights of the creditor, whose debt he paid, is clearly settled in this state, 5 Barr 105; and in England, 7 E. C. L. R. 67. The decease of the debtor is the period fixed by law from which the time of lien must be computed, not the granting of administration, the payment of the debts, or the settlement of the accounts.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b159-6" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[268,1737,1169,683]],["BL_160.1",160,[282,398,1170,1371]]]'>“ In regard to three of these debts embraced within the administration account, and amounting in the aggregate to $346.73, the law is otherwise. Suits were brought by Christian Rupp, and also by Stewart Wilson, against Leonard Demmy in his lifetime. After his death, the administrators were substituted, and the claims were duly prosecuted to judgment some time in the latter part of 1855 and the early part of 1856, and paid by the administrator. These were valid liens when the petition was presented, as the actions had been commenced within the time fixed by law, and were duly prosecuted. As to these three debts, the administrator stands in the room of the creditor, and can properly collect them from the real estate. There is another class of claims, which we think can be lawfully collected by the administrator — the expense of settling the estate. It appears from the written agreement of the counsel in this case that the sum of $419.73 was paid by the administrator on account of various ser<a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>vices performed for the benefit of the decedent’s estate after his death, and that those claims were all duly paid by the administrator, and brought into his account, which, by the confirmation, is conceded to be correct. Although valid charges, against the estate of the decedent, they are not debts due by him, and do not, in our opinion, come within the provisions of the 24th section of the Act of February 24th 1834, which wo construe to apply to no debts except those contracted by the decedent and existing at the time of his death. We think that neither the words nor the policy of the law will give it a broader construction. An executor or administrator may be necessarily delayed for many years in settling the final account; he may be delayed by litigation or other causes; may have the sanction of the court for that delay, and after the five years have expired, and the expenditure of the personal assets, be involved in large sums for counsel fees, personal attendance, and the fees of officers, &amp;c. It would appear both strange and highly improper to throw the whole loss on the executor or administrator, or to say that the creditors shall lose their debts, when there is an ample real estate to pay them. Such debts, we have no doubt, remain a lien on the real estate for five years after they were contracted, at the least; and when discharged by the administrator, for five years after payment. It is very possible that there is no statutory provision for the expiration of their lien, though I would rather be disposed to fix the limitation of five years from the time they were contracted, by analogy to the statutory provision in relation to those existing at the time of the decedent’s death. In either case they remain liens against this land, and therefore the administrator is entitled to recover out of his whole claim the sum df $766.66, with interest thereon, say for four years, down to the 1st day of April next, when another portion of an order will go’ into effect, making in all the sum of $950.76 at that time.</p>

It was not ordered ‘ that not less than one-fourth of the purchase-money should be paid at the time of confirming the sale.’ Two answers present themselves to this objection: 1st. The order was prepared by the purchaser himself in his application, and therefore he ought not to complain of the irregularity; and 2d. It does not appear that one-fourth of the purchase-money Avould not be paid before the confirmation. At least one-half was required to be paid by the 1st of April next following the sale, and <em>non constat </em>that the same would be confirmed before that time. If a decree of confirmation would not cure this irregularity, and render the title valid, we should be obliged to declare the sale void from the <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>beginning; but we have no doubt that the defect, if any, would be cured by the decree. We consider the act <em>merely directory, </em>and if substantially followed the title will be good. It is better to make the order in the words of the statute, but when we have it in our power to conform to the directions, by delaying the decree, the objection is without weight. It possesses no equity <em>in </em>the present ease, as the purchaser presented the terms, knew the conditions of the sale, and agreed in writing to conform to them, and never urged any objection until the mill was destroyed. It is a well-settled principle that the equitable owner of an estate must bear the loss, and is entitled to any benefit which may accrue to the property' between the time of the agreement for purchase and the execution of the conveyance: 1 Sugden'on Vend. 887. Therefore where a house was burned down between the time of the agreement and the execution of the conveyance, it was held that the purchaser must bear the <em>loss, </em>although there ivas a delay in making the deed, owing to a defect of the title : Paine <em>v. </em>Miller, 6 Vesey 349. Such also is the rule of the civil law and of the law of Scotland: Sugden 339, and note. Such appears to be the settled law of England in ordinary sales, but a distinction seems to be taken in the courts between those and sales before a master, under a decree in chancery, where it is held that after a sale and confirmation <em>nisi, </em>if a loss occurs it must fall on the vendor: Ex parte Minor, 11 Vesey 559. Also in Twigg <em>v. </em>Fifield, 13 Vesey 517. The reason of the distinction is, that a purchase before a master entails no responsibility on the purchaser prior, to confirmation, and before that act he has no interest in the purchase, but the biddings are subject to be opened at any time.</p>

The judge, in delivering the opinion, puts the very case of a deterioration by fire, and says the purchaser would be obliged to receive a conveyance and bear the loss. It has long been settled that such sales are in every particular of a judicial character, and the buyer must take care as to the title, boundaries, and every other matter and thing which must be risked by a purchaser at sheriff’s sale. It is very true that the sale must be approved and confirmed by the court' before a deed can be executed, but approval is as much a matter of course as the acknowledgment of a sheriff’s deed, and if refused should be for the same reasons and on the same principles. The purchaser has an equally vested interest in his contract.

The purchaser at that time desired to have the sale confirmed. We decided on full consideration that a portion of the debt was a valid lien, and the sale unobjectionable. And although time was given to the guardian to pay a certain sum of money and relieve the property, yet there is nothing in the order affecting the validity of the sale ; but on the contrary, it stands as before, and is to be confirmed and a deed executed, unless the money is paid by a specified day, which was not done; for before that time the relative interest and wishes of the parties had changed from the reduction in value of the property by the fire. The postponement of the confirmation, and consequent delay in executing the deed, will not relieve the purchaser from his contract; for so long as the question is <em>sub judiee, </em>it must be considered the law’s delay.

We also think that no more of the sum credited to the administrator in his account remained a lien, than that for which judgment was obtained within five years, and the amount expended for services in the settlement of the estate. The Act. of February 24th 1884 is too plain to admit of any doubt. The limitation of the lien of the debts of a decedent is complete when five years have elapsed from his death, unless an action be commenced and prosecuted, or a copy of the demand be filed in the specified cases. The statutory period begins to run from the time of his death, not from the grant of letters-of administration on his estate. Nor can the fact that the administrator advanced his own funds and paid the debt within five years prolong the existence of the lien. The only <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>effect of liis payment was to entitle him in equity to a cession of the rights of the creditors paid. It could not enlarge those rights, and give him privileges which did not belong to those to whose position he succeeded. But there was still enough of indebtedness, which was a lien on the lands loft by the decedent, to justify the order to sell.</p>

The order to sell was granted on the 22d of August 1859, and was made returnable on the 6th of December in the same year. The sale was appointed for the 24tlf of September, when appellant became the highest bidder, and the property was returned as having been sold to him. Before the return the widow and heirs of the decedent obtained a rule to show cause why the order and all proceedings under it should not be set aside, and, on the 19th December 1859, they filed exceptions to the confirmation of the sale. On the 3d of February 1800, the court ordered the proceedings to be suspended, and held the case under advisement. On the 3d of March 1860, before the purchaser would have been entitled to the possession, and a deed, under the order of the- court and the conditions of sale, the mill on the premises was destroyed by fire, and thereby the property was largely depreciated in value. The widow and heirs then withdrew their objections to the confirmation of the sale, and asked the court to confirm it and direct the trustee to make a deed to the purchaser, and on the 18th of December 1860 (the court being of opinion that the loss occasioned by the fire must be borne by the purchaser), a decree of confirmation was entered.</p>

In ordinary sales by articles of agreement the purchaser is entitled to accretions, and must sustain any loss caused by accidental- injuries to the property between the time of the agreement for the purchase and the execution of the deed. This appears to be well settled. Equity regards that as done which has been agreed to be done, and which the parties to the agreement have in their power to do : <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>Richter <em>v. </em>Selin, 8 S. &amp; R. 440. Such a sale, therefore, works' a conversion, and if the vendor by articles die before conveyance, the purchase-money is substituted for the land, and passes to the personal representatives of the vendor, and not to his heirs. On the other hand, if the vendee die before conveyance, his personal representatives take nothing. The land descends to his heirs. For authorities collected upon this subject, references may be made to 2 Story’s Eq. Jur., p. 98, and notes. But the'reasons which apply to private executory contracts of sale, and which have led to the establishment of the principle that a vendee by articles is, in equity, the owner of the land which was the subject of the contract, and, as-such, must run the hazard of any deterioration in its value, that may take place before the conveyance of the perfect title, do not apply with equal force to Orphans’ Court sales for the payment of the debts of a decedent. Such sales are not absolute and unconditional. They depend for their validity upon the approval and confirmation of the court. They are liable to be vacated by a power superior to the purchaser and against his will. The sale, even after confirmation, does not divest the title of the heirs of the decedent, for it remains in the power of the court until a deed has been executed and delivered. Until then, their right to maintain ejectment, even against the purchaser, has not gone: Leshey <em>v. </em>Gardner, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0314-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 314" data-case-ids="1854675" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0314-01">3 W. &amp; S. 314</a>. Until then, no conversion takes place, and if the heir of the decedent die, even subsequently to the confirmation of the report of sale, but before the deed, his interest descends as land, and not as money: Erb <em>v. </em>Erb, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 147" data-case-ids="12169197" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0147-01">9 W. &amp; S. 147</a>; Biggert’s Appeal, 8 Harris 17. These cases recognise a clear distinction between sales made under order of an Orphans’ Court and private sales. The latter are exclusively acts of the parties, and are beyond the control of any other power. The former are not the acts of the decedent or his heirs or devisees. They are the acts of the court, and they require no consent of the owners. In substantial fact, the purchaser buys from the court through its agent. The court reserves the power to decline his bid, and to disannul the act of its agent, until the sale has been fully consummated. It is difficult to distinguish between such sales and those which are made by a master in chancery. In Ex parte Minor, 11 Vesey 559, Lord Eldon held that a purchase before a master is not complete before confirmation of his report, and therefore a loss by fire after a report of sale, but before confirmation, was held not to fall upon the purchaser. The same rule was adopted in Twigg <em>v. </em>Fifield, 13 Vesey 517, and was recognised in 1 Sugden V. &amp; P. 58, and in 3 D. &amp; <em>W. </em>74. It appears to be the undoubted doctrine of courts of equity: 2 Daniel’s Ch. Prac. 1455.</p>

It is not obvious, however, wherein the dissimilarity consists. Both require confirmation— one by the express words of the statute, and the other by the uniform practice of the court. That is but a difference in form. No difference is seen in the responsibility of the purchasers. It is as fixed in the one case as in the other. Each purchaser may move for confirmation. Such sales would seem to be much more alike than are Orphans’ Court sales and sheriffs’ sales in a court of law. The purchaser at a sheriff’s sale has been held to acquire an inceptive title, commencing at the time when the property was struck down to him, an interest that may be bound by the lien of a judgment: Bellas <em>v. </em>McCarty, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%2021" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="10 Watts 21">10 Watts 21</a>; Morrison <em>v. </em>Wurtz, <a href="/watts/7/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="7 Watts 437" data-case-ids="1846788" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0437-01">7 Watts 437</a>; Stephen’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20188" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 188">8 W. &amp; S. 188</a>. This, however, only in cases where the sheriff’s deed had been acknowledged and delivered. There the deed relates back to the bid and its acceptance by the sheriff. Even in a sheriff’s sale the title of the debtor is not divested,, nor can the purchaser maintain ejectment or grant a lease of the lands, until the deed has been acknowledged and delivered: Hall <em>v. </em>Benner, 1 Penna. Rep. 402. But there are essential differences between an Orphans’ Court sale and a sheriff’s sale. The one is made by the owner, through the agency of the officer of the law, the other is made by the court, without any agency, express or implied, of the owner. In the one case, the court has the property in charge, supervises the sale, and may direct that it be made on credit; in the other, the court reviews the sale only indirectly, in virtue of its control over its officer and process, and the sale must be for cash. In the one case,-therefore, equity might presume that the purchase-money was paid when the sheriff accepted the purchaser’s bid, in the other no such presumption can arise. There seems to be then but a very remote analogy, if any, between the rights of a purchaser under a sheriff’s sale, and those under a sale made in the Orphans’ Court for the payment of debts. •</p>

Yet to me the remarks of the judge seem to be outside of the case. It was a suit brought by the administrator against the purchaser for the purchase-money. The sale had been confirmed, and the purchaser had taken possession. Deterioration of the value of the land of course could not avail as a defence against the administrator, whether the purchaser had title before the confirmation of the sale or not.</p>

      <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>It is needless to pursue this subject. Granting that the appellant would have been considered as the owner of the property from the day when the property was struck off to him, if the sale had been confirmed, so that the loss would have been his had fire occurred, it by no means follows that the sale ought to have been confirmed. There are in this case but two parties interested. On the one side is the purchaser, and on the other are the widow and heirs. It was by the agency and at the instance of the widow and heirs that the confirmation of the sale was delayed until the fire occurred. The appellant was kept in a state of uncertainty. He was compelled to be prepared with the purchase-money without knowing whether he would obtain the property. If he had an insurable interest, it was impossible to tell its amount, and he could not give his own care and vigilance to the protection of the mill, because he was not entitled to the possession, and he was prevented from obtaining it at the time fixed in the order and in the conditions of sale. All this is due to the widow and heirs, who now ask that the sale be confirmed, after having resisted its confirmation till the fire took place. We think it would be most inequitable, at their instance, to force the purchaser to take the property now. In confirming or refusing to confirm the sale, the Orphans’ Court sits as a court of equity. The circumstances and the conduct of the parties in interest are proper to be considered in the exercise of the court’s discretion.</p>
