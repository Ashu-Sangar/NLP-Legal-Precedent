Auten, to recover the penalty imposed by the thirty-sixth section of the Act of June 16th 1836, for not serving the rules of reference as directed by the Compulsory Arbitration Law; and came into the Common Pleas by appeal.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b324-6" data-blocks='[["BL_324.4",324,[294,651,1163,1154]]]'>The case rvas this: — Robert E. Auten had brought an action against Charles Hottenstine, in the Common Plea.s of Montour county, to No. 71 September Term 1857. On the 15th of February 1858, Lawson &amp; Brown appeared on the record as attorneys for Hottenstine. October 28th 1858, plaintiff entered a rule to arbitrate under the Compulsory Arbitration Act of 16th June 1836, which was returned served upon the’wife of the defendant. On the 13th November 1858, he proceeded to choose arbitrators in the absence of Hottenstine, and served notice of the time and place of meeting of the arbitrators upon the wife of the defendant. The arbitrators met on the 27th November 1858, and made an award in favour of plaintiff, which award, on the 21st December 1858, was set aside by the court, on the ground that the notices for choosing arbitrators, and of the time and place of their meeting, had not been given by plaintiff to defendant as required by the 12th and 16th sections of the Act of Assembly of 16th June 1836, entitled the Compulsory Arbitration Act. Hottenstine then instituted this suit for the penalty of forfeiture prescribed by the act. The court, on the trial of the cause, instead of instructing the jury that the notices had not been served as required’by the act, and that the plaintiff was therefore entitled to recover, instructed the jury that if the defendant Hottenstine had obtained notice of the arbitration in some other way not prescribed by the act, Auten was relieved from the forfeiture. There was evidence in the case under exception, that Hottenstine knew beforehand of the time and place of choosing the arbitrators.</p>
