That the notes above mentioned were made and put in circulation by defendants without requiring the payment of the capital stock or any part thereof from the stockholders, so that there was no means of redeeming them, and that on demand, payment of the notes so held by plaintiff had been refused by the officers of the bank, by means whereof they were and still are worthless.</p>

This capital stock was divided into two thousand shares, of $50 each. The bank went into operation on the 17th December 1838, and continued to do business until January 1848, when it suspended. It was resuscitated on the 9th of April 1845, by the introduction of T. P. St. John as cashier, and finally failed 27th October 1849, without any means to pay its circulation. J. O. Biddle acted as president from its organization unti,l April 1841, when William L. Post was elected, who acted as president until its failure in 1849. I. S.

Delamater was introduced into that office, where he remained until the failure. The defendants were acting as directors most or all of the time of the bank’s existence.

Promissory notes were given by the members of that company, payable to and deposited with Allen &amp; Paxon, New York, one for $60,000 and the other for $15,000. And a formal credit therefor was entered by them in favour of the bank about the time of its organization. Shortly afterwards these stock notes were returned to the bank, and on the 1st November 1839 two new notes, as renewals, one for $48,344.68 and the other for $15,000, were drawn, payable to the hank, and signed by the members of the stock company, among whom were William L. Post and Daniel Searle, two of the defendants.

The transfer was then made, and stated the amount to be one thousand six hundred and thirty-six shares (equal to $81,800), and that no certificates had been issued therefor. The evidence showed that this amount had never been paid into the bank; that the notes representing it were held <em>pro forma </em>for a time, and were then cancelled by the directors, without payment.</p>

The capital stock was to be $100,000, divided into shares of $50 each, and to be managed and directed by thirteen directors. The stock was to be sold at public outcry by an auctioneer appointed by the commissioners, and the net surplus above the par value was to be paid by the commissioners to the state treasurer for the use of the Commonwealth, previous to the charter of the said bank being signed by the governor, to be credited to the said bank in part payment for the bonus required to be paid for the privileges granted by the act. The 4th section of the Act of' 21st March 1814 requires that the governor, upon compliance with its terms, by letters patent under his hand and seal of the state, to create and erect the subscribers into one body politic and corporate in deed and in law, by its appropriate name, style, and title, and then grants to such body corporate the proper corporate rights, powers, and privileges. It is clear, then, that a charter or letters patent from the governor was necessary to create the Bank of Susquehanna County a body corporate; and this not having been proved by the plaintiff, or in any manner attempted to be supplied, he necessarily failed in supporting his original declaration upon the counts in which he could not recover.</p>

Having failed in presenting a material part of his case, he then seeks to introduce an entirely new issue by offering a new count, grounded on the assumption that this alleged bank was never legally chartered, but was simply a pretended institution, and that the defendants acted as directors of the same, and put in circulation large amounts of their promissory notes or bills to be used as money. Supposing this to be true, those defendants would be liable to be sued on these notes; for if there was no corporation, they would be clearly personally responsible for such issues. But this is an entirely different responsibility, and a different cause of action from that arising from their illegal and unlawful conduct as the directors, officers, and agents of a legal corporation lawfully chartered 'under the laws of the state. The court therefore committed no error in refusing this amendment, and the other errors assigned become immaterial upon the view we have taken of the case.</p>
