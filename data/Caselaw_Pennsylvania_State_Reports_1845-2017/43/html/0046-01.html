The defence alleged great mental imbecility in the testatrix, coupled with undue influence and actual duress, exercised upon her by the plaintiff, thereby creating an unfounded prejudice against the defendant, and resulting in the execution of this will. In support of these allegations a number of witnesses were called, who testified to their acquaintance during various periods of time with the testatrix : that she was of weak mind, short memory, and, assigning various reasons for their judgment, that she was unfit to make a will. In addition to this, the defendant offered to prove the condition of the testatrix, her acts and declarations, as well as the conduct of the plaintiff at times subsequent to the execution of the will, in order to establish the allegation of undue influence and actual constraint practised by the plaintiff upon the testatrix.

J.), after stating the main facts of the case, charged as follows : — “ It is as a general proposition true, that more reliance should be placed on the statements of subscribing witnesses than others who are not subscribing witnesses, nor were present at the signing of the will. It is also true, that the presumption is in favour of the sanity or capacity of a testator. But notwithstanding these general observations, it is the province of the jury to canvass all the testimony in the <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>case, so as to decide the issue according to the whole evidence. If they decide here that Louisa Youngheim was not of sound and disposing mind, memory, and understanding, at the time she signed this paper, they will determine the issue by finding for the defendant. But should the jury find that she was capable of making her will, they will next inquire as to the strength of her understanding, whether she was so enfeebled by age as to be easily prevailed upon to make a different disposition of her property, from what she would of her own accord have done. This point you will also determine according to all the evidence. If you should come to that conclusion, [you will then consider whether she was in fact unduly influenced by John Eckert, the plaintiff (for that is asserted), to make the will in question, by which her daughter is deprived of any participation in her estate, and the same was left to her more remote descendants. Should it be your opinion that from his intercourse with her exercising a stronger judgment and will over her enfeebled mind, he improperly induced her to cut off her child from the benefit of her worldly goods and property — in short, to make the devise as he directed, not according to her independent will and wishes, you would be justified in finding for the defendant,] in effect, that this is not the will of Louisa Youngheim.</p>

Still the question recurs, should you be of opinion that Louisa Youngheim had capacity sufficient for that purpose, whether her mind was or was not so weak, in consequence of her great age, or other circumstances in evidence, as to be easily misled and unduly influenced, and whether she was or was not influenced by the plaintiff. According as you find on these points, should be the verdict on the issue you are trying.]</p>

In most instances the mind and memory give way with the decline of the body. There are some exceptions, but where there is sufficient memory and understanding left to comprehend the property, that is, the items of which it consists, and also the persons to whom the testator designs to give it, there is in such a case a sound and disposing mind, memory, and understanding.</p>

This distinction in favour of the subscribing witnesses, is founded upon the duty which the law requires of them to be careful and observe that the testator is of sound mind, hefore they put their names as witnesses to the instrument; for on being called upon to prove the instrument, they, in order to prove it, must swear that the testator was, at the signing thereof, of sound and disposing mind, memory, and understanding. Therefore, if there were two other witnesses of equal judgment and veracity, not being under the same obligation to scrutinize the condition of the testator, nor having the same opportunity unless they happened to be present at the time, the preference should be given to the subscribing witnesses. Yet there may be circumstances which overbalance this preference. The subscribing witnesses may be of inferior intelligence and capacity — prejudiced and perverse or otherwise deficient in qualifications to inspire confidence, and the jury may not be able, notwithstanding their opportunity, to believe their statements or accept their opinion. In this case there is a singular incident which deserves the consideration of the jury. Mr. Livingston was called upon by Louisa Youngheim (for whom he had been frequently employed professionally) to draw her will. He went to her hojfse to obtain the proper instructions from her, made notes of her directions, returned with them home, and prepared the instrument, which he after-wards took with him to her house, where, in presence of these two subscribing witnesses and of John Eckert and himself, she executed the will which he had written for her, these identical witnesses signing it as subscribing witnesses. He remembers reading this will to her, but not in the presence or hearing of the witnesses (for that he says is not his practice), and its being explained by Mr. Eckert to her, and he also recollects, after it was executed, wrapping it in an envelope, endorsing and leaving it with Mr. Eckert, who was appointed executor in it. The will given in evidence in this case, being shown to Mr. Livingston, he testifies that he never saw this paper until he saw it here in court; and this paper is written by John Eckert, the plaintiff. Now the subscribing witnesses swear distinctly that they signed as witnesses but one paper as the will of Louisa Youngheim, and that this is the paper which they signed. They also swear that Mr. Livingston read and explained this paper on that occasion in their presence, whereas he declares that he never saw it before it was produced here in court. The defendant’s counsel contends that this is a contradiction which cannot be reconciled or explained; the plaintiff’s counsel urges that Mr. Livingston may, in the multiplicity of business, have forgotten the facts. If you can reconcile these conflicting statements, consistently jvith the integrity of the witnesses, you should do so; but, if you cannot, <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>and if it should he your opinion, that these witnesses did sign as subscribing witnesses the will prepared by John B. Livingston, and that he did not read and explain that paper to them or in their presence — much less the one in evidence which he says he never saw until it was shown to him here, you will consider whether that declaration on this point is true, and if not true, whether they believed it to be true; for if they made it knowing it not to be true, then there is a principle of law applicable to their testimony which may be stated thus : false in one particular, false in all. A witness undoubtedly may honestly mistake a fact from imperfectly observing or imperfectly remembering it to be a fact of such a nature that the misstatement is intentionally false — the witness forfeits all claim to belief. The credibility of testimony is peculiarly within the province of the jury, whether doubts upon the subject arise from prevarication, contradiction, or conflict of evidence, inconsistency, or any other cause; and in making these remarks, the court do not intend to indicate tlicir opinion on the facts or the effect of the testimony, but to aid you in applying the principles of evidence as cited from the authorities, so that you may decide the issue truly, according to the evidence in the case.</p>

That, however, was radical, and it pervaded every part of the trial. The paper'set up as the will of Louisa Youngheim was assailed on two grounds. The absence of a disposing mind in the testatrix, and undue influence exerted over her by John Eckert in procuring it, were both averred. It -was to prove the latter that the testimony of Mary Miller and Mary Fricker, recited in the first and second bills of exceptions, was offered, and it was on the assumption that some evidence of undue influence had been given that the court put the case to the jury, to find whether the testatrix was unduly influenced by the plaintiff, or (as the learned judge said in that part of his charge to which the fifth assignment of error relates) “ whether he improperly induced her to cut off her child from the benefit of her worldly goods and property; in short, to make the will as he directed, not according to her independent will and wishes.” It might -well be remarked that from such a mode of putting the case to them, the jury would readily conclude that inducing the testatrix to disinherit her child was the exercise of an improper influence, an influence which the court had elsewhere denominated undue, and which, if it was exerted, would avoid the will. And even if the court intended no such thing, still the verdict was made to turn upon their finding whether John Eckert had unduly influenced the testatrix to make the will. Now, that is undue influence which amounts to constraint, which substitutes the will of <a id="p52" href="#p52" data-label="52" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*52</a>another for that of the testator. It may be either' .through threats or fraud, but, however exercised, it must, in order to avoid a will, destroy the free agency of the testator at the time when the instrument is made. In the language of Woodward, J., in McMahon <em>v. </em>Ryan, 8 Harris 329, “it must be a present constraint, operative on the mind of the testator in the very act of making the testament.” The paper asserted in this case to be a will was dated on the 21st of June 1858, and was then executed. Unless, therefore, there was some evidence tending legitimately to prove that some fraud had been practised upon the testatrix at that time, or that some misrepresentation had then been made, or that some physical or moral coercion had been employed, such as to destroy her free agency, the court erred in submitting to the jury the question whether undue influence had been exerted. It was inviting them to find as a fact that of which there was no evidence, and which the law as well as reason presumed had no existence. Undoubtedly, if the mind of the testatrix was weak, it required less influence to control her will than it would have required to control the will of one whose mind was in full vigour-. But neither moral nor. physical constraint is to be inferred from mental weakness alone. That undue influence which suffices to destroy an alleged will is distinct from weakness, and has no necessary connection with it. And we find in this record no evidence o f any undue influence, or of any influence at all, exerted by John ■Eckert over the mind of the testatrix to induce her to make this will, and none has been pointed out to us by the earnest counsel of the defendant in error. There is nothing which tends to prove that he practised upon her any fraud, that he made any misrepresentation, or in any manner constrained her, in June 1858, when the will was made. And no motive was shown for the exertion of undue influence. The will was not made in his fevour or in that of his relatives, and he does not seem to have any ill feeling towards the disinherited daughter. The fact, if it was a' fact, that months after the will was made which appointed him executor,, he exercised control over her affairs, and even over herself, during her advanced age, unconnected as it was with the testamentary act, was no evidence from which the jury could infer that the will was not her own : McMahon <em>v. </em>Ryan, 8 Harris 329.</p>
