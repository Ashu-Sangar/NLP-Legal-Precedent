This denomination continued to flourish and spread over the state, forming many congregations, having no connection with each other until the year 1830, when a confederation took place, as was testified to, for the mere purpose of co-operation; by which an eldership was formed Ayhich was soon after known as the East Pennsylvania Eldership; another vras established in the western part of the state about the same time. This East Pennsylvania Eldership adopted a constitution about the year 1832, but its nature or character cannot be precisely ascertained, as no copy thereof was presented to the court. The constitution given in evidence, Avhich Ayas an amendment of the former, was adopted in October 1852. By the year 1845 the denomination had extended over many of the western states, when it was resolved to establish a general eldership, which was to be composed of delegates from all the elderships, who were to meet once in three years. A constitution for its government was adopted, and this general eldership was invested with a degree of control over all the churches; among other things, yyith the licensing of preachers, and certain appellate powers from the inferior elder-ships. The'locating and removal of pastors, and arranging the limits and boundaries of congregations, was vested in the local elderships, Ayhich acted through its committees; it also seems to have been invested with power to suspend, and probably to expel a clergyman for cause, as also the lay members or elders and deacons of the congregations. On the 21st of April 1857, the East Pennsylvania Eldership was incorporated by an Act of Assembly, but no special or particular powers were conferred by the charter in regard to the government of the church. Both the complainants and respondents always recognised the constitution and power of the eldership down to 1858, when this dispute commenced. It is provided in the constitution of the general eldership, that no person shall be an accredited minister in the Church of God, without a regular license, and all the preachers in good standing shall have their licenses renewed annually by the eldership of which they are members. The constitution of the East Pennsylvania Eldership provides for ministers making an annual report, which if approved, their licenses shall be renewed. The same instrument gives a com<a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>mittee all the power of the eldership, except to expel or change preachers without cause. It may try, and suspend a preacher, change appointments or remove him, provided it is done through the application of a preacher, or a church acting by its elders. The stationing committee is authorized to locate the ministers and fix the boundaries, and its action is final, unless rejected by the vote of a majority, in which case the committee ave to take it back and report another; and all persons asking for an appointment as pastor are required to take the one allotted to them under penalty of not receiving one for a year. No one was permitted to preach in this church from 1830 forward without a regular license, and being stationed in the congregation by a committee of the eldership. And from the words of the constitution, the practice of the church, and the general understanding as proved, no clergyman could be forced upon a particular congregation, without its consent and against its will. But a single exception to this practice was proved by some of the witnesses. All of the defendants, from time to time, attended the meetings of the elderships, recognised the usages of the church, and many of them assisted in forming the constitution, or were present when it was done. Its validity and binding force was never denied prior to this dispute. By the terms of the charter of incorporation, this church is enabled to take and hold, by its rulers and elders and their successors in office, for the use of said church, lands, tenements, choses in action, &amp;c., not exceeding a certain annual value or income, and the same to grant, bargain, and sell, for the use of said church or congregation. Certain persons are named as elders, to wit, John Young, Isaac Stees, Jacob Miley, and Michael Newman, with a provision that they shall be kept up by annual elections, and to them is given the control and management of all the secular and pecuniary affairs of the church, with the care of the house and the church property now or hereafter belonging to them ; and the elders, with the pastor of the church, shall compose a church council, who shall have the sole control of the spiritual concerns of the church. Under the powers thus conferred, and pursuant to a resolution of the congregation, sale was made of the Bethel on Mulberry street, used as a place of worship when the congregation was incorporated, and a lot purchased on Fourth street, on which the Bethel or church in dispute was built. The deed for a portion of the property, dated April 1st 1854, is made to John Young,'Jacob Miley,'David Lingle, and Isaac Stees, “elders of the Church of God at Harrisburg, their successors and assigns,” and for the other portion, dated January 8th 1856, to John Young, Jacob Miley, Isaac Stees, and Michael Newman, “elders of the Church of God at Harrisburg, their successors in office and assigns.” The evidence showed that the property was pur<a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>chased and house built with the proceeds of sale of the old Bethel belonging to the congregation, with money raised by subscription or donations, and certain sums borrowed for which they are still indebted.</p>

At that time the church and congregation were under the pastoral charge of the Rev. Mr. Colder, in pursuance of his appointment thereto by the eldership, at its yearly meeting next preceding that time, who continued to officiate until September 1857, when he removed to Shippensburg and assumed the position of principal of the “Shippensburg Collegiate Institute,” and the pastoral charge of the Church of God in that place (the latter by appointment from the standing committee); and elder William Mooney was appointed to take his place as pastor of the Church of God at Harrisburg. At the annual meeting of the eldership that same fall at Middletown, where Mr. Colder and John Young with others were present as delegates from the Shippensburg and Harrisburg churches, these appointments were confirmed by the eldership; and James Colder and William Mooney reappointed by the eldership to the respective pastoral charges, then severally occupied by them, for another year.</p>

The defendants with others refused to acquiesce in the appointment of elder Flake, and held a meeting in the Bethel and selected James Colder pastor of the church and congregation. The standing committee held several meetings, of which the parties had due notice, and at the first of said meetings a letter was received from J. Young, J. Miley, T. F. Boyer, and Isaac Steos, elders of the said Church of God at Harrisburg, wherein they requested said committee to confirm the election of James Colder as paster of the Church of God at Harrisburg. At the second meeting, the business being still before them and not disposed of, a letter from the elders of the Church of Shippensburg to the elders of the Church of God at Harrisburg, releasing James Colder from his charge as pastor of the church at Shippensburg, was put into the hands of the committee. The committee at both of said meetings declined to take final action in the premises, because of the neglect of James Colder to appear before them. They appointed a third meeting-on the 10th of August, A. D. 1858, further to consider the subject referred to them, and directed notice thereof to be served on said James Colder, to the effect that if he did not appear and <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>submit his case to their consideration and action they would proceed to dispose of the subject without such appearance and submission.

On the 1st of April 1859, Rev. A. X. Shoemaker, in pursuance of an appointment, also undertook to occupy the pulpit of said church, but was in like manner by the elders and congregation prevented from doing so, and informed that the church was already supplied by a pastor of their own choice.

And in many denominations, it is quite common, not to say that it is the usual rule, to omit all notice of the denominational bond in their congregational charter, and this without meaning to affect the character of the congregation, as it was before the charter, or to declare it independent. Section 9 of the charter expressly forbids its enumeration of powers and privileges from including others not enumerated. The powers given to the congregational officers are no more exclusive of denominational character, powers, and laws, than is common in church charters, and, rightly understood, are not at all inconsistent with the associate duties of the congregation.</p>
    <p id="b252-7" data-blocks='[["BL_252.5",252,[284,1394,1161,386]]]'>The legislature never means, by granting or allowing such charters, to change the <em>ecclesiastical </em>status of congregation, but only to afford them a more advantageous <em>civil </em>status. And so this charter has been understood by this congregation ever since it was granted; for it has continued all its associated action, without change, up to the time of this dispute. And it could not reasonably have supposed that the charter changed its ecclesiastical law relative to the appointment of pastors, for the charter declares nothing on that subject.</p>
    <p id="b252-8" data-blocks='[["BL_252.6",252,[284,1781,1162,502]]]'>It is argued, moreover, that every congregation is proved to be independent, because it is so declared in the “ History of the Church of God,” given in evidence, and especially because it is there declared that churches should be formed “ subject to no extrinsic or foreign jurisdiction, and governed by their own officers, chosen by a majority of the members of each individual church.” This history is admitted to be an authentic exposition of the doctrine and order of the church, and was written by John Winebrenner, who was the founder of the sect, and who, as part of this quarrel, was expelled from the church, and died in expulsion, if the action of the majority of this congregation is to be sustained.</p>
    <p id="b252-9" data-blocks='[["BL_252.7",252,[285,2293,1161,130]],["BL_253.1",253,[246,391,1171,520]]]'>Not much is to be made out of the word “ independent,” for in ordinary usage its meaning is very indefinite. The tenant of the poor-house likes to call himself an independent citizen, and <a id="p253" href="#p253" data-label="253" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*253</a>no one need object very seriously to this, so long as he conforms to the laws of the place. Others have a better right to claim this distinction, and yet all must submit to the laws of the land. No man or body of men can be entirely independent of society and its laws. And yet there is a measure of independence in all associations, and its extent can be ascertained only by an observation of the facts that define it. And so, the expression “subject to no extrinsic jurisdiction” may have a relative, but not an absolute, value. It cannot, in the face of the other documents of the church, and of its uniform practice, save the several congregations from dependence on the annual eldership for its pastors ; and that is the material point here.</p>
    <p id="b253-6" data-blocks='[["BL_253.4",253,[255,909,1168,1032]]]'>The defendants consider it some support of their case that the same document declares that co-operation, not legislation, is the <em>main </em>object of the meetings of the annual eldership. Another sentence of the same document, however, presents some qualification of this one : “ if she (the general church) is a society of saints, then a congenial government is necessarily implied, for no society can well exist without order, and order supposes rule, discipline, and control: and these imply a controlling power.” It follows therefore that some legislation is necessary, and that for the purpose of securing the “main” object, co-operation. These terms accord with the usual functions of such bodies in other denominations; co-operation rather than legislation, and legislation in aid of co-operation. And it is expressly in general accordance with other such assemblies, that the eldership is formed, where it is declared in the constitution, art. 2, that the Annual Eldership is “for the transaction of such business as properly pertains to ecclesiastical bodies.” Certainly it is not an illegitimate form of co-operation for their assemblies to assign to each minister his station, and especially it is not inconsistent with the principle of co-operation that this' assignment is expressly declared to be a function of the annual eldership. When, it <em>legislates </em>beyond this to the injury of any member or congregation, it will be time enough to investigate its functions more closely. We do not need to do so now.</p>
    <p id="b253-7" data-blocks='[["BL_253.5",253,[259,1941,1164,301]]]'>To ju-stify the rejection of the pastor appointed by the annual eldership, the defendants rely on article 14 of the constitution, which declares that the stationing committee “ shall appoint the preachers to the several stations and circuits, and their report shall always be final and conclusive, <em>except it be rejected by a vote of a </em>majority, in which ease the convention shall take it back, and report another, subject to like action.”</p>

But the evidence shows that such has never been the practice of the church, and this is strong evidence against such an interpreta<a id="p254" href="#p254" data-label="254" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*254</a>tion. There is no evidence on the record sufficient to sustain it; and the ordinary practice of deliberative bodies is all against it. Article 13 provides for a <em>standing </em>committee to act for the assembly during its vacation in making and changing appointments of ministers. But the <em>stationing </em>committee acts only during the sessions of the assembly, and reports to it, not to the congregations ; and it is the reports thus made that are final and conclusive, unless rejected by a majority, and this seems to us very plainly to mean a majority of the annual eldership. To interpret it otherwise would require evidence that has not been furnished to us, and which, we suppose, does not exist. We infer, therefore, from this and other parts of the constitution, and from the common practice, that the appointments of the stationing committee, not disapproved of by the annual eldership, are binding upon the congregations.</p>
    <p id="b254-6" data-blocks='[["BL_254.4",254,[303,1041,1166,730]]]'>But it is argued that this congregation has always been accustomed to choose its own pastors, and that therefore their choice of Mr. Colder was not disorderly. There is, however, no reliable evidence in support of this allegation. Their congregational minutes show no instance of such an election until after this dispute began. No doubt there were often informal meetings of the elders or leading members, or even of the congregation, for the pui’pose of agreeing upon preachers whom they would request the eldership to send them; the evidence shows this. But this does not prove any <em>law </em>of the congregation, or of the denomination, but only an indulgence or liberty; a liberty not to <em>elect </em>a pastor, but only to suggest one whom they would like to have. The appointment of a pastor has always come from the annual eldership, and no reliable instance is given of a contrary practice, unless possibly for the temporary supply of an accidental vacancy. Mr. Croll seems to have been an instance of this, and he was afterwards appointed by the annual eldership.</p>
    <p id="b254-7" data-blocks='[["BL_254.5",254,[295,1770,1172,590]]]'>It might be possible that the annual eldership should so far offend the wishes of the congregation, and disregard the fitness 'of things, and the expectations raised by its own customary modes of acting, that equity might justify or excuse a congregation in rejecting its appointments, and in choosing a pastor for themselves, but in this case we find nothing of the sort. In almost all instances the annual eldership sent to this congregation the pastor whom they desired, and no doubt they treated all other congregations in the same manner, as nearly as was practicable. In such matters each one is necessarily liable to some disappointments. If there was any favoured church, it was the one at Harrisburg ; and this was quite natural, as it was perhaps the most influential, and was the mother church of the denomination.</p>

Surely this indulgence exhibits a degree of respect for Mr. Colder personally which can be accounted for only on the supposition of high qualities possessed by him, and this may also indicate the grounds of the attachment to him of so many of this congregation, notwithstanding his disorderly course. The evidence reveals to us no reason why this respect and indulgence of the annual eldership has not been reciprocated. The utmost that the majority can attain by persistence in this insubordination, can only be the establishment of a new sect, which, according to the ordinary practice of giving names, the world will call “ Colderites.”</p>
    <p id="b255-6" data-blocks='[["BL_255.4",255,[285,1561,1172,551]]]'>Suppose this congregation was at one time independent. Then it is argued it may at any time resume its independence. We do not concede the conclusion; though there may be special cases wherein such a result may be reached. The principle that governs in such cases is good faith to all the members of the congregation, and that can be preserved only by a loyal adherence to the authorities and organic constitution that wTere in existence at the time they became members. They can complain of no changes that are made in their organic laws by their legitimate authorities in pursuance of the constitution, but all changes otherwise made, without their consent, are a violation of good faith to them, however great may be the local majorities that attempt them.</p>

We see no evidence of it. It was John Winebrenner that gathered and nurtured this flock, and it was thus and not by election that he became the pastor of it. And, judging this event by others, he instructed and appointed the preaching elders, who assisted in gathering, nurturing, and organizing other flocks. And when, after five years of labour, <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>in 1830, he and his five assistants met together to form a regular organization and constitution, most likely they did nothing mate-rally different, in relation to the appointment of pastors, from what they had been doing before. It is only after that, that we become possessed of the exact outlines of the system of organization, and possibly before that they had not become distinctly conscious of it themselves. It is not necessary for us to be able to say when its associated form became complete. Growing things are not susceptible of precise definition. We cannot say exactly when a boy becomes a man, or when a sapling becomes a tree. It is sufficient, when we are called upon to test the legitimacy of any particular act of an ecclesiastical organism, that we are able to discover and define the law of the organism that applies to the case, whether it be old or new, and whether we can trace its history or not.'</p>

The trustees, who are the elders, hold the property for the use of the congregation, and that consists of all those who are in full communion with the church, and who adhere or are willing to submit to the regular order of the church : and adherence to the general denomination, while it continues sound and orderly, is one of the essential elements of that order. According to the fundamental, legal, and equitable principles of such associations, that majority which makes use of its corporate forms for the purpose of instituting an organized resistance to the legitimate authority of their ecclesiastical superiors; that expels the members of the minority for refusing to contribute to the support of their disorderly organization ; and that institutes as its pastor a regularly expelled minister of their denomination: such a majority is not the true congregation.</p>

Moreover, even without the expulsion, we discover no principle of this denomination, by means of which he can at all be recognised as a minister of the gospel: for he never was one, except by virtue of the annually renewed license of the annual eldership, and his last license expired in the end of the year 1859 or the beginning of 1860.</p>
