In fact he was to testify against his interest, as under certain circumstances it might render him liable on his assignment. But it is said that he was the endorser on the promissory note, which this mortgage was given to secure, and that a judgment in favour of the defendant in this suit, could be given in evidence in an action against him as endorser. Is this so ? If the nominal plaintiff were no party to the record, he would have been competent, because he could not use it for such a purpose, and why should he not be considered in the same light as if a legal assignment had been made and the suit would then have been brought in the name of the assignee.. Besides, if the judgment was obtained on his own testimony, he could not use it in any other suit by the equitable plaintiff.</p>
