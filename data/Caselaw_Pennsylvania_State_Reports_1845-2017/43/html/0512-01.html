He died intestate, leaving personal estate for distribution. John H. Baughman was appointed administrator of the decedent. On the 14th February 1845, the administrator filed his account, showing the amount in his hands for distribution, and on the 16th August 1845, the court appointed an auditor to distribute said amount. The only party in interest represented before the auditor was Elizabeth Baughman, a sister of the full blood of decedent. The auditor was of opinion that under the testimony before him, a legal presumption of the death of the other sister of the full blood arose, and he did not appear to have heard of the half-sis'ter. On 4th November 1846, he filed his report awarding the whole amount for distribution to Elizabeth Baughman, which report was confirmed, by the court, and on 25th November 1846, the administrator paid over the amount in his hands, as therein directed. Between eleven and twelve years afterwards, the parties in interest who had not attended before the auditor, procured the passage of an Act of Assembly, dated the 22d day of April 1857 (Pamphlet Laws 280), which enacts, “ That it shall be the duty of the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny county, on the petition of any party in interest, to grant a review of the administration account and auditor’s report, and <em>decree of distribution </em>thereon, of John H. Baughman, administrator of Andrew Hen<a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>drickson, late of Versailles township, Allegheny county, deceased, with the same effect as if application had been made within five years next after such decree,” &amp;c. Under this act an auditor was appointed, who made a report distributing part of said estate to parties who had not appeared before the former auditor. These new parties made no application for a review of the report of the former auditor, within five years after it was confirmed, but stood solely upon the Act of Assembly of 22d April 1857, as the means of enforcing their claims in this case.</p>

It docs not direct the performance of a judicial function in a particular way. It does not rest on the doctrine of Bradlee and Brownfield, that the legislature posseses a mixed jurisdiction, partly legislative and partly judicial. It simply removes a barrier which prevents the court from granting such relief as justice and equity may require ; in which respect it differs from De Chastellux <em>v. </em>Fairchild, 3 Harris 18. The act interferes with no vested rights. The administrator, standing in the position of trustee, could have none against the appellee.

Baughman, administrator of Andrew Hendrickson, in which the petitioners claim a share of the estate of the decedent as next of kin. It was presented thirteen years after his death, and eleven years after the estate had been distributed and finally settled by the decree of the court. It is therefore barred by the Act of 8th April 1833, § 19, relating to the distribution of intestates’ estates, and requiring such claims to be presented within seven years after the intestate’s death; by the Act of 13th October 1840, § 1, requiring that bills of review shall be brought within five years after the final decree; and without this, by the limitation of seven years for writs of error, which is received as a binding analogy for bills of review, when there is no positive rule given by the legislature.</p>

This is a very clear and peremptory legislative injunction, unevadable by any skill of interpretation. Yet it does not affect the proviso of the Act of 1840, which limits the bill of review to cases where the balance has not been actually paid by the accountant, as was the fact here. This proviso might produce injustice in some cases, if there could be no bill of review, <em>as against the </em>distributees, in case of payment to them; but we pass this. The Orphans’ Court obeyed the legislative injunction by granting the review, and, on final hearing, dismissed the bill on the ground that the case was <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>entirely a judicial one, and the legislature had no authority to interfere.</p>

There can be no constitutional objection to the commands of the legislature, or of any one else, to the courts to hear any motion or petition that any party may choose to present ; but if the courts are the judicial authority of the land, no one has any authority to direct them what disposition they shall make of any case or question that comes before them. And any commands about such matters, other than those contained in the general law of the land, are quite useless; for the courts are, by the constitution, open to everybody appearing in any regular way. And they hear everybody that comes; though in cases very plain or very absurd they may not hear them long, and may dismiss their motion or petition without hearing the other side.</p>

It is in general guarded against by allotting to each department its appropi’iate functions, and by the assurance of the constitution of open courts, where every man for every injury shall have remedy by due course of law. A man’s rights are not decided by due course of law, if the judgment of the courts upon them may be set aside or opened for further litigation by an Act of Assembly. That would be a plain violation of the due course of law, a departure from the functions of legislation, and an assumption of those of jurisdiction.</p>

But that is not arbitrary nor unconstitutional which, within the sphere of politics, makes general laws for all cases in the class that is at the time the subject of legislation, if it be in reasonable harmony with <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>the intelligence, usages, and customs of the people.

It gives the rules and implements of justice, but uses none of them. It hears no parties, just because it has no particular case before it. Jurisdiction is always engaged in applying the standards of right to particular cases of disputed right, and therefore always deals with parties, and therefore always hears them.</p>

It is practice, however, and not knowledge that is thus divided and restricted. To be truly intelligent and orderly, each department ought to understand, but not to undertake the functions of the other. In the present case the practical distinction seems to us quite as clear as the theoretical one.
