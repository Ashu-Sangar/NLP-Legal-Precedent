They have, therefore, not executed the power vested in them. They have neither ratified nor re-enacted their void ordinance. Ratification itself would be an ordination, and can be proved only by showing the written ordinance or some equivalent.

Indeed, if we consider the subject carefully, we shall have reason to conclude that it is rather as law than as contract that this matter can become binding upon the people; for no one of them is party to it as a contract, but only subject to it as a law binding him and his property within the limits to which it applies as law. Then, as delegated legislation, its defects can be cured only by the legislative superiors of the councils, or by their own ordinary power and action. They have not cured it, and no court or legislature or other superior officer has until now been called upon to notice it. As a law, therefore, its validity still remains open for decision.

L. 408, limiting the amount of the city debts, and by the fact, admitted by the demurrer, that that limit had been already reached. Second, that section of the Act of 1843 is repealed with reference to Pittsburgh, and was repealed before the subscription was complete by the Act of 12th April 1853; because this act applies specially to Pittsburgh, limits the amount of the subscription, and prescribes the mode of effectuating it; it grants the authority and limits and‘regulates its exercise, and therefore supplies and repeals, or supersedes the former act, and no appeal can be made to it: <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Mass.%20445" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 Mass. 445">12 Mass.

Under that act no subscription could be made without an ordinance of councils directing it, and made in pursuance of it.

And now I must acknowledge that it was not unreasonable that I should fail; for the judgment of the people and of several successive legislatures and governors of the state, and of our own city councils, and of the legislatures of several other states, and every Supreme Court of other states that had considered the subject, was against the conclusion to which I had arrived; .and certainly the judgment of such a host of reflecting men cannot be thought unreasonable, except by minds that are unreasonably selfish and arrogant. My opinion is good for nothing against such a host, and there can be no use in retaining it.</p>
    <p id="b398-8" data-blocks='[["BL_398.6",398,[311,2030,1171,388]],["BL_399.1",399,[221,391,1177,471]]]'>But when I advanced it, the evils of the legislation referred to had not developed themselves, and the public mind was in high hopes of realizing a golden harvest of benefits from the projected railroads, and I knew that if I should succeed, with the aid of any of my brethren here, in preventing the municipal subscriptions by having them declared unconstitutional, I should be severely censured by most of my fellow-citizens at home; because their hopes would be instantly disappointed, and they could never learn the depth of the distress and trouble from <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>which the decision would have saved them. The people persisted in the course, which my brother Lewis' and I attempted to shut against them, and which experience has since induced the people to shut by a constitutional amendment, and through their representatives and other officers, they got all the legislation and other official acts that they desired; and now, when the day of hope and promise is gone, and the day of reality and reckoning is come, all the members of this court are held up to public odium because the people are held to the law of their contract; and their oavu officers, who were the actors in producing this aa^eresult, are held in honour.</p>
    <p id="b399-5" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[222,865,1171,302]]]'>This is a very great fault. I do not condemn those officers, for I doubt not they acted honestly and according to the best of their judgment, and according to their belief of what the people desired. They did therefore as public officers usually are expected to do who are not judicial officers, and it would be unreasonable to condemn them, however we may regret that they were not wiser, and had not a wiser public opinion to guide them.</p>
    <p id="b399-6" data-blocks='[["BL_399.5",399,[217,1169,1176,1074]]]'>But all orderly men everywhere, who have no personal interest in these questions, and who are interested only in favour of public order and public faith, and of the honour of our republican institutions, do condemn and must ever condemn the open rebellion against authority, and the dishonest means that have been persistently adopted and maintained in order to escape from these contracts and to evade the directions of the law. And so long as this system of measures is required of public officers, the people must expect to have only dishonest or weak and incompetent men to do their business, and will have to pay the penalty of this by the continual decay of their public interests, and degradation of public morality. No public officer can maintain his morality while evading and resisting the law of the land, and he must in such a case be a much worse man at the end than at the beginning of his term of office. And no set of men can fail to injure their own morality and that of their children, and to sacrifice their own sense of moral dignity (unless they take fanaticism or selfishness for diginty), by the persistent- resistance to law, and by the arts and contrivance to which this resistance leads. The cost which the people of this county have had to suffer in this form is already fearful in amount, besides the immense costs of suits which have been incurred, and the immense increase of taxes ■ that has taken place within a few years, without paying any of these debts. I trust that some such reflections as these may tend to bring people to some proper views on this subject.</p>
    <p id="b399-7" data-blocks='[["BL_399.6",399,[216,2237,1173,180]],["BL_400.1",400,[295,394,1169,431]]]'>I desire to add that though I have not assented to all the judgments in these cases, it must not be expected that I shall join in resisting any of them. On the contrary, it is my duty to join my brethren in all the lawful forms of enforcing them all that <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>shall be demanded by the plaintiffs; and I shall do so without any hesitation or evasion, and shall cheerfully bear my own share of the taxes they require. No doubt I shall by this give offence to many of my fellow-citizens whom I most sincerely respect; but the time will come when they will think differently. Grood promises abound in favour of the faithful and the patient, and I await their fulfilment. No violent movement can be suddenly calmed. Justice with patience bides its time. An orderly opposition might long ago have obtained a proper compromise of these very burdensome debts. It may do it yet; I hope for it.</p>
    <p id="b400-5" data-blocks='[["BL_400.4",400,[294,825,1169,601]]]'>Many citizens who are quite as orderly as any on all other subjects, have actively engaged in this organized resistance of law, and have perhaps been pleased to discover how weak our system of government is against local disaffection and organized disorder. But they are, by this experiment, teaching this secret to other minds who have no. love for social order, and for that mode of acquiring social comforts and happiness. The next time the experiment is tried it will fall into worse hands, and even the present one is sure to do so if long continued, and then we cannot calculate the consequences. I do not venture to enlarge upon this thought, but reflecting men ought not to cast it from them. We are now dearly paying for a similar experiment on the power of our national organization. <em>“ </em>If ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.”</p>
