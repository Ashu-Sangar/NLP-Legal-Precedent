The record of the justice did not disclose the nature or amount of plaintiffs’ claim, but did show that a summons had been issued and served; that on the return day the parties had appeared, and on hearing that a judgment had been confessed for 189.83, and that it did not appear whether or not this was the full amount of the claim up to the confession. The whole proceeding was adversary. The 14th section of the Act of 1810 prohibits the justice from taking cognisance of any matter or thing exceeding $100, unless the parties appear voluntarily, &amp;c., and the cases of Brenneman <em>v. </em>Greenawalt, 1 S. &amp; R. 30, Camp <em>v. </em>Wood, <a href="/watts/10/0118-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="10 Watts 118" data-case-ids="1850998" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0118-01">10 Watts 118</a>, Phillips’s Appeal, 10 Casey 495, and King <em>v. </em>King, 1 Penna. Rep. 15, permit the entry of judgment for a larger amount only where the defendant’s appearance is voluntary, and he confesses judgment, or the parties submit their claims by reference, which was not the case here, as is shown by the transcript of the docket. See Alberti <em>v. </em>Dawson, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Binn.%20206" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Binn. 206">1 Binn. 206</a>, Camp <em>v. </em>Wood, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%20121" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="10 Watts 121">10 Watts 121</a>. The case of Butler <em>v. </em>Urch, 1 Grant’s Cases 227, <em>seems </em>to overrule Camp <em>v. </em>Wood, but could not have been so intended, because the latter is not alluded to. Besides, though decid^l in 1858, it never was reported by the official reporter, and is nullified by Phillips’s Appeal, which was decided one year later, affirming Camp <em>v. </em>Wood.</p>

The 14th section of the Hundred Dollar Act gives justices of the peace jurisdiction of claims over a hundred dollars, “ if the parties voluntarily appear before him for that purpose ;” and we think now that this means appearing without any writ served, and that it has been so generally understood, as the cases cited in the argument show. We think now that voluntary appearance, not in answer to any process served, is a condition of the justice’s jurisdiction in such cases. And in the present case the judgment of the justice and its «affirmance below ought to be considered as expressing the true merits of the case, for it was confessed and signed by the defendant, and there is no pretence that it is not truly entered, or that there was any unfairness in the hearing. Yet possibly the Common Pleas might have reversed it, had it not been for the case of Butler <em>v. </em>Urch. They affirmed the judgment; can we review their decision ? We at first <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>thought yes, because of the want of jurisdiction appearing on the record. But we find, § 22, that one of the very purposes of the <em>certiorari </em>is to inquire whether the cause of action was <em>“ </em>cognisable before a justice of the peace,” and the next words make the judgment of the Common Pleas final, and exclude a writ of error. This is too peremptory to be overlooked.</p>
