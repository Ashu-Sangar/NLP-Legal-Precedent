That the note was given to enable said Maginnis to raise funds in the nature of advances to work the property— that the defendant had aided him before that time to raise money, by checks and other paper, which the defendant paid at maturity. That a short time after the above note had been forwarded by letter as aforesaid, he received a letter from Maginnis informing him that the letter was received, but had been opened by some person, and the note taken out, requesting the defendant to enclose another note, stating that if the note got into his possession he would return it. That the defendant enclosed another note for the same amount, payable the same length of time — that the second note was negotiated by Maginnis, was protested, suit brought against the defendant, and judgment obtained thereon by the holder. That after the time the first note would have been due, Maginnis stated to defendant that the note came into his hands through a person in his employ, and that he suspected him of having taken it from the letter, and promised defendant to return the note — that Maginnis afterwards failed, -without returning the note, and that the defendant never knew that any <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>one else held the note until he ivas informed by <em>H.

The defendant, on this representation, enclosed another note for the same amount, payable at the same length of time. This second note was negotiated by Maginnis, was protested, suit brought, and judgment obtained thereon against the defendant by the holder.</p>

W. Smith, Esq., that he held it for collection — nor ever received notice of protest or value for the note. It seems, from this statement, that Maginnis, by a false representation of the loss of this note, obtained a second note for his accommodation, against which the defendant had no defénce, as against the holder of it. As against Maginnis, he always had an ample defence to both notes, and it is clear that the first note has thrown round it a cloud of suspicion and fraud which calls upon the plaintiff to show that he obtained it upon a valuable consideration in the usual course of business before it Ayas due. <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>It comes within the principle of the cases of Hutchinson <em>v. </em>Boggs, <em>4 </em>Casey 294, Albietz <em>v. </em>Mellon, <a href="/wright/1/0375-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Wright 367" data-case-ids="626067" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0375-01">1 Wright 367</a>, for there ivas unquestionably a fraud practised by'tlie payee on the defendant.</p>
