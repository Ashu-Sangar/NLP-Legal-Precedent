Upon the hearing, this rule was made absolute; and a bond having been given on behalf of the claimant, the sheriff was directed to withdraw from the possession of the goods, and this issue was formed to try whether the goods levied on, including the stock of goods in both stores, were the property of Nelson Henry, the plaintiff in the issue.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b419-11" data-blocks='[["BL_419.9",419,[241,1783,1173,260]]]'>The court erred in charging the jury as follows, to wit: 1. “ It is clear, then, that he (plaintiff) did not become the owner of the goods by virtue of the purchase thereof by Whiting, whether the latter professed to act as his agent or not, inasmuch as the unauthorized act of Whiting could not vest in the plaintiff any title to the goods unless subsequently ratified.”</p>

If when the goods were levied on by the sheriff, the plaintiff himself had notified the sheriff', or had caused notice to be given, that they were Ms goods, that would have been evidence of his ratification of the purchase by Whiting. But the plaintiff did not give the notice. He was then in Texas. The notice was given by Whiting, and the affidavit in answer to the <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>plaintiff’s rule was made by Whiting, and, so far as we know, the plaintiff may even now be ignorant of the pendency of this issue. If there was any act shown to have been done by the plaintiff himself, there would be ground for an inference that he had ratified the purchase made in his name .by Whiting. But so far it appears nothing whatever had been done by him either in reference to the purchase or to the proceedings connected with this case.”</p>

In this decision the present plaintiff in error acquiesced, so far as regarded the goods levied upon in the store on the corner of Federal street and the South Common, in Allegheny City, and gave no evidence in relation to them at the last trial. The present case is confined to the stock of goods in the store formerly occupied by Jacob Burgraff, of which Henry claims to be the owner.</p>
    <p id="b420-13" data-blocks='[["BL_420.15",420,[285,2131,1172,338]]]'>These goods formerly belonged to Jacob Burgraff, and were sold by the sheriff upon an execution against him, and were bought in by Hood, Bonbright &amp; Co., and on the 23d February 1861, were sold by John A. Meehan for the said firm to Nathan Whiting, professing to act for Nelson Henry, and three days afterwards they were levied on by the sheriff as the property of Nathan Whiting, at the instance of his execution-creditors, the defendants in error.</p>

      <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>The sale to Whiting was on credit at five, six, and seven months, for which he gave his three promissory notes, dated 23d February 1861, signed by himself as agent, and secured by a mortgage of the same date, executed by Nathan Whiting and Helena his wife on her separate estate.</p>
    <p id="b421-6" data-blocks='[["BL_421.4",421,[268,615,1165,472]]]'>Nelson Henry was a blacksmith by trade, and on the 20th October 1860 left Pittsburgh for Texas, intending to remain there. He was employed as a striker on board the steamboat Carr by the month. He remained in Texas, and it does not appear that he ever <em>returned. </em>His means were limited, and whatever they were they were invested and remained so. No authority of any kind was shown from Henry to Whiting to purchase these or any other goods for him. The purchase, therefore, was an unauthorized one, and conferred no title in them upon Henry, but the title vested in Whiting, who was personally liable to the vendors upon his promissory notes.</p>
    <p id="b421-7" data-blocks='[["BL_421.5",421,[264,1087,1167,515]]]'>Now if Whiting had no authority to purchase for Nelson Henry, still less had he authority to engage counsel for him to claim the property so purchased as his. It is clear, then, that the counsel were really the counsel of Whiting, and their acts and proceedings could in no manner be claimed as a ratification of his clearly unauthorized purchase, so far as the absent Nelson Henry was concerned. All the facts in this case show conclusively that these goods were purchased by Whiting for himself, and not for Nelson Henry, and that the title was vested in him when these executions were levied upon them. The very clear and lucid opinion of Judge Williams renders it unnecessary to say more.</p>
