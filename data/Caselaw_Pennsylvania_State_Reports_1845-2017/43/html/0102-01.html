At the time of the making of this will, the testator expressed to the scrivener his intention to give to each of the children for whom he had stood godfather the sum of $50. Both the parties claimant were children for whom the testator had stood godfather. Of the daughters of John Lauez’, deceased, the only one for whom he had stood godfather was Cassazidra, and her married name (Emig) was mentioned in connection with this legacy, as was also the name of Lavinia. The auditor decided that Cassandra Emig was the only claimant that answered the description in the will, aizd that the mention of the name (Lavinia), as regards this particular legacy, was merely a mistake. The legacy was therefore awarded to Mrs. Emig.</p>

And, on the other hand, seein'g that the Lavinia whom the testator meant to make the object of his bounty, was described as a daughter of his brother, John Lauer, deceased, we could not prove that a daughter of his cousin, Abraham Lauer, was the person intended, though her name was Lavinia. We would be as likely to conclude that the legacy would lapse for want of a legatee, as that one and not the other of these relatives of the testator was the person intended to take. *</p>

As a daughter of John Lauer, deceased, Cassandra comes within one part of the <em>designatio persones, </em>whilst, Lavinia comes within another part, and both of them belong to a class of persons (godchildren of the testator) .to whom he declared his intention of giving legacies. In such an equal balance of circumstances, the presumption of law is that the court below got at the intention of the testator, and finding nothing upon the record to displace that presumption, we will let it stand.</p>
