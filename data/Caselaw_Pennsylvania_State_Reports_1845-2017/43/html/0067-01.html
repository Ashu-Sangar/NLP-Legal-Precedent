Meals, widow of Moses B. Meals (now wife of complainant), was the owner, in her own right, of a considerable amount of real estate, stocks, moneys, securities, and other personal property. That, on and before that day, there was a mutual contract of marriage subsisting between her and the complainant. That Calvin M. Duncan, Augustus Duncan, and William A. Duncan are brothers of tho half-blood of Mrs. Meals (now Reges), and knew this to he the ease. That they prepared, or caused to be prepared, a certain indenture, bearing date the 23d day of August 1859, and <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>presented the same to their sister, Mary W. Meals, for execution, by which she conveyed and transferred to them all her property, upon certain trusts nominated in the deed. That the indenture was prepared at the instance of the brothers, without the knowledge, consent, or wish of their sister, and without any instructions from her to do so; and that she signed the same unadvisedly and in ignorance of its legal effect, and of the nature, extent, and scope of the provisions and trusts therein contained, and through improper influence and persuasions used with her by the brothers to obtain her signature. That the Messrs. Duncan were actuated solely by selfish and avaricious motives in procuring the execution of the deed, and were not moved thereto by any feelings of friendship or kindness for their sister. That the complainant was married to Mary W. Meals on the 25th day of August 1859, two days after the execution of the deed, and that he had no knowledge of the existence of the deed until the-next morning after the marriage. The deed was not entered for recording until August 27th 1859. That when the complainant learned the contents of the indenture, he immediately communicated his information to his wife, who expressed great regret, mortification, and surprise at what she had done, and went to see Calvin M. Duncan, for the purpose of having the deed annulled.” That he refused to do so, because such an act was beyond his power, inasmuch, as upon certain contingencies mentioned in tbe deed, her infant daughter and the minor children of a deceased sister would become entitled to a portion of the property conveyed. That the execution of the deed, at the time and under the circumstances fully stated in the bill, was a fraud upon tbe marital rights of the complainant, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>

Duncan made answer upon oath, substantially denjdng all its material averments. In the answer of Mrs. Reges, she denied all knowledge of the nature of the deed, averring that she gave no direction for its preparation, and that its execution and acknowledgment were the result of imposition and persuasion. The Messrs. Duncan also demurred to the bill, alleging, for cause, 1. That if it be true, a-s is alleged in the bill, that Mary W. Meals did execute the indenture unadvised, in ignorance of its contents and legal operation, and through improper influence and persuasion exorcised over her by her brothers, that she should have been made a party to the hill of complaint, and not one of the respondents; 2. That, inasmuch as the complainant was not intermarried with Mary W. Meals at the date of the indenture, he had no marital rights in her estate of which he could be defrauded, even, if it were true that he was not informed of the existence of the deed prior to his marriage.</p>

Common candour forbids that so important a change in his intended wife’s circumstances, and in her power over her estate, should be made without his consent, and equity sternly condemns it as a fraud upon his just expectations. This principle of equity has stood the test of experience too long to be open to dispute now.</p>

It prevents the marriage from operating as a transfer of any of the wife’s property to the husband, and saves it for herself. The plaintiff had therefore a right to suppose that he was marrying her with all her legal power over her estate, <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>whereas by this arrangement it was secretly slipped into the hands of trustees, and out of her control, just before the marriage was consummated.

A fraud no greater than this would avoid any other contract than that of marriage; but as this cannot be avoided, equity avoids the contracts that are in fraud of it.</p>
