    <p class="summary" id="b90-8" data-blocks='[["BL_90.6",90,[312,694,1166,1060]]]'>The case was this: — George Snodgrass was largely indebted, and judgments were entered against him in the Court of Common Pleas of York county. His father, William Snodgrass, died intestate on or about the 1st of July 1857, leaving freehold real estate, and also personal property. D. &amp; D. A. Bupp held a judgment against George prior to his father’s death, on which they issued an attachment execution on the 6th of July 1857. The writ commanded the sheriff to “ levy and attach the goods and chattels, <em>lands, </em>debts, legacies, distributive shares, rights, and moneys of George Snodgrass,” &amp;c., and also to make known to George Snodgrass, and to Jesse Eppleman, administrator of William Snodgrass, deceased, to appear and show cause why the judgment recited in the writ <em>“ </em>should not be levied of the effects of the said George Snodgrass in the hands of Jesse Eppleman, administrator of said William Snodgrass, deceased.” The word <em>lands </em>was interlined. The sheriff returned that on the 6th of July 1857, he had “attached the defendant by his goods and chattels, moneys, dues, legacies, shares, &amp;c., in the hands of Jesse Eppleman, administrator of William Snodgrass, deceased,” and summoned him as garnishee; and had also attached defendant’s interest in two tracts of land (describing them). “ The names of the parties, with the date of the execution of the writ, and the amount of bail required,” was not entered in the judgment docket, nor was any entry made of the execution of the writ on said docket.</p>

Small issued a <em>fieri facias </em>on a judgment in their favour against George Snodgrass, and levied upon his estate in the land, formerly of William Snodgrass, deceased, and then in his possession. After inquisition a <em>venditioni </em>was issued, upon which the plaintiffs bought the estate of the defendant in the land for the sum of $140, the net amount of which was paid into court for distribution. The court referred the matter to John Gibson as auditor, who awarded the money to D. &amp; D. A. Bupp, on their execution attachment.</p>

Rupp, on a judgment against George Snodgrass, issued an attachment execution, under which the sheriff, on the same day, attached <em>inter alia </em>the interest of the defendant in two tracts of land which his father had died seised of, intestate. This was the first lien upon his interest in the real estate of the decedent. On the 8th July 1857, John Straley filed two transcripts which were duly entered, and on the 9th July in the same year, P. A. &amp; S.
