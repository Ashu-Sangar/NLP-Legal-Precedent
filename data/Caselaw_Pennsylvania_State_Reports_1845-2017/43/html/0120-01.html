The plaintiffs, private bankers, claim to have discounted the notes in the usual course of business. Taking these notes as exhibited in court, without any explanation, the endorsers are discharged. They seem to have been drawn by Myers &amp; Shour, endorsed by them, then by D. Myers and defendant, and afterwards by Myers &amp; Shour, who, both as drawers and first'endorsers, were liable to make payment, <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>and as their names appear on the paper after the other endorsers, it will be presumed that they lifted the notes on account of their liability, and put them again into circulation, as it will not be presumed that they paid them before due. Coming back again into the hands of those originally liable, they are in law extinguished, and there can be no recovery against the endorsers; their obligation is discharged. How is it as explained by the parol evidence ? Dehuff, a clerk in the bank, testifies that shortly before these notes were discounted, Myers &amp; Shour wrote to them, asking if they could obtain the money required on such paper, with D. Myers and William Eckert as endorsers; an answer Avas sent, and the next day in each ease the note thus prepared and endorsed was presented to, and discounted by, the bank. Each A\Tas presented by Shour on the days they respebtively bear dates, and were then, in presence of the witness, endorsed by Myers &amp; Shour, to show that they received the money. If you believe from this evidence, and other to Afhich Aye Avill refer, that D. Myers and Eckert were accommodation endorsers, the notes brought by Shour to the bank thus endorsed on the day of their respective dates, and then discounted by the bank, the mere re-endorsement by Myers <em>&amp; </em>Shour, for the purpose stated by the witness, Avill not destroy the negotiable character of the notes or binding effect of the endorsements, provided they never had been in circulation, and in that event there is nothing in the way of the plaintiffs’ recovery.

[Was Eckert an accommodation endorser ? On that subject you have the evidence of Dehuff as to the correspondence, to which you will give no weight, unless satisfied of the truth of the statement, and loss of the papers after diligent and sufficient search.] The production of the notes on the day of their dates respectively, endorsed as proposed, and the recitals in the assignments of the book accounts and bank stock which appear to have been accepted by D. Myers and Eckert, after it was known that the bank had discounted the paper, must all be considered. George Hoffman also testifies to facts tending to shoAY that he, Eckert, and D. Myers were all accommodation endorsers for Myers &amp; Shour. His evidence is referred to the jury in connection with that already mentioned. Mr. Hoffman mentions one fact much relied on by the defendant, that he and D. Myers were not to endorse any paper except that also to be endorsed by Hoffman, and if such was the contract of Myers &amp; Shour, those gentlemen would be discharged as endorsers, if the name of Hoffman Avas not obtained as endorser, unless it was taken by the holders in the <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>usual course of business. But if so taken by the plaintiffs without notice of the agreement, they would not be affected by it. It is said by the defendant’s counsel that these notes, as produced in court, are not negotiable, but extinguished, and that the true test of their character is the appearance of the paper when sued, and that, whenever the liability has to any extent whatever to be made out by parol evidence or extrinsic facts, it can in no sense be considered negotiated.”</p>

Regularly the last endorser should write over his name to “pay the holder,” “or drawer,” or give his check in favour of the holder; but neither are required for the purpose of negotiation, but merely to avoid any after contest about paying the proceeds to the wrong man. As a general rule the holder of such paper is presumed to be the owner, and for us to now say that the want of such endorsement or check would have the effect contended, would probably destroy one-half the contracts made in this state for the transfer or discount of negotiable paper.

If presented to the bank by Myers &amp; Shour on the days they respectively bear date, and the defendant was an accommodation endorser for the benefit of Myers &amp; Shour, the presumption is that the notes were made to enable them to raise money, which is evidence, and is strengthened by leaving them in their hands as holders of the notes; they could lawfully have them discounted, and, on the bank so doing, if Myers &amp; Shour endorsed the paper when they were about to hand it over merely to show that they had drawn the money, it did not destroy the negotiable character of the paper in the hands of the' bank, which had then received it; nor did it discharge the endorsers, but left it as it was before. If the money was then advanced by the plaintiffs’ bank in good faith on the credit of the endorsers and drawers, an understanding of the character spoken of and referred to in the point, not made known to those who discounted the paper, will not discharge or. relieve the endorsers.”</p>

It is not easy to see how one who has endorsed a promissory note, can be affected by the declarations of the maker, of which he had no knowledge, and which were made before the note had any existence. As against Myers &amp; Shour, the makers, the letter or its contents (for its loss was sufficiently proved) would have been legitimate evidence to show that the endorsements were made for their accommodation; that is, were such proof necessary. But how could the letter be evidence against Eckert? The court received it, not as proof of Shour’s declarations, but, to use the language of the judge, <em>“ </em>as evidence of contract.” What contract? If between Myers and Shour, or Shour and the plaintiffs, it was irrelevant to the case, <em>res inter alios partes. </em>If between the plaintiffs and the defendant, how could <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>the <em>ex parte </em>declarations of Shour tend to prove it ? In admitting this, we think the court inadvertently fell into an error, for which we should be constrained to direct a <em>venire de </em>novo, were it not that the mistake could have done the defendant no harm, and a reversal of the judgment would not prove of ultimate service to him. There was, it is true, other evidence from which the jury might well have found that he had endorsed the notes for the accommodation of Myers &amp; Shour. That other evidence is to be found in the recitals made in the assignments of the accounts and stock, and in the testimony of George Hoffman and Jacob Dehuff. Yet it would be impossible for us to know whether the jury did not rest their verdict in whole or in part upon Shour’s letter.</p>
    <p id="b127-6" data-blocks='[["BL_127.4",127,[272,969,1176,1416]]]'>But was it necessary for the plaintiffs to prove, by affirmative evidence, that the defendant was an accommodation endorser ? They had discounted the notes for the makers, on the day of their date, before their maturity, and with the defendant’s endorsements upon them. Under such circumstances wrere the endorsements not binding, unless it was proved that the notes had never before been negotiated, but were endorsed for the convenience of the drawers ? A bill or note which has been once in circulation, overdue, and coming from the hands of the acceptor or maker, is presumed to be extinguished: Byles on Bills 180; McGee <em>v. </em>Prouty, 9 Metcalf 546. This is because it was the duty of the maker or acceptor to take it up when it fell due, and therefore it is fairly inferrable from his possession of it, after that time, that it has fulfilled its office. But before it has fallen due, the maker of a promissory note is under no obligation to take it up, and the reason fails for presuming its extinguishment from his <em>then </em>having it in. his possession. And with the failure of the reason it is fair to conclude that the rule also ceases. When, as in this case, the maker offers for discount an endorsed note, on the day of its date, and before its maturity, the law does not infer from the endorsement and from the possession of the maker, that the note has been either paid or extinguished. It may be doubted whether the condition of such a note proves that it has ever been in circulation; whether, indeed, it is not rather a just inference that the endorsement was made for the accommodation of the maker, and the note left with him to raise money upon it. In Burbridge <em>v. </em>Manners, 3 Campb. 193, Lord Ellenborough said, “ Payment means, payment in due course, and not by anticipation.” “I agree,” said he, “that a bill paid at maturity cannot be reissued, and that no action can afterwards be maintained upon it by a subsequent endorsee. A payment before it becomes due, however, I think does not extinguish it any more than if it were merely discounted.”</p>

      <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>Now, possession by a maker after an endorsement certainly cannot amount to more than proof of paymenj. Burbridge <em>v. </em>Manners was a suit against the endorser of mipromissory note which had been paid four days before it became due, but not cancelled, and which afterwards came into the hands of the plaintiff before its maturity. The plaintiff was permitted to recover. And in Morley <em>v. </em>Culverwell, 7 Meeson &amp; Welsby 174, it appeared that a bill of exchange which had been accepted was satisfied four days before it fell due by the acceptor, and delivered up to him by the drawer uncancelled. It was held, notwithstanding this, that the drawer was liable on it to a party to whom the acceptor afterwards endorsed it for value, before it became due. This was the unanimous opinion of the Court of Exchequer, and the language of the barons completely vindicates their judgment. Lord Abinger, Chief Baron, said, “ The contract of the drawer and of' each endorser is, that the bill shall be paid by the acceptor at its maturity, not before it is due ; that it shall be paid according to its tenor and effect, that is, when it becomes due. If, upon its being discharged before it becomes due, the drawer inadvertently leaves his name upon the bill, he is but in the ordinary case of a party who has a bill in negotiation with his name upon it against his intention. It is in the hands of an innocent holder who has no notice that it has been discharged. Suppose mutual accommodation acceptances to be given, and to be exchanged before they have been negotiated, the names remaining on them, the parties may circulate them so as to give a title to a <em>bond fide </em>holder before they become due; and wherein does this case differ from that ? Therefore a bill is not properly paid and satisfied, according to its tenor, unless it be paid when due: and consequently if it he satisfied before it is due, by an arrangement between the drawer and' acceptor, that does not prevent the acceptor from negotiating it, or an innocent holder for value from recovering upon it.” In the same case Baron Parke said, “Nothing will discharge the acceptor or the drawer, except payment according to the law merchant, that is, payment of the bill at maturity. If a party pays it before, he <em>purchases </em>it, and is in the same situation as if he had discounted it.”</p>

Their doctrine is, that one who discounts such a note for the maker before it is due, according to its tenor, is an innocent holder for value, and is entitled to recover against any of the parties to it. They cover the present case, and they appear to be supported by sound reason. It <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>follows that the plaintiff in error could not have been hurt by the admission of the contents of Shour’s letter.</p>
