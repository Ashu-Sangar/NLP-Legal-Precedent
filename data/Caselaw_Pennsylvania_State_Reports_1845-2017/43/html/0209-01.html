On the 19th November 1853, Clark placed these mortgages in the hands of Bullitt &amp; Fairthorne for collection, who sent them to William P. Wilson, Esq., of Bellefonte, Centre county, who, it appears, employed W. A. Wallace, Esq., of Clearfield, who issued writs of <em>scire facias </em>upon them in the names of the mortgagees upon <em>praecipes </em>of Mr. Wilson, and who had writs of estrepement issued on both mortgages.</p>

He wrote to Mr. Wallace to discontinue the <em>scire facias </em>and estrepements, but not to satisfy the mprtgages. Mr. Wallace marked on the docket of the <em>scire facias, </em>“ settled by the parties.” On the 25th September 1854, Ephraim Clark assigned these mortgages to Henry Gerker, who, on the 11th July 1855, assigned the same to Jacob Binder and George Binder, the present plaintiffs below.

On the 16th January 1855, by deed recorded on the same day, Spencer Shoemaker and wife, and H. S. Harpe and wife, conveyed their interest in <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>the entire premises to Charles H. Shoemaker, subject as aforesaid. On the 10th September 1855, Charles II. Shoemaker conveyed his entire interest in the premises to William Levis, subject also as aforesaid, and on the 15th August 1857, Charles II. Shoemaker executed to William Levis a deed of confirmation of the title to these premises, which deed and the preceding one were both duly recorded on the 24th December 1857. This last deed is also “ under and subject nevertheless to the payment of the aforesaid two several mortgaged debts, and the interest hereafter to grow due thereon.” The liability, therefore, of these premises to the payment of the mortgages which are the subject of the two present suits appears in every link of the chain of title from the original mortgagor to William Levis inclusive.</p>
