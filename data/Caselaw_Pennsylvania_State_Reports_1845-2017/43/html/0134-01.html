But it must be recollected that this hill furnishéd by the architect to the building committee, was to inform them of the quantity required to floor their buildings. It had no reference to the thickness of the boards or their price, leaving that to the judgment and discretion of the committee. This bill was forwarded to Mr. Potter, which informed him that there were thirty-five thousand feet of flooring in the buildings, but without designating whether the boards required to cover the thirty-five thousand feet were to be inch or inch and a quarter, but he is asked to make a proposal for the manufacture and delivery of the lumber required for the buildings. Here, then, negotiations commenced between the parties for the sale and purchase. Boards of different thicknesses are used for flooring. The thickness is not named when the plaintiff is requested to put in his proposal, and not knowing whether inch and a quarter boards were wanted, he says, ‘ I will -furnish you If inch boards at $18 per thousand, or inch boards at $16 per thousand feet.’ In reply, Mr. McAllister says, ‘We accept your offer as to the yellow pine flooring, and will take the 1-]: inch.’ The contract is thus perfected and concluded, and we are asked to say what it means. Not a word is said by either party about superficial measure. The architect informs the <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>building committee that their buildings will require thirty-five thousand feet of flooring-boards, superficial measure. The committee forward this to the lumberman, and ask him to give them an offer. He -replies, ‘ I will furnish you with 1J inch boards at $18 per thousand..’ The offer is accepted. We are asked to say how the boards furnished are to be measured to ascertain the number of feet. The mode of measurement has been fixed by law, and we answer by saying, in the words of- the Act of Assembly, “All boards and plank shall be reduced to and counted as inch measure.” ' If the purchaser requires any other way of measurement, he must provide for it in his contract. This has not been done in the present case. And we therefore direct judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for $187.89, the amount of the debt with interest from 7th October 1858 <em>to </em>27th March 1862.</p>

If Potter had accepted the proposition in the terms used by the architect in his specifications prepared for the trustees, the word “ superficial” would have controlled the construction in the manner contended for by the counsel of the plaintiff in error. But the terms of Callahan’s specification, though communicated to Potter, were not adopted by him. He chose his own terms. And his proposition in his terms was accepted by the trustees. Then and there the contract was consummated, and under the Act of Assembly relating to board measure, we think it admits of no other construction than that which was given to it below.</p>
