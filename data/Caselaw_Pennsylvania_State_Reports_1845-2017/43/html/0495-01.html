If such a practice were tolerated it would lead to oppression and fraud. It has long been the policy of our statutes to forbid the withdrawal of appeals from awards of arbitrators without the consent in writing of the opposite party, and in Monongahela Navigation Company <em>v. </em>Blair, 8 Harris 78, the same rule was applied to an assessment of damages in a corporation case.

L. 637, the Quarter Sessions were empowered to lay out private roads, “ under the sur-' face of any land to coal-mines,” and by the 2d section of the Act of 28th March 1840, Purd. 848, 'incorporated companies and individuals were authorized to construct railroads with one or more tracks “ under the surface <em>over </em>any intervening lands, not exceeding six miles in length” — the proceedings in such case to be according to the Act of 1832, relative to lateral railroads. The word “ over” in the Act of 1840, is probably a misprint for “ of.” The' surface-owner, Shaw, is not made a party to this proceeding, and is not objecting to the road in question. How can Brown deny that he is an owner of “land?” He holds a conveyance duly -executed and recorded for “ fifty acres of merchantable black stone coal,” with rights of way above ground and under ground, through the lands of his grantor, and with privileges of drainage and ventilation, and he holds it all to himself, his heirs and assigns for ever. In Caldwell <em>v. </em>Fulton, 7 Casey 475, the nature of a mine interest severed from the ownership of the surface was very fully considered, and it was treated as a corporeal hereditament. Indeed it was said in terms that coal and minerals in place are land. There can be no question, therefore, that what Brown holds is within the very terms of the Act of 1840, and being a coal-bank, it is peculiarly within the spirit and intent of the act. For it was the purpose of all our legislation touching lateral railroads to bring coal and other minerals into market, and to this end every such road was designed to be a public highway, open to every transporter who would pay the legal tolls, as well as to the party whose capital <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>constructed the road. Brown’s coal needs a railroad for its outlet. There is far less reason for his objecting to the applicability of the Acts of Assembly to his mineral property, than there would be if he were a farmer on the surface, and the proposition were to run the road through his fields.</p>
    <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[314,628,1167,1545]]]'>Another objection that he urges is founded in the covenants of the deed, by which Moses Corey conveyed to him the stratum of coal under the fifty acres in question. He claims that the petitioners having purchased their landing and part of their coal from Corey, subsequently to his (Brown’s) purchase, were bound by Corey’s covenants, as running with the land. These covenants are the usual ones of seisin and warranty, and we do not see how they can estop the petitioners from proceeding under the Lateral Railroad Law. The argument seems to assume that the private property of Brown is to be taken for the private use of the petitioners — a thing which the legislature could not authorize to be done. If the Lateral Railroad Law had not been, long ago, rescued from this reproach, it had been condemned, long ago, as unconstitutional. It was founded in the experience of a great public want, and was passed for public purposes. Was not the development of our mineral resources a public object? Was it not a great public interest to augment the tonnage of canals and railroads, which had cost the state many millions to construct ? The man whose minerals lay within three miles of a state canal but could get them into it only by crossing the intervening land of an unneighbourly owner, had been taxed as well as his froward neighbour to build that canal — was it not reasonable and just to give him not a private, but a public way, he .paying all damages he should .occasion ? Nobody will doubt the state might enter and build a railroad on his land — it is equally clear that the state might delegate her right of eminent domain to a corporation or an individual. But then the entry is under the state and in pursuance of public law. No covenants or private contracts Between citizens can possibly be violated in such a case, because none can stand in the way of state authority. It is a resumption by the sovereign of a clear right of sovereignty, in subordination to which the covenants of the deed were made. Had the parties contracted expressly against the exercise of this right, they could not have bound the sovereign — much less can their covenants, made for other purposes, be permitted to have the effect claimed for them.</p>

The petitioners having built their road before the cause was tried, the defendant made a great number of unsuccessful offers of evidence on the trial, with a view of showing that it had materially impaired the value of his property. These were rejected for the general reason that the circumstances, to which the witnesses referred <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>themselves, were too indefinite and speculative in character. It would seem that several witnesses had been permitted to testify that the property was greatly depreciated by the construction and use of the petitioners’ road, but on cross-examination, when pressed for the grounds of their opinion they referred themselves to those circumstances, the direct proof of which had been rejected. “ These opinions” -(said the learned judge in his charge), “ being based on imaginary and contingent facts, too remote and uncertain to sustain them, must be disregarded by the jury, inasmuch as the evidence offered to prove these contingencies was rejected by the court.”</p>

The judge recognised the case and quoted from it, but gave the defendant no benefit whatever from it, because his witnesses had formed opinions on facts which the judge thought were insufficient to sustain them. This court had said, in that case, “ It is upon the whole tract the road is located, though only a part is actually occupied. The injury is therefore done to the tract <em>as a whole, </em>of whatever components that injury may consist. The exclusive appropriation of a part, the inconvenience arising from division, or from increased difficulty of access, and the cost of additional fencing, are alike the direct and immediate result of the construction, of the road.”</p>

They are <em>not </em>indeed to be assessed upon mere speculative theories, but such injuries as the common law recognises as fit subjects for compensation may be proved. And, as was said in the above-cited case, “ when damages are assessed, after the completion of a railroad, it is possible to prove, with some reliable certainty, the difference in the market value of the land through which it passes, caused by the construction. Then the value at the time of the entry on the land is known, and so is its value, as affected by the improvement.”</p>

The value of real estate which has not been offered in market is often a very difficult question. It belongs to that class of facts which exclude direct evidence to prove them, being such as are either necessarily or usually imperceptible by the senses, and therefore incapable of the ordinary means of proof. Pedigree, character, prescription, custom, boundary, and all those questions of skill and art to which experts are commonly called, are of this class. Now, when witnesses lay before a jury their opinions of the value of a particular piece of real estate, it is usual and proper to bring out the grounds of their opinions, that a jury may see how far they are sound and trustworthy. The grounds of the opinion, like the opinion itself, should generally be referred to the jury to judge of. They, should have been in this case. The jury’s estimate of the opinions of witnesses would necessarily be much affected by the grounds they rested on, and it was error to deprive the party of the full benefit of his testimony.</p>
    <p id="b506-7" data-blocks='[["BL_506.5",506,[278,1560,1166,428]]]'>What were the “imaginary and contingent facts” that led the judge to the exclusion of witnesses’ opinions ? He tell us that “ they were the dangers and delays of crossing the plaintiffs’ road.” Two underground railroads crossing each other at grade, and both worked in the darkness of a coal-mine, were sure, in the opinion of witnesses, to lead to disasters and loss of property, perhaps of life. They supposed that the road of the petitioners had virtually prevented Brown from building and safely working the road essential to the enjoyment of his own estate, and hence their estimate of his damages.</p>

But is an owner to wait for the damages to which he is entitled from a party entering into his land, until he shall have done his best to repair his injuries, and then charge only the insurmountable residue against the stranger ? The constitution, which requires the damages to be paid or secured <em>before entry </em>was not conceived in that spirit. It treats the landowner as entitled to the quiet <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>enjoyment of all his rights until he is compensated for giving them up. The supposition on which the witnesses went was not unreasonable, and considering that the damages were to be estimated before actual experience could be had of the working of distinct roads, we see no reason for excluding it.</p>
    <p id="b507-6" data-blocks='[["BL_507.4",507,[216,616,1172,566]]]'>The question may be difficult, but that is a reason why the facts and circumstances to which witnesses referred their opinions, should have been freely investigated. Railroads crossing each other at grade are always dangerous, whether in the darkness of the coal-mine or in the light of the upper day; but could not these roads, at a small increase of expense, be made to cross one above the other ? Was it indispensable that they should cross at all? Would not one road-bed, twenty feet wide, admit rails enough to serve both mines? The Act of Assembly provides that if parties cannot agree upon “ the mode, manner, or point of connection” of their respective roads, the same shall be determined by the viewers.
