If in the Common Pleas, it was void and confers no title. If in the Circuit Court, it is in conformity with law and is valid. To enable you to determine that fact you have, in the first place, the presumption that the officer does his duty, which may have some weight in showing that the sheriff acknowledged the deed in the right court. The prothonotary certifies that it was done in the Circuit Court; and, on the other hand, from the act of the recorder of deeds, you may infer that by possibility the wrong seal was affixed. It is to be presumed that the recorder did his duty in copying the instrument. That, however, is not conclusive. The entry-book gives us little aid, as it was used for the deeds of both courts; but there is an important fact apparent from the dockets and minute-books that the Circuit Court was in session on the 1st day of June 1809, when this deed purports to have been acknowledged, whilst the Common Pleas had adjourned over from the 15th of May till the last Monday in July of that year. The title at the end of the officer’s name, <em>‘Prot,’ </em>may have been written in that way erroneously from habit; or, truly, because it was in the Common Pleas — that is a question for you. It is difficult, after so great a lapse of time, to obtain any more certain evidence on either side. There was no law in 1817 authorizing sheriff’s deeds to be recorded, but the Act of the 14th of March 1846, renders valid records previously made, and that of the 4th of April 1844, cures the want of a seal; and, giving it a fair and liberal interpretation, would probably cure the affixing of an improper seal.

On the 29th of September 1807, George Molson and wife conveyed these same lands to Sarah Molson, and John Hart and Aaron Boker as her trustees, for the consideration of $10. This is the same in law as a reconveyance to herself. If you are satisfied that the sale by Sarah Molson to George Molson was under the understanding and arrangement that he was to receive the land for her use, and reconvey the same to her, or to trustees for her benefit, it was fraudulent and void as to the creditors of Daniel Williams, and the legatees of his will.

And with us the judge trying the cause in which the fact is needed may ascertain the official default on sufficient evidence, and treat the fact as if it had been duly recorded.

Then we must treat it as found; and the fact that it does not state in which court the acknowledgment took place, is supplied by the fact appearing in the entry that it is a continuation of the record of the same suit; by the presumption in favour of the regularity of the proceeding; and by the additional fact that none but the Circuit Court was in session on that day.

It is not as a judgment that it is a lien at all; but as a debt established by judgment, it claimed a right to resort to any land of the decedent for payment. The <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>Act of 1794 forbids this in ordinary cases, and therefore the will is resorted to, as giving the law of the case by making the land a trust fund, without limitation of time, for the payment of all the debts. Is this so ?</p>
    <p id="b294-6" data-blocks='[["BL_294.4",294,[293,565,1164,469]]]'>It is true that it was decided in Alexander <em>v. </em>McMurray, <a href="/watts/8/0504-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Watts 504" data-case-ids="1848506" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0504-01">8 Watts 504</a>, that where executors are directed by will to sell land for the payment of debts, this creates a trust of the land for that purpose, and the limitation in the Act of 1794 does not apply; and this case is followed by others: <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20522" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Watts 522">9 Watts 522</a>; 3 Harris 111. But these eases were qualified in Eetterman <em>v. </em>Agnew, 4 Barr 63, where it is said that “ these were not cases of trust, but of charge, in which the temporary charge imposed by the law was supplanted by the permanent charge imposed by the testator.” And it is there shown that such a devise adds nothing to the power of the executors.</p>
    <p id="b294-7" data-blocks='[["BL_294.5",294,[293,1036,1163,728]]]'>By the English common law, general creditors could not reach the land, even though so devised; but, for the purpose of formulating his jurisdiction, a chancellor would treat the devise as creating a trust for creditors, and would compel a sale in order to pay.them. I rather think, however, that he would respect a statute that fixed a time for the presentation and pursuit of such debts, and would not entertain a bill coming after that period. He usually judges thus, and perhaps he would thus treat a clause so purely formal as this, which can hardly be supposed to be intended to keep open the settlement of a testator’s estate, and the sale of his land, or its safe enjoyment, by his devisees or heirs for an indefinite period: 6 Barr 268. In Agnew <em>v. </em>Eetterman, it is said that such a clause as this has no other effect than to save the necessity of applying to the Orphans’ Court for an order of sale. If this be so, the power of sale would be gone when the statute bars the debts as against the land, unless the will expressly excludes the bar of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b294-8" data-blocks='[["BL_294.6",294,[296,1765,1162,460]]]'>But, however this may be, there is another element in this case. This is not <em>simply </em>a devise to sell for the payment of debts, but it says of the sale, “ the moneys arising therefrom to be applied to pay debts and legacies <em>above;" </em>and above the testator had said that all just demands brought to his executors “ in due and lawful time,” should be paid. This clause relating to time may possibly be regarded as merely formal; but certainly it is no more so than the trust clause, so called; and if this may be valid to create a charge which the law created without it, that ought to be valid to limit the charge, as it was limited by the law.</p>
    <p id="b294-9" data-blocks='[["BL_294.7",294,[284,2236,1177,170]],["BL_295.1",295,[261,384,1166,164]]]'>Surely, this clause is sufficient to show that the testator did not intend to supplant the temporary charge of the law by a 'permanent one of his own creation, for he refers to the “lawful time;” and moreover, that is not mere formal language. He <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>may not have known or thought of any special legal limitation; but his language shows that he was willing to trust to the law for a proper one. He dedicated his land for his debts just as the law dedicated it.</p>
    <p id="b295-6" data-blocks='[["BL_295.4",295,[263,556,1184,259]]]'>We think, therefore, that the devise does not reject but retains the limitation in the Act of 1794 (repeated in 1797), and that this debt had ceased to be a lien or charge on the land at the ' time of the first effective process for its recovery, and consequently that the sale under the judgment passed no title to the purchaser.</p>
    <p id="b295-7" data-blocks='[["BL_295.5",295,[265,814,1166,216]]]'>This shows that the plaintiffs below have no title under that proceeding, and are therefore not entitled to present a charge of fraud against any link in the title now held by the defendants, and we need not discuss that point in the case.
