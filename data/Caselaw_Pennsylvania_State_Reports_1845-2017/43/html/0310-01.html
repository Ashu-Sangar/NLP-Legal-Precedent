For several years John D. Hopper had taken charge of their property, and sawed their lumber at a fixed price per thousand feet, he paying the employees at the <a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>mill. The Messrs. White were also the owners of a shingle machine and necessary fixtures for the manufacture of sawed shingles. On the 7th day of July 1859, they leased to Hopper the shingle machine and fixtures, with the privilege of erecting, at his own expense, a building suitable to contain them. The agreement was in these words :—</p>

Hopper erect, at his own. expense, a building, suitable to place therein the shingle machine and fixtures connected therewith, belonging to the said J. and H.

White the sum of one dollar for each and every thousand of No. 1 and No. 2 shingles so manufactured; said Hopper to have the right to use said mill in manufacturing the two millions until April 1, A.

The building erected for the shingle machine was located on land of the Whites, which they had not leased, but which was in their exclusive possession ; the machine belonged to them, and was to be driven by the water-power of their dam; the castings for gearing the machine, and the lumber for the erection of the building, were furnished by them, and both building and machine were to be restored to them in good order, whenever Hopper had manufactured two millions of shingles out of their timber, for which he was to pay them at the rate of one dollar per thousand of the shingles manufactured. And his rights to use the mill for this purpose were to terminate on the 1st April 1861, or sooner, if sooner than that date he should complete the manufacture of his two millions of shingles. Hop<a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>per was, at the time, carrying on the saw-mill of the Whites, not as their lessee, but as their hired sawyer.</p>
    <p id="b313-5" data-blocks='[["BL_313.4",313,[255,472,1170,462]]]'>Who can fail to see that the erection of the building was to be paid for by the use of the machine to make two millions of shingles, and that this was the whole scope and intent of the agreement ? It was as if they had said to Hopper, “ erect a house for our shingle machine, and you shall have the use of it to make two millions of shingles.” That was the mode of compensation agreed on by the parties for a specific work. But the building was as exclusively the property of the Whites as if any other mode of compensating their architect had been agreed upon. It was therefore exposed to the ordinary liability of mechanics’ liens.</p>
    <p id="b313-6" data-blocks='[["BL_313.5",313,[917,945,458,42]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
