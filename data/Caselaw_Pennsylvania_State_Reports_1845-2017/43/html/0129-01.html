Cross brought suit against William W. Wilson, on his official bond, in which they recovered the amount they had paid Milliken, and interest. The case is reported in 1*0 Casey 63.

This is the bond on which judgment was obtained, and $217.20 paid on the judgment by the sheriff to Kirk out of the purchase-money. Consequently McDowell, the purchaser, was erroneously released from the payment of that amount of the purchase-money which he ought to have paid to relieve the land purchased from the lien of the mortgage. [If McDowell never paid this $217.20, but it was erroneously paid by the sheriff out of the purchase-money paid by McDowell, and the receipts on the mortgage and bonds were given in consequence of this payment by the sheriff, a part of which was after-wards repaid to him by Mr. Kirk, then, as to Mr. McDowell, we instruct you that the receipts given, founded in. error and mistake as to this $217.20, will not prevent a recovery of the amount paid by Mr. Kirk by a proceeding on the mortgage.] But it is alleged that Eaton, the vendee of McDowell, stands in the position of a purchaser without notice, and is therefore protected, and no recovery can be had against him as terre-tenant,. If such were the case, then there could be no recovery against the terre-tonant Eaton. [But if he had full notice of this claim, upon the mortgage as soon as Mr. Kirk knew of the contract to purchase, or soon afterwards, before the contract was executed by payment of the purchase-money and delivery of deed, then the land in his hands is bound by the lien of the mortgage, and the plaintiff may recover.]</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b132-6" data-blocks='[["BL_132.4",132,[282,1479,1165,897]]]'>“ The question then arises, what amount is Kirk, the assignee of the mortgage, entitled to recover under the evidence in this case ? When he received the $217.20, it is admitted that the mortgage was fully paid, and he would then have no further claim upon the land bound by it. But this was an erroneous payment, and the sheriff for his protection took a refunding receipt from Mr. Kirk. It therefore necessarily follows that the amount which Kirk had. to refund by reason of his refunding receipt, after he had received the full amount of the mortgage, would be the balance due and recoverable by this proceeding by <em>scire facias </em>on the mortgage. The proof is that the only sums refunded by Kirk to the sheriff was $195.70, the amount of the judgment recovered by Milliken for the use of the Crosses, against sheriff Wilson for the misappropriation, which judgment was rendered the 5th of September 1859, and also the sum of $10 paid by Kirk to the sheriff the 8th of February 1860, in a suggestion of Samuel and William Cross, as plaintiffs in the suit on the sheriff’s bond, in which they claimed an overplus, after payment of all the liens, payable out of the purchase-money. Those two sums, with interest from the dates mentioned, would be the amount which the plaintiff would be entitled to recover.</p>

He alleges that the judgment of Endslow for use of Kirk <em>v. </em>William and Samuel Cross, which was a lien, and would have been paid out of the sheriff’s sales had the money been legally appropriated, was not paid to him, and he thus loses the amount of the Endslow judgment, with interest from 1st March 1842, and that he is entitled to recover this amount in addition to the money paid sheriff Wilson. But we do not concur with the plaintiff in this. This is a <em>sci. fa. </em>on the mortgage to recover what is due on it. The evidence shows he received the balance due on the mortgage, of which $217.20 was illegally paid; but if paid, he surely cannot ask to recover it a second time because the first payment was improperly and illegally made to him. He can recover in this case the amount refunded to the sheriff, and no more. If he ought to have received the Endslow judgment, his remedy was by a suggestion in the suit on the sheriff’s bond of the misappropriation in the case of Endslow’s judgment; but he cannot recover in the <em>sci. fa. </em>on the mortgage against the owner of the land for a misappropriation by the sheriff, in not paying a judgment which had'no connection whatever with the mortgage.”</p>
