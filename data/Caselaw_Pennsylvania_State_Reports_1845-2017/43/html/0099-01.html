On the day the note was matured, Tredwell called with it at the banking-house where it was payable. Neither Ross Forward, nor the drawers, had then any money there. The drawers never had. Tredwell was informed that Forward had no money in bank. Mr. Scull, the defendant, •was then informed that Tredwell had been at the bank with a note, and replied that it was his note. On the same day he endorsed the note as follows : “I hereby waive notice of protest for non-payment in this case. E. Scull, October 13th 1859.” Let it be, that a waiver of notice of protest will not excuse the holder from making a "demand, in the face of the undisputed facts in evidence, it was not for the defendant to complain that no sufficient demand had been made. Beyond the direct evidence of an actual demand, there was the fact that the drawers had no funds in the bank. It was with these facts in view, and unquestioned, the judge charged the jury, that under the evidence there was substantially a demand made, and instructed them that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. This instruction was correct. If it was not accurate to make the abstract remark, that a demand is not necessary where there is a waiver of notice of protest, it could have done the plaintiff in error no possible harm.</p>
