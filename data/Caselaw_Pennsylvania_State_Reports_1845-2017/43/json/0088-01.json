Upon the trial of the cause and before verdict, the plaintiffs moved the court for leave to strike from the record the name of William T. Daugherty, as one of the defendants, which motion was denied, and the court charged the jury \u201cthat there being no evidence in this case against William T.

In the exercise of a proper discretion, where the plaintiffs neither made nor alleged any mistake, and where they had acquired a full knowledge of all the facts at the arbitration, we cannot say in this particular case that the court were wrong in refusing the motion, and this is all we intend to decide.\nJudgment affirmed.",

On writ of error, Held, that as no mistake was alleged in making D. a defendant, and as the plaintiffs had knowledge of the facts from the time of the arbitration, the refusal of the court below to permit the amendment was ia the exercise of a proper discretion, and not error.\nError to the Common Pleas of Bedford county.\nThis was an action of assumpsit by Milton, W. Locke and Jacob Snyder, for the use of George F. Steel, against William T. Daugherty and John G. Hartley, to recover a balance of $1300, claimed to be due on a contract for furnishing and laying the plank on the road of the Hopewell and Bloody Run Plank and .Turnpike Company, which it was averred had been built by defendants after the company became insolvent.\nThe case was arbitrated, and an award found against Hartley, from which award he and the plaintiffs appealed.\nOn the trial, after the plaintiff had closed his testimony, it was intimated by the court that there was no evidence of a joint promise, and that the action could not be maintained.\nThe plaintiffs\u2019 counsel thereupon moved the court to amend the record by striking therefrom the name of William T. Daugherty, which was refused.\nThere was a verdict and judgment for defendants; whereupon the case was removed into this court, where the refusal of the court to allow the amendment was assigned for error.\nJohn Cessna, for plaintiff in error,\ncited and relied on tlie Act of 1846, Purd. 38 ; Act of 1852, Id.; Act of 1858, Id.; Horbach v.
