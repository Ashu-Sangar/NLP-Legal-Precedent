It is intended for the benéfit of persons who have purchased parts of the mortgaged property, and are willing to contribute their proper share to have their land released ; that they may not be made liable for the laches, neglect, or inability of others, nor be imposed on by the mortgagee, who might release the terre-tenant, in equity bound to pay the whole, and compel another to pay, who ought not <em>to </em>pay any thing, or at most was bound to contribute only his proper proportion.</p>

      <em>%A </em>mortgagee ought not to be.süf|ilied:'¡to affect the rights of the térre-tenants, by refusing or neglecting to make them parties. It is an entirely mistaken notion of the counsel-that has been urged so vehemently, that the sheriff rausf <em>sell in the lump </em>every thing contained in the mortgage; and that his deed will be of no avail, unless it follows precisely the courses' and distances laid down in the de'eds and writs of <em>scire facias </em>and <em>levari facias. </em>That a whole square. in a city must be sold together, though divided into twenty different tenements, with entire different equities ; and that the court have no power to interfere, either to direct the sheriff to sell. in lots or separate tenements, and in what order to sell them. If such be the case, our courts of justice are without competent authority to administer justice, and may be compelled, by the stringency of a statute, to sit by as the silent spectators, or rather as the coadjutors of the most gross iniquity: and in a course of near thirty years’ experience in our courts of justice, I can say that such has hot been the practice, so. far as it has come to my knowledge. In fact this doctrine has its foundation in the same mistaken notion that was advanced by counsel in the.case of Culp <em>v. </em>Fisher, <a href="/watts/1/0494-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Watts 494" data-case-ids="1838023" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0494-01">1 Watts, 494</a>, viz.: that a mortgage was like a ground-rent, and that the same doctrine applied to both. In that case, Mr. Justice Kennedy says, <em>‘ </em>Defendant’s ' counsel have likened the release of part of the land mortgaged, to the case of rent charged on three .acres of land, where he who has the rent released all his right in one acre. And it is said the reJease extinguishes the whole rent; ánd the reason assigned for it isj because it issues out of every part of the land, and cannot be apportioned. But this cannot be said of money, or a debt charged on land'by a mortgage. For although the whole of the money is charged on every part and parcel .of the land embraced by the mortgage, <em>yet- if the land so mortgaged consists of several tracts or parcels, </em>when the mortgage money comes to be raised by a judicial sale of it, <em>each tract or parcel must </em>be. <em>sold </em>separately; and no more'of it can be sold than shall be found sufficient to raise the money claimed upon the execution..</p>

If the court here' must compel the plaintiff to release, the three acres, before-permitting him to proceed and sell the fourteen acres, it would not only be against law but justice.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b87-3" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[190,648,1204,917]]]'>' Nor would the difficulty be obviated by levying- on the whole, but selling only the fourteen acres. This could not be done. The sale must be co-extensive with the levy. A mortgagee cannot know, nor is he bound to know, the metes, bounds, and dates of the respective divisions or portions. The principle on which the decisions in Nailer’s Executors <em>v. </em>Stanley, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%20455" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="10 Serg. &amp; Rawle 455">10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 455</a>, 456, rests, is entirely different from -the present.- The reason of the .rule there is obvious and just; The debt is a personal one. The debtor always remains liable to pay the debt. A.11 his property must be first taken, -and exhausted. Hence the last purchaser takes with that understanding. But in the case of a mortgage there is no personal debt. Th'e judgment not against the person, but <em>de tends. </em>The land, not the person, pays the debt. As to the equities in this case: the complainant is not an innocent purchaser without notice. He knew of the mortgage. Now he asks the intervention of the equitable powers of this court, to,enable him to evade the payment of any portion of the mortgage; whilst all that we ask, standing in the 'double capacity of purchaser and mortgagor, is, that he be compelled to pay his proportionate part of the mortgage, and we w-ill pay ours.</p>

A similar order was made in the District Court of Philadelphia in Winberg <em>v» </em>Reiff, December Term, 1844, No. 58, which was a <em>sri.fa, </em>on a mortgage and execution issued, under which lots Ños, 1 and <em>2 </em>were sold by the sheriff. Swarthy filed an affidavit stating that the mortgage in suit was the first incumbrance given by Rciff, who was the owner of both lots. That he subsequently, while owner of Nos. 1 and 3r sold No. 1 to Springer, and agreed with the purchaser that No.. <em>2 </em>should pay the mortgage to plaintiff. Springer mortgaged No. 1 to Reifffor the purchase money, which mortgage was held by Swartley. Upon this, the court set aside the sale, and ordered “ plaintiff to proceed to sell house and lot described in sheriff’s advertisement as No. <em>2, </em>before selling No, 1? which is to be sold only in case of No. <em>2 </em>not making debt, interest, and costs,” <em>Ex. </em>Dec., Dec.
