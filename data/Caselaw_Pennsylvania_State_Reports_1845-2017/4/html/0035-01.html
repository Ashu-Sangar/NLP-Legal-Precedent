June, 1843, and ended on the first Monday of June, 1844. The plaintiff proved that John Sampson was treasurer of the school district of Reserve township in 1843, and.up to March, .1844, when he went out,; that the whole'amount of-the school-tax. duplicate for 1844 was $711 75; that-the amount of school-tax paid to Sampson, whilst he was treasurer, was $365 50, the last payment of which was made to him in January, 1844; and that the balance of the duplicate, after deducting lost taxes and commissions of the collector, was paid by th'e <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>collector to Mr. Lowrie and Mr. Wood; but in what capacity they received it, did not appear on the paper-book. The collector for 1844 settled in the latter end of the summer of that year, and paid over the balance. It appeared that the balance in the hands of Mr. Sampson, on the 9th of March, 1844, was $19 31. When the schools commenced in 1843, there were no funds in his hands, as treasurer, and the teachers agreed to wait until the tax was collected. According to the triennial assessment list of 1843, Reserve township, including the borough of Manchester, contained five hundred and four taxable inhabitants. In the spring of 1844, shortly after Manchester was made a separate school district, it contained between one hundred and seventy-five and two hundred taxable inhabitants. A duplicate for Manchester was made out in June, 1844.</p>

The school-house in which this school was kept, was near to Manchester, but in Reserve township. The defendant offered in evidence the minute-book of the school directors of Reserve township for the school year of 1844, for the purpose of accounting for the appropriation and disbursement of the fund collected and received for that school year. This was objected to by the plaintiff; but the court overruled the objection, and admitted the book for the purpose offered. This ruling of the court was plaintiff’s first bill of exception. Minutes of the 9th of November, 1844, were then read, from which it appeared that on a settlement with Lidoo, the collector, the amount collected on the duplicate was ... $625 State appropriation, ------- 382</p>

What is or is not in evidence, can only be determined by the court which tries the issue, and it would be wrong for us to rule in opposition to their decision, that because a party has read part, he is at liberty to read and comment on every sentence and item in the whole book. This will take the opposite party by surprise, and frequently have the effect of preventing him from rebutting or explaining it. For the purpose of saving time, parties sometimes agree that all that is in the book pertinent to the case, may be taken to be in evidence; but in the absence of express consent, it cannot be so considered. If the plaintiff was surprised, he might have asked the court to withdraw a juror,—a request which, no doubt, would have been granted, if the <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>justice of the case had required it.

That all payments and indebtedness of the school treasury for that year, must be examined and charged to that part of the district which has received the same, or for which the debt was contracted.

The resolution speaks “ of all moneys to which such old district was <em>entitled </em>and <em>received </em>under the several provisions of the common-school law of the Commonwealth for any year or years previous to such provision.” Nevertheless, we cannot believe it was the intention of the legislature to go beyond the current year except where (as the construction satisfies the words as well as the spirit of the resolution) some of the taxes for previous years may be in arrears. We are averse to extending the period, because the investigation of the accounts, from the commencement of the school-district system, would be apt <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>to engender litigation and strife, and an expense frequently more than the amount in controversy was worth. When the taxes remain uncollected, we agree, the new district is entitled to participate in the fund for whatever years the taxes may have been assessed. Cases may be readily supposed, where the construction contended for by plaintiff would lead to injustice. Thus, where there are two or more school districts in a township afterwards divided, one may, immediately before the division, receive all to which they are entitled, the other none: would it not'be unjust, that the receiving district should, notwithstanding, be entitled to share the remainder of the funds merely because it reached the treasury at or immediately before the division, and, consequently, was in the treasury at the time. Such a rule is not to be desired, as it would frequently by management be made to operate very adversely to the interest of the new district.</p>
