A writ of error was sued out by the defendants therein, which was quashed for want of a judgment on the verdict. The present application was for an alternative mandamus .to the judges of that court, to compel the entry of a judgment, which had been refused by the court, for the reasons and judgment in Baker <em>v. </em>Williamson, 2 Barr, 116.</p>

We did not mean to dispute it, but to show this is not a case for the exercise of the discretion given by by the statute. Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Judges, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0272-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 272" data-case-ids="478038" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0272-01">5 Watts &amp; Serg. 272</a>. [Rogers, J.—If you establish that the court is a Court of Chancery, the other proposition follows of course, for the practice is settled not to enter a judgment on such an issue.] We submit, there must be a failure of justice to authorize this remedy, whereas an appeal from the decree of the court, ordering the sale on the final decree, is the proper remedy. It is erroneous to say judgment is tobe entered for costs; the course is to apply for ah attachment to the court directing the issue. The endless litigation to be produced by the proposed course, is a strong argument against the right, as it must come up on final decree if either party is dissatisfied.</p>

Our Orphans’ Court is essentially such in its proceedings .and decrees, within the limited sphere of its jurisdiction. Where trial by jury is of right, as it is in the case of a contested will, and in certain money cases, the writ of error is also of right-; not- so in regard to -an issue formed for the information of the chancellor,' who may, after all, disregard *the verdict. It would be not only useless but inconvenient, to have the. regularity’of the trial inspected by anyone else: useless because he would not be bound by the event; and inconvenient, because it would produce interminable delay. We are of opinion, therefore, that no judgment should be rendered, and th.at the return to the mandamus is sufficient.</p>
