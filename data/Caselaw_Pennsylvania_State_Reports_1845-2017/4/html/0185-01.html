But the evidence offered was-not within the scope or authority of either the agent, Eddy, or the president of the company. What authority had Eddy to bind the company whether they would insure in one place or another ? Whether they would insure in town or country? His duty was to receive applications and pre-. miums, and beyond that he had no power to bind the company. ■Nor was the declaration of the president, when he appointed Eddy, within the scope of his duties. The board of directors decided where they would insure. A large portion of the insurances within the city of Pittsburgh were made after the plaintiff in error'became a corporation and one of the company.</p>
