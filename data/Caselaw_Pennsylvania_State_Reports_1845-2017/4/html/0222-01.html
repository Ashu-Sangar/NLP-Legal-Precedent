Claims for services about the estate generally, which were disallowed, having been rejected by the auditor, on the account stated- above in the Orphans’ Court. 3. For taxes and expenses about the lands (the proceeds of which were now for distribution) which were disallowed, as having no reference to the trust estate. The master reported that defendant was indebt-ed to the estate in $1884 14. On the 20th June, 1844, a decree was made absolute, confirming the report. The certificate to this «report” was dated about eleven months after the reference to the auditor in the present proceeding. The auditor allowed George W. Carpenter, one of the appellants, a.part of his claim. What the claim was, does not appear from the paper-book. He allowed Miles Carpenter his claim, which wTas said to be too great, and divided the residue equally among the nine children, stating « no evidence was brought before the auditor, conclusive that said sum should not be equally divided among them.” The exceptions were to the allowance and disallowance of the claims of George and Miles, and in refusing to set off the claims against Charles and Miles respectively.</p>

Carpenter. Nor can we say he was wrong in rejecting part of the claim of George W. Carpenter, for money alleged to have been expended for the estate. So far as regards these items, the decree is affirmed. <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>But it is alleged there is error in refusing to allow the claims of the estate of Miles- N. Carpenter, and Charles Carpenter, or in other words, to set off the indebtedness of said heirs to the estate, against their shares of the funds in the hands of the trustee. It was alleged that several of the heirs, and among others, Miles and Charles, were advanced in the lifetime of their father, an amount equal to, if not greater, than their share of the estate. - This appears by a certified record of the Orphans’ Court of the city and county of Philadelphia, showing an advancement to said Miles and Charles. The auditors decided, that as no testimony was brought before them, <em>conclusive </em>that said sum was advanced, it should be disallowed, and the fund equally divided among all the heirs. We understand the reason of this otherwise unaccountable decision to have been, that the record, when before the auditors, was not duly certified, but before the decree of the court it was certified in due and proper form. Now, although the decree may not be conclusive evidence of an advancement, yet it is <em>prima facie </em>evidence, it being a decree of a court of competent jurisdiction between the same parties, and on the same subject matter. As, however, there is some difficulty in understanding the case, we decree that it be referred back to the same auditors, with directions to report the facts to the next term of this court, taking other testimony either by deposition or otherwise, tending to show whether'the said Miles and Charles, or the other children, were or were not advanced in the lifetime of their father, Conrad Carpenter.</p>
