      <em>Sept. </em>30. The facts of this case are stated in the opinion of this court.. It may be proper to add, that the certificate of the surveyor-general was, “ that from an examination of the books of the land-office, it does not appear that patents have issued by the Commonwealth, for in-lots in the town of. Warren, Nos. 486 and 487, &amp;c., sold by the commissioners of sales to Ephraim Morrison, two-thirds of the purchase money not being paid,” and was under the seal of the land-office. • The evidence of Judge Hackney having been commissioner, was parol testimony that he acted in that capacity.</p>

This is the first error assigned. It has been the constant and universal usage of the courts in Pennsylvania to receive in evidence the certificates of the officers of the land-office, that no. warrant or survey, return of survey, or no patent has issued, nor can be found in their officé.' It is not true that a negative certificate is always rejected. It may be <em>prima facie </em>evidence for many purposes. A negative certificate of a recorder, that a deed cannot be found, is received in evidence as part of the proof made, to let in secondary evidence of the contents.
