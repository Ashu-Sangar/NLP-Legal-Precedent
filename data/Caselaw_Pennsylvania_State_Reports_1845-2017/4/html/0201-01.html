The plaintiffs in this ejectment claimed title to one-half -"of a donation tract a.s acquired by the statute- of limitations under an entry-by Reigle,-their father, in 1806, and possession continued for upwards of twenty-one years. .'The defendants had the title of <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>the original owner of the tract, and obtained possession by agreement with the. widow of Reigle and her second husband in 1833. The question was, whether there had been an adverse possession by Reigle, who with one Shingledecker entered on the whole tract in 1806, and occupied it jointly until 1815 or 1816, when a partition was made. After Reigle had been in possession some time, the evidence of the plaintiff showed that he claimed the land as his own, and paid the taxes until his death, in 1825, when his widow continued in possession until the sale by her to the defendant, mentioned above. To show the character of the possession, plaintiffs read the deposition of Shingledecker, who stated, “We intended to leave when the real owner, with a good deed, that is, the old soldier, who had a good deed, should come for it, but not till then. We settled it to hold it until a better owner came for it, and then to give it up,”</p>

This witness was in the same situation as Reigle, the owners of neither tract being then known. Another witness stated that he was employed by Reigle a few years before his death, to make rails, and was refused permission to use the green timber, Reigle giving as a reason that the land was not his own, and he might be put to trouble • by the owner for destroying' the <em>timber, </em>and that he had frequently heard 'Reigle say he wished to purchase the land from the owner when he came.</p>

In the former’ case, nothing short of an agreement to hold under, or what is tantamount to an acknowledgment of title, will prevail; but in the latter, the character of the entry must be ascertained from all the evidence,' and the previous and accompanying declarations may be relied on by the jury.</p>

Hence there could be no other evidence of .the <em>quo animo </em>of the entry than the declarations of Reigle to third persons. Therefore the question results in this—can there be an entry under, or subject to an unknown owner? That such a possession can be taken, is established by the case of Jones <em>v. </em>Porter, 3 Penna. Rep. 135 ; Criswell <em>v. </em>Altemiis, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20581" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts 581">7 Watts, 581</a> ;• Sailor <em>v. </em>Hertzogg, 2 Barr, 184,185.

Not so with ’one. who enters on a drawn donation tract, knowing it to be such. He cannot hope to obtain title by settlement—nothing short of twenty-one years’ possession- can avail. <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>Therefore the fact that an entry was or was not made to obtain title by settlement, under the act of 1792, has a material bearing on the question of the <em>quo animo </em>of the entry. The case of Bank <em>v. </em>Wilson is that of a settler under the act of 1792. Hence the strong, language used in that decision is not applicable to the case of a donation tract. But the court instead of submitting the queslion of intention in the entry to the jury, shut the door to that inquiry, by saying that nothing short of an agreement would prevent the operation of the statute of limitations.</p>

It has been held that possession, taken by mistake, and continued with no view to acquire title by it, is not adverse, because not hostile. It may therefore well be, as was said in Criswell <em>v. </em>Altemus, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20581" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="7 Watts 581">7 Watts, 581</a>, though it was not exactly the point decided, that it is sufficient to prevent the possession from being adverse, that the party taking it intends to hold subject to the will of the owner. It has been determined that one already in possession estops himself by declarations of submission addressed to the owner; and it would seem he might do so by a general declaration explanatory of the nature of his entry. But there is a presumption which lasts till it is rebutted, that an intruder enters to hold for himself; and it is not to be doubted that a trespasser entering to gain a title, though conscious that he is a wrongdoer, will accomplish his object, if the owner do not enter or prosecute his claim within the prescribed period. But to do so, it is necessary that his possession be adverse from the first; and to infer that he intended it to be otherwise, would impute to him an inconsistency of purpose. Was there evidence to rebut the presumption that the entry and possession of Reigle and Shingledecker were adverse to the title ? No declaration by them was inconsistent with an intention to hold the land as long as they could, or evincive of a design to give it up before they should be compelled to do so by the appearance of a claimant whom they could not resist. They were conscious they had no title themselves, and they said so ; they were conscious they could not resist him who had it, and they said so ; but they did not say that they meant not to acquire a title to it for themselves. Whatever they did say, was predicated on the expected appearance of the owner <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>while he continued to be so ; for they certainly did not mean to purchase the land from any one else. Shingledecker himself testified that he and Reigle settled on the land “ to hold it till a better owner came for it;” but the holder of the title would lose it, and cease to be the better owner at the end of one-and-twenty years. They intended to hold adversely to all the world till the title should' be produced to them, and consequently as adversely to the owner 'before he disclosed himself as to any one' else. The sum of the evidence is that they entered to hold the land as long as they could; and they consequently gained the title to it by the statute of limitations. Judgment affirmed.</p>
