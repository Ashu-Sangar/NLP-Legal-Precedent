That plaintiffs, as attorneys, in order to obtain a fraudulent preference over the other creditors, at and before the execution of said deed, made another agreement with Motz and defendant without the knowledge of the other creditors, whereby, to induce the signing of the composition-deed, defendant and Motz agreed to give notes for the residue of the debt of January &amp; Son to plaintiffs, in pursuance of which, the note in suit was executed.</p>

The deed was without <em>date—there was some evidence </em>its execution was completed in November, 1841. It declared a mutual agreement; that the creditors, on request from Warner &amp; Beehler, and “on payment by them of such a sum as together with the dividend to be received (by the creditors) under assignments by C. E., and C. E. &amp; Co., will make up a sum equal to fifty per cent, of their respective debts, with accruing interest, or if no dividend shall have been paid, then on payment of fifty per cent, of their debts, will transfer unto WTarner &amp; Beehler the claims and debts due or accruing by E. &amp; Co. (to the creditors,) and all evidences of debts held therefore.” Warner &amp; Beehler agreed, on receiving such transfer, to pay the amount required to make up the fifty per cent, so soon as it should be settled that the preferred creditors named in the assignments, (they and five others were preferred,) were alone entitled to claim thereunder; if no dividend was paid, then they agreed to pay the fifty per cent.

The debt, if so it might be called, was incurred by the fraud of the factor, for which he might have been proceeded against criminally, and the note in question was given by the party to that fraud, who now seeks to discharge himself from a debt which he himself styles sacred. There is a marked distinction in the cases founded on this circumstance. Small <em>v. </em>Brackley, <em>2 </em>Vern. 602, where it is said a fraudulent debtor is not relieved from an underhand agreement. The doctrine having been imported from equity into the law, brings with it all equitable exceptions to the rule. [Gibson, C.

[Rogers, J.—The jury have found the note was not given for that particular tobacco.] The judge left it to them to say whether that claim was compromised by the deed.

They, and the partners of Esenwein &amp; Co., were the only persons interested, and on whom this alleged fraud could operate, and they had full notice of the whole transaction—were, in fact, parties to the arrangement. In addition to this, all the other creditors had made their arrangements before January &amp; Son had stipulated to become parties; the two principles, therefore, on which this rule is founded, that there is to be a mutual loss, and that'no deceit must be practised on the other parties, are entirely wanting.

The deed of composition and parol evidence being given in evidence to sustain the defendant’s plea, the judge charged the jury, and to this charge the plaintiffs have assigned several errors. The only one material to consider is, that the judge charged the jury that the agreement between Warner &amp; Beehler and the creditors of Esenwein &amp; Co., dated in 1841, was in the nature of a deed of composition between insolvent debtors and their creditors. When we look at the written agreement and the parol evidence, we all think it was impossible for the court to view it in any other light. The agreement was clearly a deed of composition, and the parol evidence, if believed by the jury, showed, instead of a part payment of the debt due by Esenwein &amp; Co. to <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>J. M. January &amp; Son, as contended by the plaintiff’s counsel, the signature of the attorneys of J. M. January &amp; Son was given upon the consideration of the further remuneration than the fifty per <em>cent </em>secured by Warner &amp; Beehler. Mr. Patterson refused to sign the agreement, unless he received these notes. The evidence is clear against the construction, that the note in .question was given in part payment of the plaintiff’s demand, before the deed between Warner &amp; Beehler and the creditors was executed. To me it appears that the learned judge put the case most fairly to the jury. He instructed them that if they found that the note in question was given in part payment of the debt of Esenwein &amp; Co., without reference to the agreement of composition between Esenwein &amp; Co. and their creditors, and not as an inducement to January &amp; Son to sign the deed between Warner &amp; Beehler and the creditors, then the plaintiff may recover upon it. To us it appears that the charge was as favourable to the plaintiffs as the law would warrant on the evidence. The principle adduced from the adjudged cases on this subject is, entire good faith, which the creditors have a right to expect from each other, and from the debtor. There is to be no collusion between the debtor and the favoured creditor, and each creditor is to stand on the same footing. 11 A. &amp; El. 1039, (39 E. C. L. R.) But it is contended that the attorneys of January &amp; Son were the last to sign, and that their signing could not have induced others to come into the agreement. This argument is unsound. It was held in Steinman and others <em>v. </em>Magnus, 11 East, 390, that where a debtor entered into an agreement with his creditors, whereby they recovered twenty per cent, in satisfaction of their several demands, and released the remainder in consideration that half of the composition should be secured by the acceptance of a certain person, (also a creditor,) which security was accordingly given and paid when due ; such agreement was held to be binding on the plaintiff, one of the creditors, though the agreement was not under seal, and though he was the last who signed it, and it did not appear that he had actually induced any of the other creditors to sign it, and that the plaintiffs suing the debtor after having received the composition was a fraud upon the security and the other creditors. The law was held by Lord Kenyon, Buller, and others, that where the creditors of an insolvent consent to accept a composition for their respective demands upon an assignment of his effects by a deed of trust, to which they are all parties, and one of them, before he executes, obtain from the insolvent a promissory note for the residue of this demand, by refusing to execute till such note be made, the note is void in law as a <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>fraud on the rest of the creditors, and a subsequent promise to pay it, is a promise without consideration, which will not maintain an action. <em>2 </em>Term Rep. 763. The judge would havé erred if he had charged otherwise. He put the case fairly to the jury.</p>
