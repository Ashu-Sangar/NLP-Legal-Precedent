      <em>Oct. </em>20. The defendant in error brought ejectment for a lot numbered twenty, in the Warren Reserve. The only evidence on the paper-book was a copy, of the drafts, surveys of the plaintiff and defendants, and the patent of the latter. The survey of the plaintiff was made on the 28th September, 1799, in pursuance of the act of April 11, 1779, for selling certain reserved tracts, and of the order of the governor of May 14,1799, and that of the surveyor-general on the 18th of the same month. The draft, or plan, returned by the deputy surveyor is here given. The defendants’ survey was made on the 13th February, 1834, and their patent dated September 5, 1836. Their land is included within the dotted lines. On the plan of the plaintiff, as returned, it will be observed, the Warren town lots are marked as their boundary. The plaintiff’s survey contained ninety-four acres, thirty-six perches. The defendants’, fifteen acres, one hundred and fifty-four perches.</p>

The survey of No. 20, on. the side next the town, called for four courses. Of the five courses called for on that side, two were white oak, and oné hickory, and two posts, and there-was, evidence, from which a jury could hardly doubt but that these four courses were actually run and marked for reserved tract No. 20. •</p>
    <p id="b247-4" data-blocks='[["BL_247.4",247,[233,831,1186,1112]]]'>But the judge took the case from the jury, and instructed them that the plaintiff had a good title in law to the part in dispute; that there was no vacancy, because the survey of No. 20 called for the town lots. In this there was manifest error. It has ever been held that the marks on the ground constitute the survey; that the courses and distances are only evidence of the survey. This is found in every reported case in our books. In more than one case, it is said, the law is so <em>settled </em>for ever. I need only refer to Walker <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 Barr, 43, w’here the subject is fully considered, and the authorities collected. I know of but one case, Martz <em>v. </em>Hartley, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20262" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="4 Watts 262">4 Watts, 262</a>, where there is an unfortunate dictum that the case did not warrant, that has misled more than one president judge, and carried several lawsuits. That dictum has been fully remarked on in 2 Barr, before cited, and I need not again review it. Mageehan and Adams, Walker and Smith, as well as other cases, settled, that when a surveyor, in the execution of a warrant, run and actually marked the lines on the ground, and returned by these lines, and then called for an old line or an old surve}^ as adjoining, the owner could not extend his title to the survey called for. He was bound by the survey on the ground. Instead of it being a question of law, it was a question of fact for the jury, under the whole evidence, whether the original survey and return of reserved tract No. 20 included any of the land within the survey and patent of the defendants.</p>

There is no doubt the act of the legislature did so contemplate. In that the act is only directory. Is the Commonwealth to be cheated out of her vacant land, either by the ignorance, carelessness, or fraud of her agent ? Tanner has title to his survey No. 20. Beyond the lines of that survey, run on the ground, he has no title. If his survey had not been run and marked on the ground on the side next to the town of Warren, and his return-draft called for the <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>town lots, he would have gone' to the call; but be is estopped by a rule of- property, which can never be departed from, going beyond his return-draft, when the lines of that draft have been marked and run on the ground.</p>
    <p id="b248-3" data-blocks='[["BL_248.4",248,[574,574,880,43]]]'>Judgment reversed, and a <em>venire de novo </em>awarded.</p>
