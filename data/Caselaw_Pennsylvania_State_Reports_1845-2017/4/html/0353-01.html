      <em>Dec. </em>29, 30. Ejectment for a moiety of a hundred and seventeen perches of land. In 1808, Michael Swartz devised the premises to his wife for life, remainder to Thomas Swartz, the defendant below, in fee. In 1813, Michael G. Weisel, jun., purchased from Michael Weisel three acres and three perches of land adjoining this land, together with the privilege of damming a creek so far as the same passes through the premises of Michael Weisel, and, also, the privilege of building and repairing a dam across said creek, so far as may be <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>beneficial to mill or mills intended to be erected on or near adjoining the thereby granted premises. In 1821, he made a general assignment for the benefit of his creditors, and his assignees, in the same year, advertised this tract as a house and lot, and the right in a saw-mill, and conveyed the land, with its appurtenances, to Nicholas Swartz, the plaintiff below, «being the same property which Michael Weisel conveyed to Michael G. Weisel, jun.” Michael G. Weisel was examined by plaintiff, and stated, there was i parol agreement for the joint erection of a new mill, he furnishing the power, and Thomas the scite for the mill and mill yard, the profits to be equally divided, and that there was no limitation as to time, when the agreement was made.'</p>

He also proved admissions by the defendant, that the mill work and repairs were done in partnership.

    <p class="summary" id="b355-5" data-blocks='[["BL_355.5",355,[199,796,1190,1650]]]'>His honour, Krause, P.'J., instructed the jury, “that if they believe that Weisel, in 1813, had thé scite for the dam, and what was selected as the scite for the mill and the creek stood on land adjoining, of which Thomas Swartz had the remainder in fee, thus making both lots necessary to locate a mill power; that these parties then united their advantages for their mutual benefit and profit, took a common possession and built the saw-mill at their joint cost, these facts prove a contract between the parties for an exchange of land which is binding in law; and the sale by WeisePs assignees to the plaintiff, if such was made, in 1821, of WeisePs three acres and three perches with the appurtenances, makes him the owner of an undivided half part of the hundred and seventeen perches, for the purposes stated of said water right and saw-mill, and the plaintiff would be entitled to recover under the authority of Hall <em>v. </em>Benner, 1 Penna. Rep. 402. For a parol contract of the kind, though it must be such as may be executed on comprehensible terms, may be proved by circumstances and the acts of the parties; and an exchange of such advantages to constitute a water-power and mill is a valuable consideration, and possession a sufficient past performance to sustain a parol sale of land. Here, however, if the evidence is believed, there was not only possession taken, but an expenditure of money superadded; and as to Thomas Swartz’s title, a grant from his mother—she living in sight—would be presumed if the justice of the case required it. At any rate, his acquiring the title in full after-wards, would enure to the benefit of the plaintiff as purchaser of WeisePs interest. The jury however will be careful on this branch of the case, to take into view the testimony, that Weisel said there were no articles between himself and Thomas; that they would build and run the mill together, and when it was worn out, they would be rich enough or broke up; that they built on sufferance, and that they had a right only for twenty years. For to enable the plaintiff to recover, he must prove a contract, otherwise there is none for him to execute, and that must be for a period of more than twenty years, otherwise his right of possession had expired when he was ousted.</p>

      <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>“ But the plaintiff also relies on another ground, as to which no such declarations as are proved on the part of Weisel are proved in respect of the plaintiff. If the evidence is believed, Thomas became owner of the full fee in. 1834, of the hundred and seventeen perches, the life-tenant being dead. The plaintiff was owner of the adjoining lot of three acres and three perches. The Commonwealth had reconstructed the dam covering both with water when full. They bought the frame together—used the mill together—built together— paid repairs of the property—the property so situated that neither had a mill property ; they united and made one' by the expenditure of mutual labour and money, and used it as a common property till 1844, when the plaintiff was ousted. Both had possession and use of the premises. If these are facts in the case, they prove a contract supported by a valuable consideration and accompanied by possession, sufficient in law to make the plaintiff owner in common with the defendant, and entitle him to be restored to possession. <a href="/watts-serg/3/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 56" data-case-ids="1854674" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0056-01">3 Watts &amp; Serg. 56</a> ; <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2068" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 68">8 Watts &amp; Serg. 68</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20342" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Watts 342">6 Watts, 342</a>. According to the authority last cited, if the plaintiff built the mill and dam, and Thomas gave him aid and encouragement to expend his money to do so, equity would give him title even without an express contract, and the law is the same when the parties built in common for their mutual advantage on one another’s land as is alleged in this case. The plaintiff, however, insists that the circumstances prove a contract, an expenditure of money and possession in pursuance of it. The jury will take them all into consideration, as shown in the testimony from 1813 to 1844, and under the law as stated make up their verdict.”</p>

Neither is it necessary to examine, in detail, exceptions to dislocated parts of the charge. It would not be more troublesome than unprofitable to follow out to their results these mincing assignments of error, -which, catching at particular expressions, lead to no sound conclusion as to the accuracy of the whole. The <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>proper inquiry is, whether the ruling principle of the cause has been correctly stated and applied to the evidence. To determine whether it has been so stated and applied in this instance, it is necessary to recur to the features of the case. The original parlies to the agreement which is the subject of adjudication, were proprietors of contiguous pieces of land, through which runs a stream of water with just fall enough in its course through both, to afford sufficient power for a saw-mill. The proprietors of these two pieces agreed to erect, in partnership, such a mill on the lower one; the one party finding the scite, the other the water-power, and both contributing equally to the expense. The mill was erected on these terms, and worked for some time on joint account; but the plaintiff below, who purchased the land owned by the proprietor of the water-power, has been held out of a participation in the business and profits, by the proprietor of the scite; and it has been urged on his part, that as the predecessor of the plaintiff below was in possession under a previous arrangement, which had expired by its own limitation, this new parol agreement is void by the statute of frauds.</p>
    <p id="b358-3" data-blocks='[["BL_358.4",358,[328,1288,1179,1157]],["BL_359.1",359,[178,437,1188,667]]]'>One. fallacy of the argument, is the assumption of a right to treat the agreement as a parol conveyance of an interest or estate in the land, instead of a <em>license </em>to use it in a particular way without disturbing the title of the owner as a trustee. That such a license is binding, without part execution by delivery of possession, is shown by Rerick <em>v. </em>Kern, <a href="/serg-rawl/14/0267-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="14 Serg. &amp; Rawle 267" data-case-ids="8878406" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/14/0267-01">14 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 267</a>, on which a parol license to divert water from its ancient course for the use of a saw-mill, was held to be irrevocable after an expenditure of labour or money on the basis of it. The principle of the case is; that the revocation would be a fraud; and that to prevent it, a chancellor will turn the owner of the soil into a trustee <em>ex malefecio. </em>It is in substance the same which postpones the title of one who is studiously silent as to the existence of it, in the presence of a purchaser from a third person ; or of one who suffers another to build ignorantly on his ground without informing him of his mistake. In the case of Jack <em>v. </em>Blair, (not reported,) a co-tenant of a lot in the town of Armstrong was allowed to recover his interest from another who had built an expensive house on it without having had formal notice to desist, only because the defendant had been perfectly aware of the plaintiff’s title. So far was the principle carried in Robinson <em>v. </em>Justice, 2 Penna. Rep. 19, that a title, of whose existence the owner of it was ignorant at the time, was postponed, because his positive representations had induced the vendee to purchase. In the case before us, there was neither want of notice nor want of knowledge; but the plain<a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>tiff’s predecessor in the ownership of the title had been induced by the defendant to expend his money on the faith of the arrangement; and the attempt of the latter to disavow it, is an attempt to commit such a fraud as would induce a chancellor to declare him a trustee, even were the creation of a parol declaration of trust positively prohibited. But that it is not, was ruled in German <em>v. </em>Gabbald, <a href="/binn/3/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="3 Binn. 302" data-case-ids="1791092" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0302-01">3 Binn. 302</a>; Wallace <em>v. </em>Duffield, <a href="/serg-rawl/2/0521-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2 Serg. &amp; Rawle 521" data-case-ids="1798244" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/2/0521-01">2 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 521</a>; Peebles <em>v. </em>Reading, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%20492" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="8 Serg. &amp; Rawle 492">8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 492</a>; Slaymaker <em>v. </em>St. John, <a href="/watts/5/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="5 Watts 27" data-case-ids="1844060" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0027-01">5 Watts, 27</a>, and particularly Martin <em>v. </em>McCord, Ibid. 493, in which it was held, that the gift of a lot for a school-house to be erected by contribution, created a trust for the purpose of the contributors.
