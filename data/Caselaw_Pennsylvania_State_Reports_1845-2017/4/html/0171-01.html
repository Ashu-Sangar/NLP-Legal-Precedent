    <p id="b172-5" data-blocks='[["BL_172.9",172,[324,1578,1180,430]]]'>It has been the custom in Pennsylvania, from a very early period, to make sales of this kind without a contract in writing, signed by the administrator and purchaser, and without any other evidence of the sale in writing than the return of the administrator to the order of sale, and the confirmation by the court. A written contract between the administrator and the purchaser would be without value before the sale was confirmed, and totally useless when it was confirmed. The statute was not designed to operate on judicial sales, but upon contracts in the current of business, and sales between individuals.</p>
