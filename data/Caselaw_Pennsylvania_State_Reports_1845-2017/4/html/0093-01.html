Here the court, acting as a court.of equity, have reformed the deed of trust in a most essential'particular on a naked, unsupported declaration of the husband and wife, wdthout the shadow of proof being, required; nay, ‘the bill on which’ the decree is based, containing an acknowledgment that'no such proof •can be obtained. Such.a decree; in determining the right and title to the premises, is entitled to but little consideration. . - Her rights, and the title of her children, cannot.be impaired by it; and must eventually rest upon' the deed as it originally stood ; which, as we have seen, confers no power to dispose of the estate by deed, but by will, or an appointment in the nature of a will.</p>
    <p id="ATr" data-blocks='[["BL_99.4",99,[216,1931,1201,531]],["BL_100.1",100,[313,417,1182,1062]]]'>Another objection is urged against the. decree, which is equally fatal. The deed of trust, be it remarked, is in the nature of a settle-in'ent. That is the plain intention of the parties, and whether it be an anti or post-nuptial settlement, matters not.'. It cannot with any propriety-be said to b.e in fraud of the husband’s marital rights. It was not concealed from him, but, as appears from the bill in Ghancery, was'executed "with his knowledge and consent.' He was in effect a party to the deed', -and; as; such,, upon every principle of .right and justice he is bound by it. The abject of the settlement is not alone for her benefit, but for the benefit of her children, who take as purchasers, and whose'rights are peculiarly under the protection of a-<a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>court of equity. The deed, it is true, is inartificially drawn; but enough appears to indicate that by the term “heirs at law” of the wife, it was intended to designate the children of the marriage. Now, how does the case stand on the bill ? At the time it was filed there wrere four children the issue of the marriage. They, as well as the trustee, are made parties to the bill. The subpoena is served on the trustee for form sake, and on Thomas G. Robinson, appointed by the court guardian <em>ad litem, </em>the 7th January, 1846, alsq for form only. The 31st January, 1846, the guardian files his answer. The 11th April following, the trustee withdraws his appearance. It seems he never filed any answer. On the same day the guardian appointed for the express purpose of protecting the rights of the children, withdraws his answer, and, what is still more strange, with leave of the court, withdraws his appearance, and on the same day the court decrees the reformation of the contract. Thus a court of equity, acting under some strange delusion, have entirely changed the deed of trust, left the wife and children without any protection, on the bare allegation of the wife and husband, the latter having a deep and direct interest in procuring the alteration, by means of which he' afterwards secures to himself the whole estate, or which is the same thing, sells it, and he pockets the money. In effect, no answer, no appearance, either by the trustee or the faithful guardian.</p>

This presents a case of such gross imposition upon the court, that the decree cannot, in my judgment, impair, or in any manner affect either the title of the wife or the rights of the minor children. They remain unaffected by the decree, and in precisely the same situation they were before the court undertook to reform the deed. So anxious are courts of equity to protect infants, that in Mills <em>v. </em>Dennis et al., <a href="/johns-ch/3/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="3 Johns. Ch. 367" data-case-ids="1976892" data-case-paths="/johns-ch/3/0367-01">3 Johns. Ch. Rep. 367</a>, the chancellor says, a decree cannot safely be obtained against an infant, upon the mere fact of taking the bill <em>pro confesso, </em>or upon an answer in form by the guardian <em>ad litem. </em>The answer in such cases generally is, that the infant knows nothing of the matter, and therefore neither admits nor denies the charges, but leaves the plaintiff to prove them as he shall be advised, and throws himself upon the protection of the court. A decree upon such an answer W'ould not bind the infant, and he could open it or set it aside <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>when he comes of age. No laches can be imputed to an infant, and no valid decree can be awarded against him merely by default. The plaintiff in every such case ought to-prove his demand either in court ór before a master, and the infánt is usually entitled to a day, to show cause when he comes of age..</p>

In that case it is ruled that a vendee will not be compelled to accept a doubtful title, and the vendor cannot therefore recover in an action for the purchase money, when his title depends upon an act of the legislature, which authorizes him to sell and convey the estate in fee-simple, in which, .before the passage of the act, he had but a liferestate. As in that case, the children whose rights are materially affected, are not before us, except indirectly, nor were they represented' before the legislature. They are not concluded, for although their rights are not expressly saved, the act' binds none but the parties. Under the authority of that act, we cannot say that the title is-good, as it may be that the children may assert a right which is unquestionable under the original deed.</p>
