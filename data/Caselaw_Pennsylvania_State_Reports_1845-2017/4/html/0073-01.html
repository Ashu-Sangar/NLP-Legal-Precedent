He drew up the paper, bearing date July 16th, 1841, without the interlineations. I presented it to Mr. Henry Sterling, who is the endorser.on one of the notes of Baird and Huey, for $1300, which was to be included in the arrangement. He objected to signing, unless it was stated in the paper how often it was to be renewed, and how much it was to be reduced at each renewal, and stated that he wanted to know when he might expect to get clear of the responsibility. He (Sterling) then took the paper, prepared by Simpson, and inserted the interlineations.

The attorney .of the .bank-drew'up a paper which was presented to Sterling, who refused to sign it on the ground of its fixing no time when his responsibility should cease,.and interlined the provision that the note should be reduced from five to ten per-cent, every sixty daysthe instrument 'was then presented to. the gentleman that acted as attorney for the bank, who agreed- to the paper as .altered by-’Sterling, and .it was afterwards taken to him,-and under the impression that the ingredient of reduction of the note was.the-c'ondiiion of his engagement, he executed it. ■ The paper was then delivered to the bank, which accepted it, and acted upon it, and has retained it-since that period. .It will.not do, under such circumstances, to saythát the-contract is' obligatory on Sterling for -the benefit of the bank, and . not 'against the .-bank'as to those stipulations which were intended for.the safety of Sterling. By-an irresistible implication, the paper as to these stipulations became' the contract of the bank aS effectually as if.it had been signed by its'proper officer, and Sterling, reposing on'its faith, had a right to believe that the note would be regularly reduced at .each-renewal until the debt- should be extinguished—an impression as clearly justified by the terms of the written contract as by the parol testimony. It was strongly urged in the argument of the. cause, .that the-bank had .ho inducement to bind itself on the subject matter,.as Sterling was already fixed for the debt. : It is of nq consequence in this cause, what inducement the bank had for entering into the arrangement. It doubtless considered it- in some .way advantageous; as institutions óf that description usually'act with a special regard to’-th'eir own interests. It probábly considered.Huey at that-'time a good.customer, and that the interest and reductions being paid according to the understanding of the parties, would afford a profitable employment of the money'., Be that as it may, the agreement was consummated, and there' was a sufficient consideration to support the .contract. Any forbearance of a money right at law- or equity, if done at the request, express or implied, of the other party, imports a consideration. There is a distinction between a merely voluntary engagement and one on the faith of which the other party does some act or enters into some engagement. Now, Sterling did agree to forbear a' right which he had. <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>inequity to enforce the creditor to proceed on the protested note; and he waived his right to pay it <em>bft </em>himself, and proceed against the principal.. He thus disarmed himself of two important legal rights, at ,a time when, by pursuing either, he might have made, himself perfectly safe; for it’ appears by the testimony, that- Huey-was then in all probability, of sufficient ability to have paid the note, and -he thus disabled himself at the instance of the bank, which requested the paper to be drawn for that very purpose. These' stipulations on the part, of Sterling afforded the consideration on. which the.-bank agreed to the provision,, introduced by Sterling himself, that the note should be reduced from five to’ ten per cent., every sixty'days, and that engagement on the part of the-bank was the consideration or condition of the engagement made on the.part of Sterling not to take advantage .of the delay.
