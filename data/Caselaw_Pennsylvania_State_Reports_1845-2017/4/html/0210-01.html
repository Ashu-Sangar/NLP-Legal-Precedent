To combine and confederate, to cheat and defraud the citizens of this Commonwealth, for the unlawful purpose of making a false representative of the bank notes of a bank of a sister state to circulate within this Commonwealth, is a species of the <em>crimen falsi </em>and a high misdemeanor.

Lewis was convicted of the crime of uttering and publishing counterfeit notes of the Hagerstown Bank. It was held, that that offence would have been punished with whipping or the pillory, prior to the 27lh of March, 1789. The conspiracy to make false and forged notes, purporting to be bank notes, is surely as high a crime as the uttering and publishing, where the intent is to cheat and defraud. The act, with its supplement, which authorizes the penitentiary punishment, gives the court a discretion of some years. Surely the court can discriminate between a conspiracy to forge and make false and fraudulent bank notes, and the actual making and forging. But either is an infamous crime, and punishable by the act of 1790, sect. 4, which declares, that every person convicted of any offence not capitable, for which, by the laws in force before the passage of the act, burning in the hand, cutting off the ears, placing in the pillory, is, or may be inflicted, shall, instead of such parts of the punishment, be sentenced to hard labour. Nor is there any error in the form of the sentence; it is in substance the sentence which the law authorizes.</p>
