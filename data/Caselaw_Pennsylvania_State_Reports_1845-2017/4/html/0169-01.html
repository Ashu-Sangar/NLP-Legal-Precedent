      <em>Oct. </em>1. This was an action on two notes dated the 26th and 28th February, respectively, in the following form: «Due Conrad Zinn, 17§ bushels of wheat at $1 per bushel, payable at pur mill in Girard, in twelve days from date.” The other was for $10, at one month, payable in wheat or corn, the former at $1, and the latter at 50 cents per bushel. The plea was payment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b169-9" data-blocks='[["BL_169.7",169,[189,992,1187,623]]]'>Defendant then gave in evidence that he directed seventeen or eighteen bushels of wheat to be put away in a bin in the mill to meet the first note, which was done early in March; and that ten and a half bushels had been placed in barrels to meet another note about the 1st of April. It was put away in small quantities as fast as toll ■was taken at the mill. A witness for the plaintiff stated the $10 note had been left with him to demand the grain, and on the day it fell due he had gone to the mill, and was told the grain was ready. He said he had orders from plaintiff tó have it measured out and put in a box by itself. Plaintiff replied he had not a box to put it in. The wheat in the bin was shown to and examined by the witness, and he supposed there was not more than fifteen or sixteen bushels. All this grain was burned on the 8th of April.</p>

Story on Contracts, secs. 503, 504, 512. The mere retention of a thing previously in his possession is not sufficient. Neither trover nor replevin could have been maintained under this evidence. Nor did this evidence agree with the plea, as appears from the cases already cited. If the plea had been in regular form, the evidence would not have sustained an averment of “ always ready,” which is essential.</p>
