Five thousand dollars were paid, and.the balance secured-by a bond and mortgage, payable in ten annual instalments. In February, 1837, the purchasers partitioned by deed, James Sennett taking No. 1,- valued at <em>$9500; </em>Williams No. 2, at $4840; Graham No. 3, at $4440; and Cochran No. 4, at $6220.

Sennett was to pay $1500, Williams $1000, and Graham $500; the two <em>latter </em>paid their respective shares in cash.

The amount of’.'the- original purchase money,, which was to be secured by J.

Shortly before the proposed sheriff’s sale was made, Warren refused to conveyv to J. Sennett in consequence of an assignment, made by'him, and his want of means to comply with his agreement. With J. Sennett’s consent, it was agreed that the deed for No. 1 should be made, to Williams, J. Sennett having the privilege of paying within one year the amount due to Warren on lot No.' 1, and the value of the improvements which should be made by Williams. Under this agreement, the sheriff’s sale was made'on’May 5,1842, and a deed by Warren to Williams, who on the same day entered, and continued ever since in possession. In December, 1843, Graham and Williams paid the $1500 on the judgment to Warren, and it was assigned to Warren’s use, he being entitled to six-elevenths, and Graham to five-elevenths, the respective proportions of the amount paid by them. On the 20th April, 1842, Pardon Sennett and Lester purchased certain other lots from J. Sennett.

In Substance it is this. J. S. Sennett, Williams, Cochran, and Graha'm, purchased a lot-from Warren, paid part of the purchase money, and gave bond with warrant, on which judgment was entered for the rest. They made partition among themselves, and agreed to pay separately for their shares,. Warren taking back the legal title he-had conveyed to them, and reconveying separately to them their respective shares: an arrangement he sanctioned by purchasing back the title on his own.execution. At the day for the final execution of it, however, J. S. Sennett was unable to perform his part of it; and the judgment before us, in which he and P. Sennett appear as principals, with Williams and Graham as sureties, was taken as so much cash; but the deed for his part was made to Williams, with an understanding that he might redeem it by payment within a year. He never did redeem it, and Williams, who paid the judgment, and now is the absolute owner of thé property, insists on being substituted for Warren, and on having the judgment levied for his use on two other lots bound by it, but subsequently sold by J. S. Sennett to P. Sennett and Lester. . _</p>

Sennett’s 'debt, after Williams had become the owner of his property and the principal debtor for it, would compel third parties to put just so much of their proper money into his pocket. What is his supposed equity? tie went into the judgment as a surety, but under an arrangement .which might, and eventually did, make him the purchaser of the property and principal debtor; for it was no part of the bargain that he was to get the property, and that any one élse was to pay for it.. What is the money which he attempts to extract from these two lots ? It is the price which he paid for property of which he now is the absolute owner, and which, were he to succeed, he would get for nothing. When he took J. S. Sennett’s. place in thé purchase, he took not only his property but his responsibilities, and he consequently ceased to be a surety ; for that a surety may, in the course of events, become a principal, is shown by the Bank of Pennsylvania <em>v. </em>Winger, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Rawle%20303" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="1 Rawle 303">1 Rawle, 303</a>.
