The vendors agreed-to make-a good-deed with general warranty, upon receipt of the third 'instalment, at which' time "the .vended was to give his notes with security for the residue of the purchase money. The defendants proved payments on account of the purchase’ money, but at the time,the third instalment fell due, but $211 had. been paid, the total amount then due being $350. Before ’.'Ijis’was fully paid, other instalments’fell due, and- at all times the defendants were in arrear for the subsequent instalments, though they had completed the payment of the third-and the previous instalments. It was admitted that, after the sale, and before the action was commenced, one of the vendors (plaintiffs) had entered into a recognisance as surety for the coroner of the county where the lands were, and another of the vendors had become surety for the sheriff.</p>

Subsequent to the day, however, the title became indubitably encumbered; and the defendant objected at the trial against being compelled to take it in that plight. But though equity will' not compel a vendee to take a <em>defective </em>title, it will compel him to take a <em>good </em>title subject to a <em>pecuniary </em>charge, against which adequate security has been given. The distinction is taken in Fildes <em>v. </em>Hooker, 3 Mad. Rep. 193, in order to reconcile that case to Halsey <em>v. </em>Grant, 13 Ves. 75, and Horniblow <em>v. </em>Shirley, id. 81, in which specific performance was decreed on security given against such an encumbrance. The case before us falls directly within the principle; and as the <em>qu.es-. </em>tion of adequacy was for the jury, the direction was clearly right.</p>
