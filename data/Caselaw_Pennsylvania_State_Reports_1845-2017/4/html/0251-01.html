      <em>Oct. 22. </em>This case wras argued at the last term, and stood over for judgment until this day. It was an ejectment brought in April, 1842, to compel, by a conditional verdict, performance of an agreement by the defendant to'purchase. The articles were dated September 16th; 1837, by which it was agreed the payment of the purchase money, which .was $1400, was to be made thus : Hall, the purchaser, «is to give certain notes and a mortgage which he now holds against Holmes, (the vendor,) to answer on this contract so <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>far as it goes, and the notes and mortgages to be given up -when the deed is given; also one span of horses for what they are worth, and the balance to be paid in cash, at the rate of $200 per year, until the whole is paid <em>with interest; </em>and the said Holmes doth agree, he has a good right to sell, and that he will give a good deed for the same; and said Hall, that he will pay as above slated, and that he will give good security for the same, either by signers to the notes or a mortgage on the land.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b252-3" data-blocks='[["BL_252.4",252,[324,809,1179,383]]]'>Defendant proved that the horses were appraised and received by the vendor, and that late in 1837 or in 1838, they met to settle the matter, but separated without a tender of the mortgage, which was drawn, but Holmes insisted on having interest added in. Defendant also gave in evidence the mortgage to secure $1400, dated in 1833, and three notes of the plaintiff, for $275 each, on which interest had been paid until 1835 and $194 of the principal, which were those referred to in the agreement.</p>

That the purchase money fell due by annual instalments, commencing one year from the date of the articles, and that if the plaintiff was entitled to interest, it was to be calculated from such times respectively. The notes and mortgage agreed to be delivered up by the purchaser were to be applied as a present credit at the date of the sale.</p>

    <p id="b253-8" data-blocks='[["BL_253.12",253,[213,1328,1186,579]]]'>We have nothing on the record but the article and the charge of the district judge. The ejectment was to April Term, 1842, and the question was, whether the plaintiff had tendered his deed at the proper time, and before the suit was brought. The construction of the article, and whether the plaintiff below ought to have tendered a deed before the suit was brought, was the question below as well as in this court. The charge of the judge shows that the plaintiff on the 8th of March, 1839, tendered a deed and demanded $200 as being then due. The defendant denied that any thing was due; that the first payment of $200 only became due a year after the deed was made, and offered, but made no tender of the notes and mortgage mentioned in the agreement.</p>

There- a deed which 'had erasures had been tendered before suit brought, and brought into court on the trial, and such as the defendant was not bound to accept, an erased deed not. being such a deed as a vendor ought to furnish. The deed being filed in the court below, a court of error will allow the plaintiff to execute a new deed in its stead, and affirm the judgment, provided the plaintiff, before the 5th of April, 1845, filed in the court below a good and sufficient deed like that on record, but free from erasures, to be at the disposal of the defendant on complying with the verdict; otherwise, to be reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>awarded.
