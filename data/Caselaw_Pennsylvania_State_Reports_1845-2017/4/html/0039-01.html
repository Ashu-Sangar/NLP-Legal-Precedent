We contend that under the' agreement Jaynes was personally responsible for the payment of $2000, the entire consideration mentioned in the agreement. It is not denied that he is personally responsible for the payment of $1000, at the times and in the manner specified. But it is con<a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>tended, that for the payment of the remaining $1000, the plaintiff was bound to look to the rents of the houses'; tfiat the houses were responsible. Such was not the intention of the parties; and such a construction cannot-be-given to the covenants. 'The plaintiff, it will be observed, is not only to do the work, but to furnish all the materials. The defendant is to pay $2000. In "relation to $1000, of this sum-there is no difference of opinion. How is the remaining $1000 to be paid ? -It is to be paid out of the rents quarterly; the whole to be applied for that purpose. The defendant was to rent the houses and receive the rents. Out of the rents—his own rents— so to be received, the defendant was to pay the plaintiff. He is, therefore, as clearly personally responsible for the remaining $1000, as he was for the payment of the first. But the court below-charged that the plaintiff was to look (under the agreement) for the last payment. to the fund to be raised by the rents, and not to the personal responsibility of the defendant. It cannot be- pretended for a moment that the plaintiff, under the agreement, had a lien either upon the houses or the rents. He had no interest in either that he could touch. He could not-have insured. The plaintiff has complied with his part of the contract, and the law will hold the defendant- to a strict compliance with his. It has, to be sure, become impossible for him to pay us our $1000 out of the rents, but this will not relieve him from personal responsibility; and the .law will compel him to respond in damages to that amount. If the houses had not been destroyed, we could have recovered as soon as we could have shown that a sufficient amount of- rents had become due; now that they have been burnt down, we would have to show the value of the property and yearly rental, and from this to establish the fact that a sufficient amount would have been due. . .</p>

If the houses had been burned down before they were finished, the plaintiff would have been bound, inlaw, under his contract,to rebuild.

It was the intention and understanding of the parties at the time the agreement was executed, that the defendant, Jaynes, should make himself personally responsible for $1000 only, and that the rents of the houses should constitute the fund for the payment of the remaining $1000. The defendant knew his own circumstances, and that he could not with safety bind himself personally for more than that sum. He in all probability contemplated that they might be destroyed by fire, or that he might not be able to rent them. The plaintiff meets his views and also his apprehensions, and agrees to share the risk and hazard. He agreed to take the defendant personally for $1000, and the rents for the balance. The mode of payment is expressly set out in the agreement. ‘That part for which the defendant was to be personally responsible is first specified, and in the next place, that for which the houses were to be responsible. The last payment to be made, not out of the land, but out of the rents of the houses to be built by the plaintiff. The plaintiff agreed to take the rents as the fund for the last payment, and, now that that fund is gone, attempts to get clear of his share of responsibility. There is no averment or allegation in the declaration that rents were received, nor that the lessees were solvent or able to pay; but merely that the houses had been rented. They cannot therefore recover in this suit.
