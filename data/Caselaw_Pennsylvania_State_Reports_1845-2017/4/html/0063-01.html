His <em>scire facias </em>was against him, and hi's <em>fi.fa., </em>levy and sale was of:all the right, title, interest, and claim of McCullough. That title, interest, and claim was a six years’ lease. The counsel for the plaintiff in error contends that the opinion of this court, as delivered by Mr. Justice Kennedy, in the case of Ho'Idship against Abercrombie, <a href="/watts/9/0052-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="9 Watts 52" data-case-ids="1849973" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0052-01">9 Watts, 52</a>, being a former ejectment for the same premises, determines this case in favour of the. defendant in this ejectment. I have looked carefully into the record in that case. I find that that ejectment was brought in the Common Pleas on the 25th March, 1837; tried on the 1st June,’ 1838. The lease to McCullough did not end until the 1st April, 1839. In that case, the title was in the plaintiff. It was impossible to resist a recovery, if the point had been made. The title of McCullough by the sheriff’s sale was vésted in Abercrombie, and that title was then in full force. . An ejectment in Pennsylvania is a possessory action, and Abercrombie was entitled to the possession beyond all question, until'the 1st of April, 1839. Nor was the’point in that case made, that although the proceeding was thought to be <em>in rertv, </em>the holder of the legal title was not brought on the record, and that, after the lien filed, the whole proceeding against McCullough was as' in the ordinary case of debt. Such a proceeding cannot divest him in remainder. It had no operation on the title of Doctor Herron. Although inadequacy of price is no ground to set .aside a sheriff’s sale, yet it is manifest from the price, that every person knew and supposed that only the title of McCullough was selling, when a productive property in the heart of the city of Pittsburgh only brought what was equal to one year’s rent, and that, before the brick tan-house was erected. It is said, many sales will be affected unless the court hold that the fee passed in this case. I doubt this. But, if it were true, that is no reason why a wrong construction should be given to'our mechanics’ lien law. If such construction has been given in a case that did not require it, it is our duty to correct it. What is this case ? A lien filed against a mere tenant who is putting up a building for his own <em>convenience; no </em>other person brought upon the record no notice by <em>scire facias, </em>or otherwise, to the owner of'.the premises.; a levy and sale of all the right, title, and interest of that tenant. Nothing passed by the sheriff’s sale but the title levied. Nothing more was sold and conveyed by the sheriff. This has been determined in many cases. I need only refer to Carpenter <em>v. </em>Cameron, <a href="/watts/7/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="7 Watts 51" data-case-ids="1846787" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0051-01">7 Watts, 51</a>, and McCormick <em>v. </em>Harvey, <a href="/watts/9/0482-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="9 Watts 482" data-case-ids="1850020" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0482-01">9 Watts, 482</a>.
