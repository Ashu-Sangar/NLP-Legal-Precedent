A warrant to confess judgment contains not only a, grant of the authority expressed clearly and intelligibly, but a designation, by name or description, of the person who is to execute it. The act of Assembly merely substitutes the prothonotary, though <em>not named or described, for an </em>attorney of the <em>court; </em>but it supplies no deficiency of the power given in the first instance. This writing expresses no more than a vague desire that it be recorded, which is certainly an insufficient authority for the prothonotary’s act. The defect held to be amendable in Helvete <em>v. </em>Rapp, <a href="/serg-rawl/7/0306-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Serg. &amp; Rawle 306" data-case-ids="1808220" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/7/0306-01">7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 306</a>, was in the execution of the authority, not in a want of it, which nothing can cure. It is to be regretted that the security intended cannot be had; but the loss is not more grievous than is usually suffered when ignorant men undertake to be their own lawyers. Order and judgment reversed.</p>
