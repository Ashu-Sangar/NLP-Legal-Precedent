      <em>Féb. </em>19. This was an action against the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas, to recover the penalty of $50, under the acts of 1821. The declaration, commencing in debt, set out the title of the officer; that his fees were regulated by the act of 1821, and that defendant, on, &amp;c., within six months, &amp;c., “under colour of his office, did charge, demand, and take of, and from the said plaintiff, the sum of $4 25, for certain services alleged to have been done .and performed by him, the said defendant, as such officer in a certain suit wherein,” &amp;c., which said sum “ was greater, and other fees than is expressed and limited by the acts,” &amp;c.</p>

Such acts are always construed as repealing prior remedies. 3 U. S. Dig., cases cited 482, 488. [Burnside, J.—The act gives a cumulative remedy.] I submit that before the acts of 1814 and 1821, the remedy was by indictment at common law; after those, it was for the penalty; then by the act of 1830, by indictment under the statute.</p>

The <em>narr. </em>charging generally, that the defendant, for services done by him as sheriff, took other and greater fees than were allowed by the act of Assembly, was adjudged incurably defective in Aechternacht <em>v. </em>Watmough, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0162-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 162" data-case-ids="483330" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0162-01">8 Watts &amp; Serg. 162</a>. Here the judgment was arrested for the same reason which governed that case; namely, that the <em>narr. </em>does not specify the illegal fees, the services <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>of the prothonotary, nor the particulars of either the fees or services for which the penalty is claimed. No difference is perceived between the cases, -except that one is a suit against a sheriff, the other against a prothonotary. In every other particular, they are precisely the same. It is not the duty of the court to point out the form of a declaration on the statute. We, however, do not perceive the insurmountable difficulties which the counsel for the plaintiff in error seems to suppose, for, in addition to the suggestions in the case -cited, the plaintiff may, previous to filing his <em>narr., </em>procure a copy of the docket entries, which will serve to show the services of the officer, and remove all difficulties on that head.</p>

The act of the 25th March, 1831, on which the defendant in error relies, is, in addition to any penalty or penalties to which by any existing laws the officer guilty of extortion may be subject. These are the words of the act, and must govern its construction.</p>
