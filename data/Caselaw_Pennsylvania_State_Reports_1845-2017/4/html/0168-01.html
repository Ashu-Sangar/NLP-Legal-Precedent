      <em>Oct. </em>1. In an action of debt on a note, the defence was a breach of warranty of a horse sold by defendant in error to the plaintiff in error. It was proved that the horse was warranted sound excepting in one particular, and that he was in fact otherwise unsound.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b168-7" data-blocks='[["BL_168.8",168,[349,1288,1178,226]]]'>The question was, the measure of damages, the court instructing the jury the value of the horse given in exchange was immaterial, as the measure of damages was the difference between the value of the horse sold with a warranty, if he had turned out to be as warranted, and his actual value.</p>

It is impossible also to see what the value of the horse he gave in exchange had to do with the matter. If he made a bad bargain, assuming the horse he got to be sound, he is not to be reimbursed what he lost by his simplicity, as damages for a breach of the warranty. The defendant in error must make his warranty good or pay the difference; but he is not bound to surrender any advantage he fairly obtained by the bargain, and the court allowed him to retain no more. Judgment affirmed.</p>
