      <em>Oct. </em>20. The defendant in error brought an action in the court below, in which he filed a statement of his claim on a promissory note of- the defendants. A reference, and award for the plaintiffs, having been made, the court permitted a declaration on the note to be filed, <em>but </em>withdrew <em>permission to </em>declare on a book-account after an appeal from the award, as having been improvidently granted. The defendants dissolved partnership on the 11th November, 1840, when they were indebted to the plaintiff on a book-account.

The drawer had no express authority to settle the concerns of the firm, but continued his separate business in the same establishment. . •</p>
