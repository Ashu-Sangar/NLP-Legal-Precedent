      <em>Feb. </em>15, 16. N. G. Gilman, jun., filed a petition in the Orphans’ Court, setting forth that John Gardiner, jun., died on the 4th of January, 1830, having made a will dated the 2d of November, 1829, whereby he devised to Wright and Sharpe, and their survivors in fee, in trust, as to one moiety of the residue of his estate, for the separate use of Elizabeth Gilman, wife of N. Gilman, for life, remainder in trust for every child and children of Elizabeth, who might be living at the time of her decease, as tenants in common in fee. As to the other moiety in trust for the separate use of his daughter Mary Gardiner for life, remainder to such <em>child or children </em>as might be living at the time of her decease as tenants in common in fee. If she died without leaving issue, then as to one moiety of said moiety in trust for the same uses as was declared of the moiety devised in trust for Elizabeth; and as to the other moiety of said moiety, in trust for his son Richard, for life, remainder to every child or children which he might leave, &amp;c., remainder to the right heirs of Richard.</p>

That Elizabeth died in 1838, leaving a husband and seven children, the eldest of whom was the petitioner; and the three younger being minors, that their father had been appointed guardian by the court. That Mary, the daughter of testator, had intermarried with Charles Dilworth, and was yet living, and prayed an inquest to partition, if it could be done without prejudice. An inquest was awarded, and then a demurrer was filed by the trustee, praying the inquest; might be set aside.

After this, Charles Dilworth, guardian of the minor children of Mary Dilworth, late Gardiner, filed a petition setting forth the death of said Mary since the order of sale, and praying leave to become a party to the proceedings on behalf of said minors. This was granted, and on motion the sale was confirmed, and the administrator of John Gardiner, jun., directed to. convey, subject to the charge of one-third of the purchase money, in lieu of the widow’s dower according to the act of Assembly, the interest to be paid annually, recoverable by distress.

The question is on the act of 13th April, 1840, this being a case in which the course of descent is altered by a will. Before the death of Mrs. Dihvorth there was no vested interest in any one, for until that event happened, the parties who were to take were not ascertained. Before the act relied on, it is clear there was no jurisdiction, and that act must be construed simply as an enlargement of an existing jurisdiction. It must mean in like cases with that previously existing. Otherwise the birth of a child would avoid the whole proceeding, for unless the Orphans’ Court has all the powers of a Court of Chancery, which has never yet been held, there is no power to bar or protect such future interest. This construction requires that <em>or </em>should be read <em>and </em>in the act of Assembly. The other exceptions are of inferior consequence. It is impossible to say the jury would have found as they have, if they had been directed to make partition among the devisees. [Rogers, J.—The court could not amend after inquest against the consent of those interested. But there is a great difference as to the party objecting. The consent of parties would cure the defect.]</p>

Does it mean to give jurisdiction either where there is a will in any part of the title, or where there may be minors? If both must concur, there was no jurisdiction in this case. If it be construed in the alternative, then the jurisdiction will depend in the one case on a matter <em>in pais, </em>susceptible of subsequent contradiction, viz. the fact of a minority. The right to avoid for- this cannot be waived by an infant: he cannot give jurisdiction by consent. Again, when must there be a minority ? Is it to be at the termination or at the commencement of the proceedings. [Rogers, J.—If the jurisdiction once attached, subsequent events would not destroy it.] On the other hand, if the existence of a will anywhere in the chain of title is to give jurisdiction, that would extend it to all cases. [Rogers, J.—That would be monstrous.] The proper limitation, and the only one, is the minority of the parties who are <em>immediately to </em>take by the will; which construction avoids the jurisdiction in this case. Short of this, there is no point at which to stop, but the case put. But the jurisdiction must be exercised according to the will, not against it, 'as here. Nor is there any act allowing the courts to sweep away the rights of the unborn devisees. The act referred to, directs the money to remain as a charge■; here it is to be paid to a trustee. The simple question is, whether the case provided for has arisen ? The rules of chancery cannot be invoked successfully. There can. be no sale there in any case, as is shown in 8 Ves. 1.43. Nor is there any representation: that court requires, not a naked trustee of the whole estate, but of the particular right to be affected ; 2 Ves., jun., 122; and the practice is to respite the conveyances until the infant parties come of age.</p>

The section empowers the Orphans’ Court to make partition in all cases of testacy “ where the parties interested, or any of them, are minors ; <em>or </em>the course of descent is not altered” by the will. Why send parties, merely because there is not a minor among them, into the Common Pleas for partition of land not even attempted to be-devised to them, or, if attempted, devised to them exactly as it is given to them by the law, which casts the inheritance upon them in exclusion of the will, compelling them to take by their preferable title ? There is no reason for not allowing the parties to choose their forum, as well where all are of age, as where some of them are infants; and it is expressly provided, that in all cases within the act, any of the parties may proceed by action of partition as heretofore. If, however, infancy were to be an ingredient in all cases of this special jurisdiction, adult parties who had taken by the statute and not by the will, would be confined to the Orphans’ Court alone. But jurisdiction had previously been given to the Orphans’ Court in cases of intestacy generally; and a doubt, for which there was no solid foundation, had prevailed, but which it was the purpose of the second clause to remove, whether parties could proceed in the Orphans’ Court for the partition of descended land in a case of partial intestacy. The clause was unnecessary; but the office it was designed to perform was very different from the office to be performed by the clause coupled with it. Whether the land had descended or passed by the will, the object was to give the Orphans’ Court concurrent jurisdiction whenever one of the parties should be a minor; and to commit the protection of his interest to its peculiar care. If that was not the object, both clauses amount to absolutely nothing ; for there has not been a time since 1794, when the Orphans’ Court might not hold jurisdiction in partition of descended land, whether any of the parties were minors or not. If it was not intended to empower that court to make partition, in the case of a minor, according to the devises in a will, the legislature meant nothing.</p>

Without this limitation, the statute could seldom be executed ; for it would be impossible to provide for the security of contingent interests. In this instance, had the wffiarf itself been capable of partition, the interests vested under the will <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>might have been parted by assigning to Mary Gardiner, now Mrs. Dilworth, her estate for life in her property, and leaving the contingent remainders dependent on it to vest at her death in such as should be,,in <em>esse </em>according to the limitations in the will. Being incapable of division, however, it was sold; and the price of it is in the hands of the trustee, as the equivalent of the realty. What, then, is there in the case, to prevent the court from disposing of it, as the realty would have been disposed of had it been divided in kind ? Mrs. Dilworth is entitled to the interest of it during her life; and the principal is to be paid to her children at her death. What remains then is to have it, in the mean time, invested by the trustee under the direction of the Orphans’ Court, which possesses, within its sphere, the incidental powers of a Court of Chancery. It may order it to be invested in real securities at legal interest, or in certificates of stock, or in any other way it may judge to be best; and it will be its business to give the whole matter its particular supervision, compelling the trustee to follow its directions. At present, there is no more to do, than to say, that the exceptions to the confirmation of the sale are not sustained. Decree affirmed.</p>
