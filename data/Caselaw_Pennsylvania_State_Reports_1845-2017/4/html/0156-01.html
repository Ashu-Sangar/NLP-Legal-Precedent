To destroy the effect of this rebutting evidence, and to sustain an originally proved title, the evidence offered 'was direct, and, under the authorities cited above, conclusive. 2 McC. 161.

To us it appears, that this evidence was clearly rebutting. How did the defendant know that the plaintiff would rely on the proceedings in the Common Pleas, declaring him an habitual drunkard ? The rules of court are made to facilitate the administration of justice, not to entangle it in technical objections. A defendant, under a proper construction of the rule which requires him to deliver an abstract of his title, cannot anticipate every point which may arise in the cause. He certainly is not to set out all his parol evidence, nor the evidence to rebut every possible point that may arise on the trial, as the rules are made to further the administration of justice. We dislike interfering with the Common Pleas in the construction of their own rules, and only do so where the construction is too narrow and works injustice. We think, in this case, 'the evidence should have been received.</p>

The inquisition and confirmation finding the plaintiff <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>an habitual drunkard, affects his capacity to dispose of after-acquired property as much as property then in possession.</p>

As abstract propositions, I do not think they are subject to objection. But as this case goes back to be tried again, it may be of moment to present the manner it ought to be presented to the jury; the counsel not having done it at the trial. It is true that this court settled, in Clark <em>v. </em>Caldwell, <a href="/watts/6/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="6 Watts 139" data-case-ids="1846062" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0139-01">6 Watts, 139</a>, 140, that contracts of an habitual drunkard, made after inquisition found and before its confirmation, are void. This, on the authority of the act of Assembly, which was intended for the protection of the estate and property of the unfortunate drunkard after inquisition found pending a traverse or contest before confirmation. I am not to be understood as impairing the authority of that case. But this case is very different. Here the inquisition was confirmed on the 26th October, 1829. The commissioners never acted, never gave bond, nor took upon themselves the trust. Gilleland, so far as the case shows, acts as if no proceeding had been had against him. He buys and sells this real estate. His friends proceed no further to perfect the proceedings against him. The record shows no act from October, 1829, to March Term, 1843, a period over thirteen years, when he applies and has the whole proceeding superseded. He bought the property in question in 1831. The same year he sells it to Parry Grove, and subsequently receives the whole purchase money from Grove. After this, Grove, who resided on the land both before and in pursuance of his purchase, becomes indebted, and the property is levied on and sold as the estate of Grove by the sheriff. Gilleland attends the sale, makes no objection, but it is said encouraged the sale. This -was on the 16th March, 1843 ; three days before this, on the 13th March, 1843, the “ commission, inquisition, and all proceedings thereon superseded and determined by the court.” The deed is acknowledged on the 29th March without objection.' The purchaser pays- his money. If these are the facts of the case, and the records and evidence show them, why should the defendant lose the land ? For my part, I have no idea of an imperfect proceeding for thirteen years, the committee never acting, the family <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>and friends of the drunkard permitting him to buy and sell real estate; that he shall, on such a plea, and such a plea only, recover the property he bought and sold, and was paid for. It would be such a fraud that no court could for a moment tolerate.</p>
