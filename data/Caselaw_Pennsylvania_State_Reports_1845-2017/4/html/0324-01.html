To be in the nature of a bank note, does not require that the paper should be of the exact form of a bank note in words. It must partake of its nature so far as to be fitted.to pass from hand to hand, as a circulating medium. This characteristic is, in my judgment, the true criterion. A little reflection will clearly demonstrate this posi<a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>tion. A promissory note in the nature of a bank note, in its enlarged and liberal sense, would comprehend any instrument having that form, given by one individual to another for money loaned, or for a debt contracted on the purchase of lands or goods between individuals, though limited to a single transaction in the usual course of business. This was not intended, and in spirit the statute does not touch such transactions. This, itself, teaches us that the language of the act, and the mischief to be prevented must be considered together, in giving an interpretation to this statute. The prohibition does not apply to private and single transactions in private life, in the ordinary and usual course of business, in the purchase and sale of property, and in giving securities for debts. The idea contained in the statute is far different from and beyond this. It is to prevent the making and issuing of paper, circulated and designed to circulate through the community for its ordinary purposes, as money. This is the sense in which I understand the words employed by our law-makers. This circulation was felt throughout the country, as a mischief deeply affecting the interest and property of all. To cut it up by the roots, was the object of the legislature in passing this law. If its prohibitions mean any thing, if the terms are not mere empty sounds, they must comprehend the making and issuing of any paper medium, by any unauthorized individual, or corporation, for the purpose of a common medium.”</p>

Is it not also within the words? It is in the form of a certificate of loan payable a year after date, with interest, to a particular individual or bearer at the company’s office. It is printed 'on the usual bank-note .paper, and • engraved with the embellishments of a bank note. Though in <em>the form of what is </em>popularly called a due-bill, it has the constituent parts of a promissory note; and, I doubt not, might be declared on as such. But if not a promissory note, it is certainly a ticket- or engagement of credit; and is it not in the nature of a bank note ? There can be no bank note which has not been issued by a bank; but there may be a note,- ticket, .or engagement of credit intended to have the properties and to do the office of-one; and that is the very substitute which the legislature intended to suppress. Now the properties of a bank note which distinguish it from any' other promissory note, are its adaptation to circulation by delivery from hand to hand, and the difficulty it presents t-o simulation; in which respects this paper is conformable to it. It is true the debt is not payable on demand, and it bears, interest in the mean time; but these are not essential differences. A' -bank’s post note is not the less a bank note; and if the statute might be eluded by extending the promise to payment of interest; it would seldom be enforced, for a nominal-rate per cent, would be as-operative as a substantial one. Even were the interest an object, though the computation of it at each exchange might be troublesome, it would not be a serious impediment to circulation; at least it wras not found so in -the circulation of the treasury notes, which were issued after the last war with England.</p>

None whatever but the naked posr session of the paper by the plaintiff. It was said in the King <em>v. </em>Beare that the possession of "a libel which has been published, is evidence to prove a publication of it by the possessor, b’ut certainly no one else. Where indeed a libel <em>has been </em>published, there is-a presumption that the maker of it is the publisher". But even this has been doubted by Lord Camden in Entick <em>v. </em>Carrington, 11 St. Tr. 322, (Harg. ed.; 19 Howl, ed., 1072;) who in speaking of the King <em>v. </em>Beare, said: “If all this be law) and I have at present n.o right to deny it, whenever a favourite libel is published (and these-compositions are apt to be favourites) the whole kingdom in a month o"r two becomes criminal, and it would be difficult to .find an innocent" jury among so many millions of offenders.” It is evident that this celebrated constitutional lawyer did not much relish the dóctrine.eveh when applied to the individual possessor. But surely it ought not to be applied to any one"else. The bare, possession of a newspaper is not evidence of publication even against the printer whose name it bears, it being necessary, to show in addition that the libellous matter was sold at his shop. In. McCorkle <em>v. Binns, </em><a href="/binn/5/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="5 Binn. 340" data-case-ids="1793655" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0340-01">5 Binn. 340</a>, (S.

No case can be found where the defendant has been fixed with the fact of circulation merely because he had let the paper slip from his custody. It has been held that giving counterfeit coin in charity, is not an uttering of it within any of the English statutes. But how, it has been asked, is the prosecutor to proceed ? It is certainly in his power to give some account of the paper, and to show how he came by it; or on the principle of McCorkle <em>v. </em>Binns, to prove that other notes of the stamp were in circulation without being repudiated by the company. He might perhaps prove that some of these had been actually issued by its officers. But for the want of some such evidence, there was nothing to be left to the jury.</p>
