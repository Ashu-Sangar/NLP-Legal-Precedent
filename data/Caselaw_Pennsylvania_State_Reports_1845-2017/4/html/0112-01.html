Then <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>gave in evidence a lease, dated the 3d July, 1841, from Magaw to Boland, whereby the premises were demised to him for ten years, at the rent of $300 per annum. Magaw was to keep up the eastern, and Boland the western half of the dam. Magaw reserved the right of selling the premises at any time, but compensating Boland for his improvements. After the lease was read, plaintiff called Magaw as a witness; objected to as <em>incompetent; </em>admitted and defendant excepted. This is the only error assigned in'the case.</p>

Magaw had a direct benefit in keeping up the dam. He had demised the premises for ten years. To insure his rent, his lease compelled him to see that the tenant had quiet and proper enjoyment of the demised premises. If the dam was not properly maintained, and the landlord/was bound to keep up the eastern half, the property leased was of little value.</p>

An executor brings an action for a debt due to his testator’s estate; the residuary legatee is not a competent witness.
