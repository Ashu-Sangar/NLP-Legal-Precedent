The Almanac show's that February, 1844, was leap year—February had twenty-nine days; and the Almanac further show's that the 17th of March, 1844, was Sunday. The law has been long settled, that the day on which the aw'ard is made is not -to be counted. The twentieth day thereafter is the last day for the appeal.

No office belonging, to our judicial tribunals is open on the Sabbath. Sunday is not a judicial day; therefore, when the last day given by the act of Assembly for an appeal happens on the Sabbath, the party has the next day to attend to that duty. Sims <em>v. </em>Hampton, <a href="/serg-rawl/1/0411-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Serg. &amp; Rawle 411" data-case-ids="1796769" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/1/0411-01">1 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 411</a>. It is not like a note due in bank, which is to be protested on Saturday, w'hen the last day of grace falls on Sunday; that is -regulated by the usage and custom of merchants, which is universal throughout the civilized world. These are settled rules that obviate all surprise and profanation of the Sabbath. In the case before us, the award was filed on the 26th of February; that day is not to be counted; but the month had twenty-nine days; this left three days in that month. The appeal was taken on the 18th of March, but the 17th was Sunday, and as <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>that was the twentieth day, the appeal was properly taken on the next day.</p>

This statute, which is reported to be in force in Pennsylvania, provides that the day of the le.ap year and the day before shall be holden as one day. He therefore contends the 29th of February has no existence as a day, is in fact no day, and never to be counted as a judicial day. No doubt this statute was passed in a barbarous age to produce uniformity of time ; to make all years count three hundre.d and sixty-five days, making the 28th and 29th of February every fourth or leap year count but one day. Robert’s Dig. 207, 208. It has no relation to the computation of time when a rule or a statute fixes a certain number of days.</p>
