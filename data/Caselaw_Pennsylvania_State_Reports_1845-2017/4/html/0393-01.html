Morris’s failure to return the lands in bankruptcy proved it not to have been an existing agreement then.—The court erred in their charge. The construciion of the endorsement should not have been left to the jury : the theory of their office supposes them incompetent to -that. From such a source great uncertainty must flow. The direction should have been that the plaintiffs had the legal title, and at most the defendants an equity incapable of enforcement, after the lapse of time, and in the absence of the terms of the contract. 9. Mr. Rawle had conveyed the lands to the Jordans and Levan, and had a lien for a part of the purchase money. His testimony was offered, not to the court to form a basis for second<a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>ary evidence, but to the jury; and the court commented on it in their charge.

In receiving the assessments of taxes there was error.

We showed he must have been, as the certificate from the land-office showed there were no such lands taken up by Martin.

The propositions <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>show that Martin was under obligations to discover, take up, and convey certain lands, for which Morris had advanced the money, and the Commonwealth received it. The lands not being vacant, the act of 1792 allowed these payments to be used in taking up other land. Under these circumstances, Martin applied to Morris, and they agreed that the. credits of Morris, and some money, should be further advanced to enable Martin to comply with his former contract, by which Morris was to have lands in Northumberland county. If appearing beyond a doubt, that Morris never, did get the lánd in Northumberland county, and that the credits advanced under this agreement were applied to the purchase of these particular lands, what interest had Martin ? simply a right to the surplus after satisfying his contract with Morris. He never did that, and therefore there was no surplus for him. It will be observed, Martin is nowhere charged with the purchase money; the applications are entered in his name, but Morris’s account is debited with the price. That he who pays has the title, is a familiar principle. <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20110" class="citation" data-index="53" data-cite="8 Watts 110">8 Watts, 110</a> <em>; <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20547" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="9 Watts 547">9 </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20547" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="9 Watts 547">Watts, 547</a>.

Had we a right to it ? To say not, would be to say the parties might have suppressed our evidence because in their possession. What is its manifest object ? plainly to prevent an improper claim being set up by mistake. ' It is like a will, in which he says: ‘These lands do not belong to me, for I have transferred my right to Morris, who has paid me for them.’ I take the meaning to be this: ‘ These lands do not belong to me, for I have sold them to Morris who has paid me, and the warrantees have conveyed by deeds-poll to him.’ Not that he had conveyed, for he had neither a legal or equitable title.

In that schedule he has about twenty-five thousand acres 'in Northumberland county, held by warrant-right, bought of Robert Martin, which he values at $1 per acre. ’ So in his return on oath to the commissioners of bankruptcy, under the act of Congress of 1800, he says nothing about these lands; but returns—« Robert Martin, he stands charged in my book with $1245 30, which is to be balanced by cost and charges of land agreed for; the agreements are among my papers.” It is then clear that the agreements between the parties has no reference to the lands in question; that Robert Martin paid the Commonwealth for the lands in dispute. It is true, Robert Morris enabled him to pay the state, and that Robert Morris was to be repaid in lands in Northumberland county, at 25 cents per acre.</p>

The plaintiffs having given evidence that they were heirs of Robert Martin, except Lewis Dewart, offered in evidence a deed,dated the 12th May, 1845, from George Grant to Mr. Dewurt. George Grant was a son of Deborah Grant, who was a daughter of Robert Martin. It was proved on the trial she died on the 22d February, 1845. This deed was objected to by the counsel of the defendant, and rejected by the court; and this forms the first assignment of error. • Lewis Dewart had been substituted as the plaintiff in the room of Deborah Grant, deceased, and the jury sworn. The deed was offered under the third section of the act of the 13th April, 1807, Dunlap; 201, it provides:. «No writ of ejectment shall abate by reason 'of the death of any plaintiff or defendant, but the person <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>or persons next in interest may be substituted in the place of the plaintiff or defendant, who shall have died pending the writ.” This act was passed to facilitate the trial of ejectments, and has received a liberal construction.

(What we understand by the old purchase was the land within the purchase of 1754 and 1768, and by the new purchase the lands within the purchase of 1784, lying north of the west branch of the Susquehanna, and west of the Lycoming and Towanda creeks.) This agreement was the contract of the parties. We are unable to see any thing in that agreement inconsistent with these propositions. Both showed that Martin had failed to locate the twenty-five warrants of the 1st July, 1784, (the day the land-office first opened under the Commonwealth.) The legislature had reduced the price of land in the old purchase. The twenty-five warrants had cost. &lt;£10 per hundred acres; a credit could be had for them in the land-office; principal and interest, and new warrants obtained at 50 shillings per hundred acres. These propositions do not seem to have much bearing on the case. The agreement in pursuance of them is plain, clear, and explicit. The only argument that could be drawn from them was, that Martin said he was poor, and claimed the clemency of Mr. Morris. It was not wrong in the court, in this case, to receive the propositions that preceded the article in evidence. That one of the parties was poor and the other rich affords, no reason to change their contract.</p>

He said he would, and we agreed upon the terms—I was to have one-half. I then went and gave him a description of the property. I think I showed him that draft.

Deeds poll- to him; purchase-money paid me. Robert Martin. The over measure- to be cast up and accounted for.” There is no date, but to judge from the boldness and steadiness of the hand, the endorsement would seem to be made before the' writer had become paralyzed, and consequently a considerable time before his death. This memorandum is the-defendant’s title; and the question is, how is it to operate ? As a written agreement for a conveyance from Martin, or for conveyances directly from- the warrantees, which it is said equity would execute specifically, the iterms of the contract would be sufficiently stated to take it out of the statute of frauds. If the endorsement were a written agreement; that consequence would follow. But an agreement-is the. assent of two minds to the same thing; it requires that the written evidence - of-it, when it is reduced to writing, as well as the agreement itself, should be seen and assented to by both parties. It- is not merely a secret memorandum made by one of them for his private satisfaction, but it must be the evidence of the bargain-appointed hyboth; just as subscribing witnesses are appointed to attest-the-execution-of the instrument; It may be evidence by a letter sent from the one to the other, and accepted as well as acted upon as an offer of terms, or by <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>a receipt or memorandum sufficiently stating the conditions; but in these instances the paper is parted with as evidence of the thing agreed to.

In Plumstead’s Appeal, <a href="/serg-rawl/4/0545-01" class="citation" data-index="73" data-cite="4 Serg. &amp; Rawle 545" data-case-ids="1801974" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/4/0545-01">4 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 545</a>, an envelop containing several securities, and endorsed with the words and letters “For Rebecca Gore,” and another “for the heirs of George Plumstead,” in the handwriting of the deceased, never having been out of her possession, and without any communication made to any one on the subject, or any evidence to show at what time or for what purpose the endorsements were made; held, not to be of testamentary character. The attempt was, to procure it to be admitted to probate, because it was well known that it could have no effect in any other shape. It could not operate as evidence of a gift, to which delivery of the thing given was necessary to a note or a bond. But the principle of Charlewood <em>v. </em>The Duke of Bedford, 1 Atk. 497, that a writing, to be binding within the statute of frauds, must import the assent to it and <em>privity </em>of both the parties to be bound, is still more directly applicable to the case before us ; and there it was held, that a mere entry of contracts with tenants on a steward’s book is inadmissible as evidence of á contract for a lease. Yet the entry of the steward was the act of the principal; and the decision consequently was, that a private memorandum of an agreement on a man’s own book, is not sufficient to take it out of the statute. And why should this private memorandum on the back of a private draft have a greater effect ? It was held in Ayliffe <em>v. </em>Tracy, 2 <em>Peere </em>Wms. 65, that <em>the </em>proposal of a marriage portion sent in a letter to a third person is insufficient, unless it "was shown to the person who afterwards married the daughter.</p>

The utmost that can be allowed to it is that of an admission, that Robert Martin had previously sold the lands to Robert Morris, and that-he had received the consideration for'them; but an admission having ho more force than a verbal declaration. It is certainly not ah admission that he had sold them, and conveyed them by a writing signed by him; and it is necessary to give the endorsement an effect to that extent, in order-to take the case out of the statute. That there was a written conveyance, is a part of it to be established by the defendants, and the burden of proving it lies upon them. But the admission is barely that Martin had sold and received the purchase money; not that he had conveyed, which was the operative word in McDonald <em>v. </em>Campbell, <a href="/serg-rawl/2/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="74" data-cite="2 Serg. &amp; Rawle 473" data-case-ids="1798278" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/2/0473-01">2 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 473</a>. On this part of the case, that decision is a decisive authority for the plaintiffs. This interpretation of the endorsement is fortified by the words in <em>it—“ </em>deed-polls to him,”—the evident meaning of which is no more than that the déedspoll were to be mad'e from the nominal owners of the warrants directly to Robert Morris, instead of being made to Robert Martin, in order to be followed by a conveyance from Martin to Morris. ■ That they had not yet been made, is evident from the fact, that'some of them were outstanding long afterthe death of the original parties, and from the memorandum “ The over measure to be cast up and accounted for.” The endorsement, therefore, imports no more than there had been a verbal sale to Mr. Morris, and it is easy to conceive from the subsequent embarrassment arid ruin, why it'was riot consummated. It is probable that these tracts were intended to -be taken in place of an equal number covenanted to be located in Northumberland county; but it appears, that these parties, who seem to have dealt with each other pretty much upon honour, had changed the'terms of their agreerrient more than once, and it would be dangerous to say they had not done so again. It is -probable that-Mr. Martin did not comply with his covenant to locate the proper number of tracts in the county specified, or'with his verbal agreement to throw in the tracts in dispute to make up the deficiency; and'so far the estate of Mr. Morris may have been prejudiced; but it is too late to speculate on these matters. After the lapse of half a century, it is now too late to say what'would be just between the parties. If the endorsements had indicated that the deeds-poll were already made, a presumption of their loss might have arisen from lapse of time sufficient to justify an assumption that the title had <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>passed; but it imports no more than the existence, at one time, of a parol agreement executed in part only by payment of the price, which is insufficient to take it out of the statute of frauds.

It was <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>evidence to them that he was estopped from setting up his after-acquired title, having first induced others to expend their money in acquiring a title under Robert Morris by sheriff’s sale, in which title George Grant had an interest. It was not evidence to effect those who had no connection with the sheriff’s sale. The act of turpitude of George Grant could only effect those of the plaintiffs who w7ere actors with him.</p>

That the court erred in refusing to permit William Martin to testify that (in pursuahce of the agreement made by William Levan, one of the defendants with him, to give him $5000 if he would-procure the title of the heirs of Robert Martin) he procured deeds to himself from six of the heirs. That he executed a deed to Levan on terms conveying- the same to him, which was deposited as an escrow with William A. Lloyd, and to be delivered on the payment of the purchase money. That Levan surreptitiously, and without the payment of the purchase money; and in fraud of the agreement between the parties, obtained the deeds from' William A. Lloyd, put them bn record, and retained them without ever paying any consideration money as mentioned in the seventeenth bill of exceptions.</p>
    <p id="b428-4" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[326,1343,1182,527]]]'>The court very properly rejected all this offer, except that William Levan agreed to give $5000, if he would procure the title of the heirs of Robert Martin. This was admitted on the ground that it was notice that the-heirs of Robert Martin claimed the land. It was evidence for no other purpose; all the rest of the offer was raising a different issue than the one trying, as we-understand.the cause. The six heirs of Robert Martin, who had released, were not plaintiffs in this ejectment. Mr. Levan had a right to buy his peace. There was no issue trying between the releasing heirs and the defendants, and how that release was procured, was perfectly immaterial in the the.cause trying. . ' ■</p>

This offer also, “ to show that-the. creditors of Robert Morris had levies made, on all his property that could.be discovered,” was properly rejected.

The next error assigned is the admitting in evidence what purported to be-a copy of the dismissal or <em>supersedeas </em>of the commission of bankruptcy in the District Court .of the United States, for <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, as mentioned in the twentieth bill of exceptions.</p>
    <p id="b429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[174,508,1194,1601]]]'>' This question is of small consideratio'n in.the case before us, but being pressed on this court, an opinion is indispensable. The certificate of dismissal or <em>supersedeas </em>of the proceedings in bankruptcy is certified by the district judge, under his hand and his own private seal, (like a signature to a bond,) and the clerk of the court, uñdqr the seal of the court, certifies that he is the judge. The-district courts of the United States are courts of record, with exclusive civil and criminal jurisdiction. Every District Court has a clerk, whose duty it is to enter all things-judicially done by-the judge. 1 Story’s Laws U. S. 56. By. the act of Congress; 1790, (1 Story’s Laws, 67,) all writs from the court bear test of the judge, and are signed by the clerk with the seal of the court. The clerk is the keeper of the records and proceedings of the court. Under the bankrupt law of the 12th of April, 1800, sec. 2, (1 Story’s Laws, 733,) the proceedings commenced by petition to the district judge, on which the. district judge appointed commissioners. The proceedings were all in the District Court. The act of the 26th May, 1790, provides that the records and judicial proceedings of the state courts shall be proved by the attestation of the clerk, and the seal of the court annexed, if' there be a seal, together with the certificate of the judge that the attestation is in due form. Why should not the courts of the United States be held to the same rule'Congress has prescribed to the state courts. In this certificate the judge takes the place of the clerk, and the clerk of the judge. As Congress has not prescribed a rule of attestation to. their own courts,'we must resort to the common law rules. An office-copy of. a record is a copy authenticated by a person intrusted for that purpose ; it is admitted in evidence upon the credit of the officer, without proof that it has been actually examined. 1 Greenleaf Ev. sec. 507; <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Phillips%2C%20387" class="citation" data-index="75" data-cite="2 Phillips, 387">2 Phillips, 387</a>; Buller, N. P. 229. We think "the clerk is the keeper by law of the proceeding in bankruptcy in the District Court; and is the person to certify to their correctness-and verity, under the seal of the court, and the judge to certify that his attestation is in due form.</p>
    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[178,2113,1178,94]]]'>16, This assignment of error is not supported, nor has it been pressed on the court.</p>

He had certified the copy, with the seal of the surveyor-general’s office, and for the surveyor-general.- It was not Thomas J. Rehrer’s certificate, but the certificate of the proper officer. Such <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>certificates have been received in evidence in all the courts' of the state, since the office was first established by William Penn.</p>
    <p id="b430-3" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[325,544,1182,480]]]'>18. Several exceptions were taken to.the charge of the court. As the cause on another trial must assume an entire new appearance, we deem it unnecessary to notice the exceptions in detail; this court fully agree with the judge below, that the land-office of Pennsylvania demonstratively shows that the lands in question were entered and paid for by Robert Martin—that the title was in him. This court have given an opinion on the legal effect and operation of the endorsement on the draft so surreptitiously put in circulation. By that endorsement the title of Robert Martin is not divested, and a jury no doubt will be so instructed on another trial.</p>
