      <em>Oct. </em>16. The plaintiff in this ejectment derived title under warrants Nos. 3701, 3741, to Robert Morris, dated March 5th, 1793, which were surveyed in 1820. Morris, by his will in 1804, devised &lt;£ all the other property which I now possess or may hereafter acquire, whether real or personal, or all that shall belong to me at the time of my death,” to his wife,.Mary Morris, for life, to be disposed of as sbe pleases, at or before her death, ££ when, no doubt, she will make such a distribution amongst her children as she - may think proper.” Mrs. Morris, in 1824, devised all the residue of her real and personal estate whatsoever, including all she then had, or might hereafter acquire, to-- her daughter Maria Nixon. Her will further declared, “ and it is intended for my daughter’s sole and separate ufee, notwithstanding her marriage.” . In' 1824, Mrs. Nixon and her husband conveyed'to the plaintiff.- The admission of these wills, and the conveyance, to which'defendant objected, were the first three errors assigned.</p>

This presents the question, whether a devise •of all a man’s. “ property, real or personal,” passes a trust estate. . It is not admitted, that Morris had nothing more than a trust estate : but as the defendant’s evidence to that point was rejected, it is to be assumed here in argument' that it was so: There is nothing in. the character of a trust estate, that ought 'to exempt it from the general •■operation of a devise. It is an estate ; a thing of which a mah.is said to be seised; and has fixed and well-established legal properties. .'It'is not extinguished by the c(eath of the trustee, but descends as other estates, to the heir-at-law, and may be passed, by ■ deed <em>inter vivos. A </em>vendor, by'articles of agreement, is a trustee' for the vendee ; and this court has repeatedly decided, that a sale of his interest by the sheriff passes to the purchaser, not’ only the unpaid balance of the purchase money, but also the legal title., This, it is true, is a trust coupled with .an interest. The point, however ' doubtful it might once have been', has been decided in several, cases in England, and by the Court of Errors of New York. In Jackson <em>v. </em>Delaney,. <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Johns.%20555" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="13 Johns. 555">13 Johns. 555</a>, in .which the cases are 'collected, the Chancellor, in delivering the opinion of the court, says : “ The rule, as now settled, is this, that trust estates will pass by the usual general words in a will passing other estates,” &amp;e.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b229-9" data-blocks='[["BL_229.10",229,[215,2173,1182,288]],["BL_230.1",230,[311,415,1189,906]]]'>The next point presented by the counsel of the.plaintiffin error is, that assuming that trust estates will pass by general devises in a will, and that the trust in this case vested in.Mary Morris, and by her will was-transferred to Maria Nixon; yet “this estate being ‘ for the sole and separate use’ ” of .the devisee, she had not the power to convey. The case of Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, <a href="/rawle/1/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Rawle 231" data-case-ids="1819262" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0231-01">1 Rawle, </a><a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a><a href="/rawle/1/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Rawle 231" data-case-ids="1819262" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0231-01">231</a>, is-clearly distinguishable from the present case. In that case, •the <em>feme covert </em>had a mere equity, the legal estate being in trustees, who had pwer to' convey, with her assent. In our case,- the devise is of the legal estate to the <em>feme, </em>and if she cannot' convey, there is no means by which she can divest herself, or be divested of it. That devise was of a beneficial estate ; and it is contended, this is of a trust. Suppose she was called on- by the cestui' que trust to execute the trust ? how could she do it ? . If the. court, 'under the act-of the 16th June, 1836, Vaughan <em>v. </em>Barclay, 6 Whart; 392, were to decree that she convey to the. <em>cestui que'trust, </em>how could she do it? certainly, by deed. And can she not do that voluntarily which she could be compelled tó do. under a decree of the. court ? The authorities, therefore, seem to ■ sustain 'the court fully, that the legal estate vested in Maria Nixon, and that the deed from her husband and herself conveyed the title to the - plaintiff. It is further .worthy of remark, that the defendants in this case in no way claim under the persons whom they allege to be the .beneficial, owners, bu't are mere occupiers or trespassers, without title or any legal connection with the. title.</p>

It was, therefore, properly rejected. The only question at all doubtful is, whether the legal title passed to the plaintiff by the conveyance of Henr.y and Maria Nixon; for it is certain it passed by the will of Mr. Morris, under the devise -to Mrs. Morris, of all his property, réal and personal, which he then possessed, might acquire, or .should belong to him at his death; and that, it passed by her' will to Maria Nixon, for her separate use. That a chancellor would hold the husband to account for the pro-fits as a trustee, 'is undoubted. But in whom was the -legal title ? It certainly passed to Mrs. Morris’s daughter and devisee, Maria, or by implication to her husband, in order to prevent the' trust from failing, if, for that purpose, a separate depository of the legal title .were indispensáble. But whether it passed to the one.or the other, it passed to the plaintiff by their joint, deed, which was competent to pass the wife’s legal estate by the.'statute.,'and the husband’s legal estate by the common lawr. ’ Now, though Mrs. Nixon was incompetent to part with her beneficial estate, according to'the principles pf Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, she was competent to join in an act necessary <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>to change the trustee; and assuming that the beneficial, interest is still in her, the legal estate is .in the plaintiff, which, according to Cox <em>v. </em>Blandon, is"-all that is-necessary to 'enable him'to recover against an intruder. .’ . -, Judgment affirmed.</p>
