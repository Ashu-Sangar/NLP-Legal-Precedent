      <em>Oct. </em>29. Caldwell having been indicted for forgery, entered into a recognisance with Miller in $2500, conditioned for his appearance at the Quarter Sessions. On the same day, wdth the acknowledgment of this recognisance, Caldwell assigned to Miller all his interest in the principal of two judgments of said Caldwell against Summers, for $1313 62 and $1309 respectively, reserving to the assignor the accruing interest thereon. Annexed to this assignment was a condition reciting <em>•“ </em>that if the said Caldwell, for whom the said Miller has entered bail in a recognisance, shall be and appear at the next court,” &amp;c., and abide all orders, &amp;c., then the foregoing assignments should be <em>void; </em>and the prothonotary was authorized to enter the assignments of the principal sums due thereon on his docket.</p>

It was not intended that the defendant should make a job of the contract, or pocket any more than compensation and reimbursement. Stipulated damages can exist only by force of an unequivocal agreement to pay a specified sum, as liquidated satisfaction fixed beforehand by the parties. ,The assignment is in the nature of a penalty, against which the court below was as competent to relieve as a chancellor would be. Nor is the objection to the form of the action better founded. The agreement has been executed so far as it was executory; and it would puzzle a pleader to find in it any particular covenant for payment of the excess to the plaintiff. This was received as so much paid to his use¿ and assumpsit was consequently the proper action.</p>
