      <em>Sept. </em>28. On the trial of this .ejectment,, the plaintiff gave in evidence1 a deed to Clark, wdiose title he had, from Austin for ninety acres and one. hundred and fifty-three perches, and a survey made December 4, 1818; and proved that Austin first settled the land about twenty-five years before the trial. About six or eight acres, a part of the tract not now in dispute, were cleared, and" subsequently sold to another person. Clark afterwards built a house, cleared, fenced, and cultivated from three to five acresl A part of the meadow was occupied by one Hurst, since then the ninety, acres were said to have been occupied, but there was no actual occupancy for twenty-one years of that part in dispute in this cause, this clearing <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>not being on the land in dispute. About two years before the trial, the defendant entered and cut grass, and trees for firewood, but no timber was hauled away or sold. The defendant,, for the purpose of proving the situation of the south line of the donation tract, No. 140, gave in evidence a patent for a tract to one Marshall, which called for No. .140 as a boundary. He then proved a survey made for himself of the tract No. 140, about sixteen years before the trial, the lines of which ran some eight or nine rods into the clearing made by Clark, but, in consequence of the dispute, the surveyor, who appears to have been employed for that purpose, said he divided the land among Hatch’s sons, stopping at the clearing—supposing the matter would be settled among the parties. Another of the witnesses employed in this survey stated that Clark had cleared and occupied the meadow and the ground in dispute, for sixteen or seventeen years.</p>

      <em>“ </em>How does plaintiff seek to prevent the effect of the titles under the two older surveys ? He claims to have had actual adverse possession by himself and those under whom he claims of the disputed territory for more than twenty-one years, clearing, cultivating, and residing on it, paying taxes for it all this time. His survey was made in 1818, and if you believe the testimony, there has been an uninterrupted possession of it since, by the plaintiff and his ven-, dors. There-has been no entry nor claim whatever on it, by the owners of. the Mifflin warrant. . As to them, therefore,, the possession has- been -actual, adverse, -and continued for twenty-one years. The statute of limitations will confer a good title. The Mifflin tract was vacant during all this time,, at least no possession is shown.</p>

Whether the lines of the adjoining-lots, Nos. 140 and 440 interfered, is of no sort of consequence, inasmuch as Isaiah Clarke, under whom the plaintiff claims, held the adverse possession,' as the jury have found, of part of both tracts, and therefore he-has a right to the protection of the act of limitation against the owners of one or both those tracts; and those who claim under them.
