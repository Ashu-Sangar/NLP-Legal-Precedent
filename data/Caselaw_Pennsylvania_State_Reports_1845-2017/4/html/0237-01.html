This was an action of trespass against a collector of taxes for selling the propérty of defendant under a warrant. The plaintiff proved the seizure of a horse and saddle, four or six miles from his residence, by defendant claiming under a warrant against Robinson, and a sale at the house of the collector after advertisement. The defendant gave in evidence the duplicate of the assessment" of Robinson’s property, for 1843, consisting of a tract of land with a saw’ and grist-mill, and five other' tracts, together with one .mare and a cow valued at $40, and $10 respectively, the total valuation of which property was $2901, and the tax assessed $29 00. <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>Also a warrant signed by the commissioners. He then proved that defendant-resided with Robinson and others, at the mill tract, the title of which Robinson claimed. Also that defendant, Robinson and the others, had said in each -other’s presence, that they were to have the' mills and privilege of using the timber on all the lands for three years. The plaintiff gave evidence that the several tracts of land were separated from each other a considerable distance, and that Robinson claimed exclusive title, and was in exclusive possession of some of them. He also- gave evidence that defendant had previously levied under the warrant, on some boards of Robinson, which were.delivered up for that purpose by plaintiff, but on cross-examination the witness stated, (and there was other evidence to the same effect,) that they were given up on proof they belonged to a stranger. He further proved the value of the saddle and bridle was from $3 to $5. The defendant had given notice to produceAhe lease of the property. The plaintiff then offered to prove by his own oath that the lease between plaintiff, Robinson and.others had been deposited with 'Fitsimmons, who now resided in Tennesseej f°r the purpose of introducing parol evidence of its contents, but the court rejected the evidence. The- defendant then proved the property sold.for $26, and the purchaser, four or five days after, sold the maré for that sum. It was admitted that the seizure was for the entire amount of the assessed taxes.</p>

    <p id="b240-6" data-blocks='[["BL_240.10",240,[342,1281,1175,129]]]'>The main question raised was, whether the property of Montgomery could be distrained 'and levied for the taxes assessed on these lands.</p>

But the court very properly refused to give this instruction. It cannot, be pretended that by the use of-the word distress, the legislature intended to give the levy of a collector of taxes all the incideirts of a distress for rent. It is more in the nature of an execution ; and the words levy and distress are used in the statute, so as to exhibit an intent to make them equivalent, and of the same import. It might as well, on the same ground, be contended that a collector was bound to. put up notice on the premises, wait five'days for a repie<a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>vin, then have the property valued, and so on through all the formula, but the process would be so cumbrous as to be inconsistent with public policy, and therefore not within the intent of the legislature.</p>
    <p id="b241-4" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[203,609,1184,516]]]'>There is no analogy between the cases'. The landlord, without the staff of office, or ministerial authority, proceeds on his own responsibility, and for his own benefit, and it is therefore necessary to bind him up to the strictest rules of the ancient distress. But the collector is a public officer clothed with the mantle of authority, acting for the benefit of the public, and without whose services the wheels of government would stop. He has to do with all sorts and conditions of people; is obliged to encounter the prejudices and passions of his neighbours, and unless he goes clearly beyond the range of his warrant, he ought to be protected by the law, whose servant he is.</p>
    <p id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[203,1142,1184,1106]]]'>With the tracts of land there was also assessed to John Robinson a mare and a cow, both valued at <em>$50. </em>The plaintiff’s counsel requested the court to charge the jury that this circumstance made the defendant a trespasser. The court declined to give the instruction. The whole assessment of John Robinson amounted to $29; the proportion of the mare and cow would be from the apparent rate of assessment, 50 cents. . The mare levied on by the collector sold for $26, an amount not sufficient to pay the assessed tax on the real estate. It would appear that there was no sacrifice of property by the sale ; for the purchaser of the mare sold her the next day at the same price; nor is there any unfairness alleged in the sale. The plhintiff therefore suffered no wrong, if he was the occupant of the six tracts of land; which question was fairly submitted to the jury, and found against him. It does not appear that the collector specified the tax on the personal estate, as composing part of the sum for which he levied, nor that he demanded that tax specifically from Montgomery, nor that Montgomery objected particularly to that part, but that his objection was to the payment of any part of the tax, assessed in the name of John Robinson. The only evidence that the collector included in his levy the amount of the personal tax, was in the duplicate which he produced himself, but that indeed, under the circumstances, was no evidence at all, as he did not levy enough to pay the tax on the realty.</p>
