From the birth of the common law down to the Act of 1848, it is admitted such an action would not lie; but, says the learned counsel, “ we start with the Act of 1848 in a new era; with fresh necessities; with <em>rights </em>created by the act itself, requiring new remedies, and turning- the old common law <a id="p398" href="#p398" data-label="398" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*398</a>doctrines, decisions, fictions, and ■ absurdities, into fossil remains, dead as mummies, and, what is commendable, without mourners.”</p>
    <p id="b398-6" data-blocks='[["BL_398.4",398,[276,510,1177,289]]]'>This is a spirited defence of an anomalous action, and it is worthy of consideration how far it is sound. We have not been in the habit of considering the Act of 1848 as inaugurating a new era. The marriage relation, as old as the human race, and the basis of- the family, which is itself the basis of society and civil states, has always been sedulously guarded and cherished by the «common law.</p>
    <p id="b398-7" data-blocks='[["BL_398.5",398,[295,806,1153,427]]]'>One of the favourite maxims of the common law is, that marriage makes the man and woman one person in law, and of course it excludes the possibility of a civil suit between them. Now this characteristic of the contract may be considered a fiction, an absurdity, a fossil, or whatever else the necessities of the new era may denominate it, but it is in exact accordance with the revealed will of Grod, was designed for the protection of the woman, and leads to that identification of sympathies and interests, which secures to families and neighbourhoods the blessings of harmony and good order.</p>
    <p id="b398-8" data-blocks='[["BL_398.6",398,[293,1231,1149,384]]]'>It is doubtless competent for the legislative power to change and modify the qualities of the marriage relation, perhaps to abolish it altogether; but if the history of the human race teaches any lesson whatever, it is, that concubinage is the alternative of marriage. In just so far as you impair the one, you encourage the other. In just so far as you sever the material interests of husband and wife, you destroy the sympathies which constitute the oneness of the relation, and degrade the divine institution to mere concubinage.</p>
    <p id="b398-9" data-blocks='[["BL_398.7",398,[290,1614,1150,372]]]'>Nothing could so complete that severance and degradation, as to throw open litigation to the parties. The maddest advocate for woman’s rights, and for the abolition on earth of all divine institutions, could wish for no more decisive blow from the courts than this. The flames which litigation would kindle on the domestic hearth would consume in an instant the conjugal bond, and bring on a new era indeed — an era of universal discord, of unchastity, of bastardy, of dissoluteness, of violence, cruelty, and murders. '</p>
    <p id="b398-10" data-blocks='[["BL_398.8",398,[290,1996,1149,171]]]'>But will the courts expose this fundamental relation to the consequences of unbridled litigation ? Never. If it is to be done, it must be by the legislature, and then by no indirection, or inferential consequence, but by direct, plain, unmistakable English.</p>

If the legislature meant that such actions as the present should be sustained, they had command of a very copious language in which to express their will. They have not done it. <a id="p399" href="#p399" data-label="399" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*399</a>and, until they do, we will not infer it. When it is done, the consequences must rest with those who do it.</p>
    <p id="b399-6" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[158,497,1166,477]]]'>The object of the Act of 1848 was to protect the wife’s separate property from the creditors of the husband. This was accomplished before the act, by means of marriage settlements; but occasional instances of hardship occurred, which, magnified by that prurient philanthropy that begins its work where the wise and good leave off, and demolishes what they build up, led a too susceptible legislature into declaring not only that the wife’s property should be exempt from seizure by the husband’s creditors, but that it should continue to be her property “ as fully after her marriage as before,” and should be “owned, used, and enjoyed by such married woman as her own separate property.”</p>
    <p id="b399-7" data-blocks='[["BL_399.5",399,[152,975,1171,430]]]'>It was this language that led Judge Rogers to declare, in Cummings’ Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20275" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Jones 275">1 <em>Jones </em>275</a>, that a married woman must hereafter be considered a <em>feme sole </em>in regard to any estate of whatever name or sort, owned by her before marriage. To that extent, the Act of 1848 tends, undoubtedly, to the destruction of the marriage relation. Marriage makes her a <em>feme covert, </em>suspends her civil existence, is a gift of her personal estate in possession' to the husband, and of her power to reduce her choses in ■action into possession, and entitles.him to the custody of her person and the enjoyment of her earnings.</p>
    <p id="b399-8" data-blocks='[["BL_399.6",399,[155,1405,1167,250]]]'>The act makes her a <em>feme sole </em>in respect to her property, and confers rights utterly inconsistent with the duties of the marriage relation ; for whilst she uses and enjoys her own estate as a <em>feme sole, </em>it is impossible that she can be fulfilling all the duties of a <em>feme covert. </em>It is, that far, a permanent severance of the material interests of the relation.</p>
    <p id="b399-9" data-blocks='[["BL_399.7",399,[155,1665,1166,430]]]'>Ten years is not a long time to test the value of any revolutionary movement, but it may be seriously doubted whether the family discords, and the litigation to which this well-meant provision has given rise, are not sufficient to condemn it. It was not necessary to the main object of the enactment. The husband’s creditors might have been restrained, without restraining the husband from all enjoyment of the wife’s estate; and to guard against improvident use, he might have been required to make adequate settlements on his wife, or to give security to a trustee for her benefit and protection.</p>
    <p id="b399-10" data-blocks='[["BL_399.8",399,[154,2095,1164,246]]]'>But to emancipate her from the conjugal vow, even to the extent of her separate estate, wise or unwise as it may have been, was not to confer on her a right of action against her husband. It is said she could not own, use, and enjoy her property, without the right of action, and hence it is argued that the legislature of 1848 meant to confer all the means which were essential to the end in view.</p>

The latter act provides that “ <em>any </em>suit or suits at law hereafter to be commenced, touching or concerning, or for the recovery of any property, real, personal, or mixed, belonging or secured to any married woman by virtue of the provisions of the act relating to the rights of married women, passed the 11th day of April 1848, may be brought in the names of such married woman and her husband, to the use of the said married woman.”</p>

That this act .was intended to take away the separate action of either party, and restore the common law rule, is shown by what was very carefully said by this court in Keeney <em>v. </em>Good, 9 <em>Harris </em>356.</p>

In these cases the action, if the husband be the defendant, shall be in the name of a next friend.</p>

To the defendant’s plea of coverture, the plaintiff replied the desertion of her by the defendant, which he denied, and thus an issue of fact was formed. The evidence on the point was contradictory ; but, instead of submitting it to the jury, the court withdrew this issue, and ruled, as matter of law, that the plaintiff was entitled to her action.</p>
