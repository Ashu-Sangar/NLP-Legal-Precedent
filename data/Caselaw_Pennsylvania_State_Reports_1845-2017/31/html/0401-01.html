Where the question is whether a possession is clear or mixed, some regard is to be had to the situation of the parties to he affected by the possession. -The two Heans, father and son, both in possession of the acre lot at the same time, a' stranger, a purchaser or a creditor, might naturally enough confound them as a joint possession under the same right. As to such a party, it would be a mixed possession. But not so as to Maulfair. He was the landlord of the elder Hean, and .the vendor of the younger. Though the lot contracted to the latter was not fenced off from the rest, it was designated by boundaries which Maulfair understood perfectly; and living in the immediate neighbourhood, and assisting Hean, Jr., to build a house on the purchased part, he could not possibly he mistaken about the fact of Hean, Jr.’s, exclusive possession, or the extent of it. If, in any sense, and as to any party, it was a mixed, confused, or uncertain possession, it was, as to Maulfair, a clear and exclusive possession, and therefore he might have been compelled, on payment of the purchase-money, to convey the title. »</p>

When, therefore, Maulfair brought suit in 1853, Hean’s mistake consisted in setting up nothing but the Ashmead title in defence. He ought to have alleged the parol agreement with Maulfair, and offered performance on his own part. Instead of this he suffered Maulfair to recover, in ejectment, to execute a writ of possession, and then attorned to him fully by taking a lease from him and renewing it.</p>
    <p id="b405-6" data-blocks='[["BL_405.4",405,[102,757,1164,932]]]'>Now this was letting go the equities under which he entered (7 <em>Harris </em>471); and no chancellor would, after that, compel specific execution of the parol sale. The learned judge said, if on that trial Hean had set up his parol title, a judgment against him would probably have concluded him; but why would not abandonment conclude his equities just as effectually as unsuccessful defence ? A man in possession of land under a parol contract, obliged to seek the aid of a court of equity to perfect his right, is bound to be vigilant and prompt. The active duties are all on him. Not only must he maintain his possession, but he must show himself ready, willing, and eager to perform the contract on his part. It is in behalf of such purchasers, courts of equity decree specific performance. But if he delays to pay the purchase-money, suffers the vendor to recover in ejectment, and then takes a lease from him, thereby changing utterly the character of his possession, and estopping himself from denying the vendor’s title, he has no longer any equities to assert. It would be a curious administration of the statute of frauds and perjuries to set aside a written lease in behalf of a prior parol contract. An odd decree for equity to make, that a man was in possession under a valid parol purchase, whilst he himself says in writing that he was in merely as a renter.</p>
