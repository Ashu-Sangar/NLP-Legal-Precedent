But in that case the constitution of the society expressly authorized such assessments from time to time, as might be required. In the case before us, there appears to be no express provision of that kind, but the principle seems to be a just one that the members of incorporated companies are bound to fulfil the obligations of the corporation itself, whenever their responsibility is not restricted by the charter; as it may be by express provision ascertaining the amount of capital stock, or the measure of liability: 1 <em>Am. Law Mag. </em>100. The members are not directly responsible to the creditors of the corporation, but, when they authorize it to contract debts for their benefit, they are each bound in conscience to contribute to the corporation itself a just proportion of the funds necessary to meet the engagements thus made. And a court of equity will give effect to this obligation, by compelling the corporate authorities to make the necessary <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>assessment. This seems to have been done in the case of Salmon <em>v. </em>The Hamburg Company, 1 <em>Cas. Ch. </em>206; 6 <em>Viner Abr. </em>310. That decision was cited with approbation by Ch. J. Spencer, in Slee <em>v. </em>Bloomer, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20Johns.%20484" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="19 Johns. 484">19 <em>Johns. </em>484</a>, and by Chancellor Dessaussure, in Hume <em>v. </em>Winyaw and Wando Canal Company, 1 <em>Carolina Law Journal </em>217; 7 <em>Am. Law Mag. </em>92. In the latter case there was a decree applying the proceeds of the joint stock towards the payment of the debt, and compelling each member to pay his proportion of the deficiency. That decree was affirmed on appeal, 7 <em>Am. Law Mag. </em>103. In the case before us, there seems to be no express provision ascertaining the amount of the capital, or otherwise restricting the measure of each member’s liability. But it may not be necessary to determine this point at present, as, if the members are not liable to assessment to meet liabilities incurred by their authority and for their benefit, it would seem to follow that the provision for the witness himself depends altogether upon the sufficiency of the corporate fund. As the recovery by the relator would diminish that fund, the witness was interested in defeating it. He was therefore properly excluded.</p>
