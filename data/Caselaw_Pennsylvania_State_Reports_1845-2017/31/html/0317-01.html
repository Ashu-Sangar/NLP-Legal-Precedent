By the terms of the act of incorporation, the company had three years within which to commence the road; and ten years within which to complete it. The payment of the stock, severally subscribed by the stockholders, was a condition precedent to the completion of the road. The agreement of the stockholders with each other, upon their subscribing to the capital stock of the company, was to pay their stock according to the terms of subscription; and the money to be appropriated to the construction of the road. It is contrary to reason and common sense, and it is certainly not law, for a stockholder who has subscribed to the capital stock of a public improvement, to ask that the improvement be completed before he pays the money, which he has subscribed for the very purpose of making it.</p>

This company has obtained an Act of Assembly to excuse them from one of the <em>termini; </em>and the jury have found that they now refuse to make the road to that <em>terminus. </em>They are, therefore, asking to enforce a contract, of which they refuse to perform one of the conditions. They want to enforce the payment of the subscription, in order to apply the money to a different enterprise from the one subscribed to. They have altered the contract duty which they were to perform for and by the stock, and yet wish to enforce, unaltered, the correlative duty. This, of course, cannot be done. The Act of Assembly was not intended to impair or alter the contract of subscription; but only to relieve the company from a part of its public duty.</p>
