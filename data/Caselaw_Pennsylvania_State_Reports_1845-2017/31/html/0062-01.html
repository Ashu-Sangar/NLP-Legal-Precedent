      <em>On </em>the 19th day of April 1866, Joseph S. Morrison, administrator of David Wilson, deceased, presented his petition to the court, setting forth that the personal estate was insufficient for the payment of the debts of the decedent, &amp;c., and praying the court for an order to sell a certain tract of four and a half acres of land, and twenty-one acres of coal under land adjacent thereto. The court granted an order to sell the same, on the 9th day of June 1856; the terms being one-half the purchase-money to be paid on the confirmation of the sale, and the residue in one year thereafter, with interest.</p>

Whereupon an order was granted to sell the same on the 20th of May 1857.</p>

On the 13th July, the administrator made return that he had sold the farm, containing <em>ninety-eight acres, </em>and the eighty-one acres of coal land, to James Wall at $50 per acre, amounting to $8950.</p>

The allegation of the purchaser is, that unless personal notice was given to the heirs, and particularly to minors, the administrator’s deed, made under the decree of the Orphans’ Court confirming the sale, would not pass a good title. But in this he is mistaken. This court decided, in Weaver’s Appeal, 7 <em>Harris </em>416, that where public notice was given of the sale, under the provisions of the fifty-fourth section of the Act of 29th March 1832, the proceedings were regular and valid. In the present case, all appear to have had notice of the sale that were interested as heirs, and desire its confirmation. The purchaser will unquestionably take the title the decedent held at his death, and that is all he bargained for.</p>

Several other objections were made in the Orphans’ Court to the confirmation of the sale in the case in hand, but they were not pressed upon the argument in this court, and would not have availed the appellant if they had been.</p>
