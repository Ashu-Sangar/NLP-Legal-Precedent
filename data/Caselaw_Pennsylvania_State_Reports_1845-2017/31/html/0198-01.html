The law does not allow one man to kill another, no matter under what circumstances of provocation he may have committed the act. A homicide thus perpetrated, is neither excusable nor justifiable, but the law, in mercy, reduces the offence from that of murder to voluntary manslaughter; though, should one kill another suddenly, without any or a considerable provocation, the law implies malice, and the killing is murder; but if the provocation were great, the offence would be manslaughter, and not murder.</p>

Yet, this must be taken with some grains of allowance. If a man should kill a woman or a child for a slight blow, the provocation would be no justification.’ And the same eminent judge has also said, ‘ when a blow is cruel or unmanly, the provocation will not excuse it; and the same law exists where there was a previous quarrel, and the killing was on an old grudgeCommonwealth <em>v. </em>Mosler, 4 <em>Barr </em>268. Stedman’s Case has been referred to by the counsel for the prisoner; now Chief Justice Gibson has shaken the authority of the decision in that case, by his remarks upon it in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Mosler, already cited, for he says: £ Under this view of the'law, I have always doubted Stedman’s Case, in which, for a woman’s blow on the face with an iron patten, given to a soldier in return for words of gross provocation, he gave her a blow with the pommel of his sword on her breast, and then ran after her and stabbed her in the back, and the crime was held to be only manslaughter.’ It is, perhaps, unnecessary to add anything to the opinion of the late chief justice thus expressed; and yet, as living judges, we are bound to say that we entirely concur in it.</p>

But no matter what may have been the provocation, if there be sufficient time for the passion to subside, and for reason to interpose, called in the law <em>‘ </em>cooling time,’ the homicide will be murder, either in the first or second degree, as the jury, from the evidence, believe the blow to have been inflicted wilfully, deliberately, and premeditatedly, with intent to take life, or simply with malicious intent to do great bodily harm. What is sufficient cooling time, has never been definitely determined by judicial interpretation or decision, ■and the question must be settled by the circumstances attending each particular ease. It has been said, that the time in which an ordinary man, under or in like circumstances, would have cooled, may be said to be reasonable time, and this rule we adopt in the present case. If the prisoner is lashed into ungovernable passion by recent provocation, <em>so strong </em>as to destroy all self-control, and is not the master of his own understanding;’ and if, in this condition of mind, he inflicts a blow, from which death ensues, with an instrument which happens to be near him, or in his possession, the offence will clearly be but manslaughter.</p>

If two combats rapidly succeed each other, the question, how far the grade of the offence, apparently committed in the 'second combat, will be mitigated by the previous combat, will depend, first, upon the view which the jury take of the two combats, being in fact but one and the same; and, secondly, upon the view which the jury may take of the first combat, having been so recent as to have furnished a reasonable and sufficiently strong and sudden provocation for either a second combat, or for a subsequent attack, producing a contest not entitled to be called a mutual combat.</p>

But when a doubt suggests itself to your minds, as to the prisoner’s guilt, upon the facts of the case, as presented by the evidence, the law casts the whole weight of the prisoner’s former good character in mercy’s scale, and settles the question in favour of the accused. • What then is a doubt ? It is not sufficient for the prosecution to establish a probability, the evidence must establish the truth to a reasonable certainty; it must convince and direct the understanding, and satisfy the reason and judgment of those who are bound to act conscientiously upon it; a doubt, such as the law recognises, is not a figment of the imagination, but something, which, upon a candid and conscientious examination of the evidence in the case, would lead a man of common sense, if he were dealing with the ordinary business of life, and in his own affairs, seriously to pause before coming to a conclusion.

The doubt was not without reason. Personally we know that Judges Ludlow and Allison are associate justices of the Court of Common Pleas, learned in the law, and that neither of them is the president of that court. Yet can we judicially take notice of the fact, that neither of them is the president of that court, when the defendant did not deny it by plea, and when the record does not show it; but, on the contrary, avers that the trial took place at a court of Oyer and Terminer ? Doubtless, there are many things of public interest, things which ought generally to be known, of which courts will take notice without proof. Rut whether a superior court is bound to know who are the judges of subordinate courts, and what is the nature of their commissions, is by no means clearly settled. In the English courts, it has been held, that such facts a court cannot be presumed to know. In Skipp <em>v. </em>Hooke, 2 <em>Strange </em>1080, a writ of error from the King’s Bench to the Common Pleas, it appeared that the placita was for the end of the term, before Sir John Willes and his brethren: the writ was returned, “ Teste Philip, Lord Hardwick.” It was objected that the writ ought to bear teste in the name of Sir John Willes. To which it was answered that though the court had a private knowledge who was Chief Justice of the Common Bench at that time, yet they could not judicially take notice of it, and Lord Hardwick might be Chief Justice in Easter term when the writ issued. Besides, it was an exception to reverse a judgment, in which case the court will never go out of the record, and that the proper place to take advantage of irregularity was by motion in the Common Bench. Of this <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>opinion was the court, and the judgment was affirmed.

The objection is, that the constitution makes the presence of the President of the Common Pleas, essential to the existence of a court of Oyer and Terminer. We shall be aided in our examination of this objection, by a reference to the constitution of 1790, as well as to the amended one of 1838. The fifth article of the constitution of 1790, section 4th, provided for the establishment of Courts of Common Pleas. It ordained that <em>until it should be otherwise directed by </em>law, the several Courts of Common Pleas should be established in the following manner. The governor should appoint in each county not fewer than three, nor more than four judges. The state should be divided by law into circuits, none of which should include more than six, nor fewer than three counties. A president judge should be appointed in each circuit. The president and judges, any two of whom should be a quorum, should <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>compose the respective Courts of Common Pleas. The fifth section of the same article ordained in these words: <em>“ </em>The judges of the Courts of Common Pleas in each county, shall, by virtue of their offices, be justices of Oyer and Terminer and general gaol delivery, for the trial of capital and other offenders therein. Any two of the said judges, the <em>president </em>being one, shall be a quorum.” Two things are noticeable in this constitution. It made provision <em>de novo </em>for the establishment and organization of the Courts of Common Pleas, and it does not appear to have been contemplated that any other judges of those courts than the president might be learned in the law. Indeed the phrase “ learned in the law” is not to be found in the instrument. Although the establishment and mode of organization of the Courts of Common Pleas were thus prescribed, yet the constitution recognised the power of the legislature to make changes in both. Accordingly, such changes were made, without objection. The legislature reduced the number of judges in each county to two. They formed circuits containing less than three counties. They enacted that there should be four judges of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, that one of the associates should be a judge learned in the law, and that such an associate might hold a court alone, although two other judges might be holding court at the same time. The same power was also conferred upon the president judge, and this, notwithstanding the provision of the constitution of 1790, that “ the president and judges, any two of whom should be a quorum, shall compose the respective Courts of Common Pleas.” This legislation was not. supposed to be in conflict with the constitution, but was regarded as fully authorized by the provision that the Courts of Common Pleas should be established as designated, <em>until it should he otherwise directed hy law.</em>

When the constitution was made, it was not contemplated, that any other than the presidents, would be law judges, for as has been said, the phrase, learned in the law, is not used in the instrument. The purpose of the framers was, therefore, accomplished, by the provision, that the president should be one of the quorum. Yet, as has already been observed, the legislature were empowered to enact other directions, respecting the establishment of the several Courts of Common Pleas.</p>

The first section of the fifth article remains unchanged. The second section makes provision for the appointment, tenure, and compensation of the judges. The third section is as follows: — “ Until <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>otherwise directed by law, the Courts of Common Pleas shall continue as at present established. Not more than five counties shall, at any time, be included in one judicial district for said courts.” The fifth section is a transcript of the same section in the constitution of 1790. It ordains, that the judges of the Court of Common Pleas, in each county, shall, by virtue of their offices, be justices ■ of Oyer and Terminer and general gaol delivery, for the trial of capital and other offences therein. Any two of the said judges, the president being one, shall be a quorum. The present constitution did not, like the former, attempt to establish Courts of Common Pleas. It adopted those already in existence, subject, as they had always been, to the power of the legislature to make changes in their organization as well as in their powers. What constitutes a quorum, belongs to the organization, and the legislature has the same power over it, under the amended constitution, that they had under the former. .Under that, as we have seen, they made one judge competent to hold a Court of Common Pleas, and their action was not denied to be constitutional. It is not easy to see, why the number of judges, two, is not as necessary to form a constitutional quorum, as is the presence of the president judge. Yet it will -not be questioned, that the legislature can constitutionally so modify the Courts of Common Pleas as to increase or diminish the number of associate judges, and increase the number necessary to form a quorum.</p>

D. 1840, an Act of Assembly was passed providing for the establishment of the Court of General Sessions for the city and county of Philadelphia. Upon this court, were conferred all the powers and privileges which belong to the courts of Oyer and Terminer in the several counties of this Commonwealth. The second section enacted, that any one of the'judges should have full power and authority to hold the said court for the trial of all indictments (excepting in cases of homicide, when there should be two of the said judges).</p>

The second section of the act directed the appointment of an additional associate judge of the Court of Common Pleas, who should be learned in the law. This was done, and the constitution of the court was thus changed. The number of associates was increased from two to three, and all of them were law judges. The third section provided that the Court of Oyer and Terminer, &amp;c., of Philadelphia, thus con<a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>stituted, should hold six terms in each year.

The act is not an attempt to establish a new court, which the legislature are authorized to do by the first section of the fifth article: If it be valid at all it is because it is a reorganization of the existing Court of Common Pleas, under the clause of the constitution which ordains, that “the Courts of Common Pleas shall continue as at present established, <em>until otherwise directed ly law." </em>The plaintiff in error denies that the act is constitutional. We cannot regard this as an open question. Whatever doubts we might have, were the question <em>res nova </em>(and, speaking for myself, I should have many), we are not now at liberty to entertain them. The validity of this Act of Assembly, as well as the intent of the constitutional provisions, have heretofore been authoritatively defined. In Commonwealth Zephon, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="33" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 382" data-case-ids="483397" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0382-01">8 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>382</a>, the enactment was ruled to be constitutional, and it was held, that in the city and county of Philadelphia, a Court of Oyer and Terminer may be properly holden by two associate judges of the Court of Common Pleas. That case has since been repeatedly recognised as binding authority. See Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Martin, 2 <em>Barr </em>244; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Ford, 5 <em>Barr </em>209; Northern Liberty Hose Company, 1 <em>Harris </em>196. It has also been followed by practical consequences. In reliance upon it, the Oyer and Terminer of Philadelphia has continued to be constituted by two associate judges. Before such courts we are informed indictments for homicide have been tried, and there have been numerous convictions. In some of the cases, sentence of death has been passed and executed, and in others, the convicts are now undergoing imprisonment. It is too late for us to declare The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Zephon is all wrong, and that the act of 1843 was in conflict with the constitution. Adopting the language of the court in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Martin, nothing less than an imperative case would justify us in disregarding an act of the legislature at the expense of throwing open the jails and turning loose upon the community the malefactors convicted in a course of years.</p>

It is not necessary that they should be stated at the time to be so made: 1 <em>Grreenleaf Ev. </em>158. It is enough, if it satisfactorily appears, in any mode, that they were made under that sanction; whether it be directly proved, by the express language of the declarant, or be inferred from his evident danger, or the opinions of the medical or other attendants stated to him, or from his conduct, or other circumstances of the case, all of which are resorted to in order to ascertain the state of the declarant’s mind. When the declarations admitted here were made, the proof is, that McCracken, the declarant, appeared to be in a dying condition, as if he could not live many minutes. He said he was in a dying condition, and that he would never get up, and made arrangements for his burial. Surely, this was sufficient evidence of a sense of impending dissolution.

Such, however, has been the uniform construction given to the act, from the time of its enactment to the present day. Very early after its passage, in 1795, the case of Mulatto Bob was tried before Chief Justice McKean, and his associate, Judge Smith, two of the three judges of the Supreme Court, and in it the court declared their sense of the true meaning of the Act of 1794, corresponding with the doctrine of Judge Rush, and with <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>that given to the jury in this ease.

Nor is it at all certain that even the isolated sentence in the charge, to which exception was taken, was not entirely correct. It was not a binding direction, and could not have been so understood by the jury. The question which they subsequently addressed to the court shows that they did not so understand it. The killing of McCracken by the prisoner was admitted; the killing with a deadly weapon was admitted. There was no pretence that the wound was not designedly given. The intent to take life was presumable from the nature of the weapon used. The offence must therefore have been murder in the first degree, or manslaughter, as the jury might find that it was committed deliberately and premeditatedly, or in hot blood.

The substance of the charge was, that the law permitted evidence of good character to be submitted to the jury (of course for their consideration) in every case of homicide, no matter what might be the other testimony in the cause, and that when a doubt arises as to the guilt of the accused, such doubt was conclusive in his favour.
