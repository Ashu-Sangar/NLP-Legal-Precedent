At the time of the sale by Jackson in 1833, a survey was made by running the exterior lines of about 12,000 acres including the Mary Fred tract.

Timber for the mill and for coaling purposes was cut on various part of the land, and the taxes have been regularly paid by Savage since his purchase.

The case of Strimpfler <em>v. </em>Roberts has, therefore, nothing to do with the question. But the general principle on .which that case is founded has much to do with it; and that applies to both legal and equitable claims. It is the principle that lapse of time strengthens the title of the possessor and weakens that of a mere claimant. Long possession is inconsistent with unacknowledged claims, and a continual challenge of their validity.</p>
