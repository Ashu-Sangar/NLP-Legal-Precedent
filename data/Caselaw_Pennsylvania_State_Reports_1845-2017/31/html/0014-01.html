The plea was <em>non assumpsit. </em>On the trial the plaintiff had a verdict for $10 ; and afterwards the court dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction in the justice of the peace, and this is the matter complained of.</p>

R. </em>292; a case which has twice before been misunderstood: <a href="/watts/7/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts 170" data-case-ids="1846834" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0170-01">7 <em>Watts </em>170</a> ; 12 <em>State R. </em>381. All that is decided there is, that a justice of the peace has no jurisdiction of an action of <em>tort </em>for such negligence where the claim is over $100. No one doubts that <em>assumpsit </em>will lie in such a case; for the law implies a contract for care and skill, not as a fiction, but as a fact, from the “ understanding,” 13 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>44, or “ course of dealing between the parties;" 17 <em>Id. </em>371; <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20387" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts 387">6 <em>Watts </em>387</a>. This declaration is plainly in <em>assumpsit. </em>And certainly, when the law gives jurisdiction to justices “ of all causes of action arising from contract, express or implied,” it means to include such cases as this; else an action for carelessly soldering a tin bucket would be beyond the judicial competence of a justice. Other analogous cases show plainly enough that the justice has jurisdiction. <a href="/watts/6/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Watts 47" data-case-ids="1846101" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0047-01">6 Watts 47</a>; 7 <em><a href="/watts/6/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Watts 47" data-case-ids="1846101" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0047-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/watts/6/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Watts 47" data-case-ids="1846101" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0047-01">175, 542</a>.</p>
