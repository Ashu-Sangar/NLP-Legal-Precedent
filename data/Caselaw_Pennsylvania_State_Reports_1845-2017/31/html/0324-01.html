He left them in possession of the defendants, and when he sold to Mrs. Speicher, he permitted them to unite the legal title with the actual possession. I say the legal title, for, although the sale was made on a condition precedent, which was not complied with, and the title would not have vested, <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>had the condition been insisted on, yet it is manifest the condition was waived, and the title permitted to vest.</p>

    <p id="b326-10" data-blocks='[["BL_326.8",326,[297,1440,1155,343]]]'>This is the principle that is decisive against the present plaintiff. A sale of goods for cash is, strictly speaking, a sale on condition. The contract is <em>do ut des. </em>The condition is more imperative than such as was in this case, but for that reason less easily waived; and yet, if the vendor acquiesce in a possession obtained in disregard of the condition, he waives it; and though he may recover the price by action, he cannot recover the goods in specie.</p>
    <p id="b326-11" data-blocks='[["BL_326.9",326,[298,1783,1151,255]]]'>The condition here was, not that cash should be paid, but that a note should be given, but not insisting on its performance in a reasonable time, and treating the trust as at an end, in respect of these goods, the sale must be held an absolute transfer of the property, and the assignee must look to the purchaser for the price, instead of a return of the goods.</p>

There it is held, that a purchase of goods, with the intention not to pay for them, does not divest the vendor’s title — a rule which has not been permitted to displace ours, and which could not avail the plaintiff, if it had, because there was no evidence that the defendants bought with a formed design not to pay. They did not pay when called on, it is true; but many honest purchasers and debtors are equally negligent, to whom it would be great injustice to impute a design to cheat.</p>
