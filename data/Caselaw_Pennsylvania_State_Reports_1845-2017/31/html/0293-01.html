It is a conveyance of land for the consideration of $1000, to be paid in yearly instalments of $100 each. On one side it is an executed conveyance so as to pass the title, and on the other it remains executory for the payment of the money.</p>

How did the parties intend it, and how ought subsequent purchasers to understand such a form of conveyance ?</p>
    <p id="b294-14" data-blocks='[["BL_294.17",294,[313,1788,1165,430]]]'>It is a conveyance to Ream, his heirs and assigns, for a consideration to be paid, and no one could reasonably suppose that he could buy from Ream clear of this duty of payment. It is therefore a charge on the land, and stands in the title. When the law sells it, it discharges the lien, and pays it off. With this common sense view of the subject, our decisions agree: <a href="/watts/8/0392-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="8 Watts 392" data-case-ids="1848380" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0392-01">8 <em>Watts </em>392</a>; 7 <em>Id. </em>144; 5 <em>State R. </em>418; 20 <em>Id. </em>236, 240; 23 <em>Id. </em>39.
