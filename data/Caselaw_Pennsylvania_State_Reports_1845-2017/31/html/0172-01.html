His deed recites the ■decree of the Circuit Court of the United States and the marshal’s sale, and as none of his constituents or <em>oestuis que trust, </em>or any person claiming under them, question the regularity of his conveyance, it was not for this defendant to question it.

The question raised upon the plaintiff’s title could have been contested with better advantage, after showing his own, if he had any to show, than upon the competency of the evidence. As the case stood, when the deed of Busti and the record of the Circuit Court were offered, the court were bound to presume that the defendant was in without right from those under whom the plaintiffs claimed, and should accordingly have admitted the evidence and put the defendant to the showing of his hand.</p>
