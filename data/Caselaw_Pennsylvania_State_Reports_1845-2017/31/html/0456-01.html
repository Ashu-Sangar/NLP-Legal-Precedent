On the 16th February 1848, by her separate deed (to which her husband, Noah Morrison, was not a party) she conveyed the property to Samuel Bryan, who entered and erected valuable and permanent improvements on the premises; and, on the 4th December 1851, his interest therein was levied on and sold by the sheriff to the defendants.</p>

      <em>“ </em>There is a peculiarity in this case. The plaintiff here made the deed to Bryan, under which defendants claim, and under this title the improvements were made. It is therefore contended, that she cannot say that the improvements were not made <em>bond fide, </em>as the possession was taken and title claimed under her own deed. We are not prepared to say, she is estopped by the deed to deny the <em>bond fide </em>character of Bryan’s possession, or those claiming under him — seeing that the deed has not availed the defendants to secure their possession against the plaintiff. We prefer leaving it to you to determine from the evidence, .whether Bryan, who made the improvements, was a <em>bond fide </em>possessor. One may be a <em>bond fide </em>possessor and claimant of property where his title is defective or even void, as perhaps it was here.</p>

If there had been notice of defect of title, it would he otherwise. But we charge you that the records of the Orphans’ Court by which this lot was allotted to Ann Morrison was not such notice, if you believe her husband had deserted her for fourteen years. It would certainly raise a doubt as to the title, because it contained some evidence she was still under coverture. But it is not sufficient, to raise a mere doubt as to title. One may truly believe he has a good title, although there exist circumstances which create a doubt as to its validity. Here, the deed shows a valuable consideration was paid and expensive improvements made, evincing the perfect faith which Bryan reposed in this title. The doubt, <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>therefore, of the validity, is not inconsistent with the innocent character of the possession.</p>

We were at firsr inclined to think that the improvements could not be offset against any profits except what were occasioned by the enhanced value. But upon reflection, and after hearing the authorities, we think otherwise. They may be set off against all the profits — those which belonged to the property in its original state, and which it produced after the improvements.”</p>

On this sense of justice the action of trespass for mesne profits is founded, and of course it is not intended to be administered so as to work injustice. It is not distinguished in <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>its nature, but only by its special application, from the general action of trespass.</p>
    <p id="b459-6" data-blocks='[["BL_459.4",459,[194,494,1164,687]]]'>Trespasses to personal property are usually very easily measured by the value of the property at the time it was taken or destroyed, or by the degree of impairment of its value. But it is not so with real property withheld from the rightful owner; for it is entirely different in its character. Generally, land is not exclusively adapted to any one special use, like most of articles of personal property, hut may be turned to all imaginable uses, and its condition indefinitely altered at the pleasure of its occupant. Out of these changes of use and condition often arise very complicated questions, in the estimation of damages. In them all, our natural sense of justice is the clue to their solution. They have necessarily given rise to a great variety of decisions, because this sense of justice has had to be applied to a great variety of circumstances. But these decisions, though various, are not therefore contradictory. Generally, they are quite harmonious in their principles.</p>

And if such an occupant changes and improves the property, without objection from the real owner, who knows what is going on, still compensation for the use of the land is all- that is allowed, and the permanent improvements may be full compensation. But one who forcibly disseises another and makes such improvements, or one who makes them after action brought to try the title, can have no claim to have his improvements estimated; because he has no right to choose the mode of improvement of another man’s property, against his known will; and justice will not compensate him at the hazard of doing wrong to the owner.</p>
