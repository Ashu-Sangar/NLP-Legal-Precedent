License is defined to be a power or authority given to a man to do some lawful act, and is a personal liberty to the party to whom given, which cannot be transferred over, but it may be made to a man or his assigns: <em>Tomlin s Law Lio. </em>Because a mere license to enjoy a privilege in land is not an estate therein, it may be granted without deed, and even without writing, notwithstanding the statute of frauds. But here an estate or interest was evidently intended to be conveyed, and it must have been either a corporeal or an incorporeal hereditament.

Lord Mountjoy’s Case, which has often been recognised as good authority, contains all the principles necessary for the decision of this case, if the thing granted be regarded as an incorporeal interest. That case, as reported in <em>Q-odbolt, </em>was thus: — Lord Mount-joy, hy deed, sold and conveyed the manor of Camford, to Brown, in fee, with a proviso in the indenture that contained Brown’s <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>covenant, “that Mountjoy, his heirs and assigns, may dig for ore within the land in Oamford, which is a great waste, and also to dig for turf there, to make alum and copperas, without any contradiction of the said Brown, his heirs and assigns.”</p>

Caldwell reserved no interest himself. He sold for a valuable consideration, all he had in the sixteen acres, and all the coal in his other land. I say all, because the grant is limited to no time, or quantity, or purpose] or- person. The full right to take stone coal to any extent the grantee, his heirs or assigns, may think proper to do, or cause to be done, are not, perhaps, the best chosen words for describing the <em>corpus ; </em>but what less than the whole of the coal can they be construed to mean ? If not the whole, how much coal is granted ? Can a reservation to the grantor be implied, in the face of terms so large ? That were to reverse the maxim that deeds are to be taken most strongly against the grantor. The will of the grantee was the measure of the grant. Not only he, his heirs and assigns, were to take <em>ad </em>libitum, but might <em>cause to be </em>taken, without stint. The grantee might plant a miner on every available foot of the coal, under that deed. There was one only condition, that the entrance to the coal, and the discharge therefrom, should be on the sixteen acres, and because this was expressed, no other was intended. <em>JExpressio unius exclusio alterius. </em>Subject to that condition alone, the grantee was invested with complete dominion over the coal. What room was left for the grantor ? Might he too mine coal ? Assuredly not, against the consent of his alienee, for he had sold all the coal that alienee might think proper to take, or cause to be taken. <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>And if the grantor might not mine of right, then the grant was total; he might not take a part, because he had conveyed the whole. There are many untechnical words, which, receiving an interpretation according to substance, are held to vest effectual estates. Thus a grant of the profits, or income, or rent and issues, or acceptation and profit, or free use, or the right to dispose of, or to give or sell, or to dispose of at will or pleasure, or to do his will therewith, or to be at his discretion, or to be freely enjoyed, are sufficient to pass the title out of which such rights are to flow, or over which such powers are given, where no evidence of a contrary intention is furnished by the instrument itself: 1 <em>Salk. </em>228; 5 <em>Mod. </em>63, 98, 101; <em>Oro. Miz. </em>190; <em>Oro. Jac. </em>104; <em>Plowd. </em>541; <em>Viner Abr. </em>(Devise II.); 9 <em>Mass. B,. </em>372. It was in relation to such grants that Gibson, C. J., said in Morris <em>v. </em>Phalen, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20390" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Watts 390">1 <em>Watts </em>390</a>, “ it is an undoubted rule, that the bequest of a general power of disposal carries the absolute property, whenever a limited interest is not given. For such a "power, being a principal attribute of ownership, necessarily implies the existence of it, whenever the implication is not rebutted by the bequest of a special interest inconsistent with it.” These are principles in the construction of wills, but equally applicable to deeds, except in those instances where inflexible rules of law demand certain words of perpetuity, to create more than estates for life. For these reasons, drawn both from an analysis of the deed itself, and from the principles of interpretation, as applied to written instruments, we conclude that Caldwell sold and conveyed to Greer the absolute and exclusive right to all the coal under his land; and from this it must necessarily follow, it was a corporeal, and not an incorporeal interest. An exclusive right to all the coal, to be taken, without limitation, except as to the point of ingress and egress, is a sale of the coal itself; and there is nothing incorporeal about coal. It is included in the definition of land, and those hereditaments only are incorporeal which are not land. Rent is the best definition of an incorporeal hereditament; it issues out of the thing corporate, but is no part of it. The thing is as perfect after render of the rent, as before. So common of pasture is a right issuing from land, without diminution of the source; common of estovers, of turbary, and of coals, are not, strictly speaking, incorporeal, for they are not so much the produce of lands annually renewable, as they are part of the land itself. But these are always appendant or appurtenant to a particular tenement, and, as a classification, cannot comprehend coal mines which are worked for purposes of trade and profit. And to none of these distinctions in the law of common can this grant be referred, if we are right in holding it to be exclusive in the grantee and his assigns. It is their close, as much as if it were land. This point was ruled in Wilson <em>v. </em>Mackreth, 3 <em>Burr. </em>1825. The action <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>there was trespass for entering plaintiff’s close, and digging and carrying away turf and peat. The objection was, that the remedy should have been case, as the plaintiff did not own the soil. But all the judges held the action would lie, because the plaintiff had an exclusive right to the turf and peat.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b480-6" data-blocks='[["BL_480.4",480,[274,655,1158,426]]]'>Can it be doubted that these defendants might maintain trespass and ejectment against intruders into their mines? It has been often ruled in England, that trespass and ejectment will lie in respect to open coal mines, for of these there can he possession; but mines not opened, when held by another than the owner of the soil, are sometimes said to be incorporeal, because they lie in grant, and are not susceptible of livery of seisin. With us, delivery and registration of the deed stand in lieu of livery, and there is no ground or reason for maintaining an embarrassing distinction in respect to this very important, kind of property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b480-7" data-blocks='[["BL_480.5",480,[267,1077,1160,1241]]]'>It is a common thing, in the mineral districts of Pennsylvania, for the surface to belong to one owner, and the coal which it covers to another. Both the surface and the coal are held by deeds, executed and delivered, and recorded in the same manner; and there is no more reason for considering the coal an incorporeal hereditament, because it has not been opened, than there is for considering the soil such, because it has not been ploughed. Still less reason is there for calling it an incorporeal hereditament, if the deed happen to describe the grant as a right to enter, dig, and carry away all the coal, instead of describing the coal without the customary circumlocution. In all these cases, where the right, rather than the thing, is described, nobody is at a loss to know ■what is intended to pass. It is the thing that is bought and sold. And where that is a coal bed, it is an abuse of language, and an unnecessary application of legal distinctions, to call it an incorporeal hereditament. Some late English cases indicate an inclination in their courts to treat these mine rights, as we think they should be treated, as corporeal hereditaments. In the case of Humphries <em>v. </em>Brogden, 1 <em>Law ¿-Equity R. </em>241, the action was on the case, by the surface owner against the mine owner in an adjoining lot, for removing the subjacent mineral strata, w'hereby the natural support of the plaintiff’s lot was taken away, and it subsided, greatly to his injury; and in Jeffries <em>v. </em>Williams, <em><a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20390" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Watts 390">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20390" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Watts 390">433</a>, the facts were similar. Throughout both cases, the mine right, severed from the ownership of the soil, was regarded as a separate close, and compared to the lower story of a building, which the owner is bound to keep in a suitable condition to support the upper stories, owned by others, as the owner of the upper story is bound to maintain the.roof, for the protection of all below him.</p>

The writ of error is designed to bring under review the adjudication which was then made. At that time, this court was of opinion that the deed from Caldwell to Greer was an absolute and exclusive conveyance of all the coal under the grantor’s land, and not a mere license, or incor-poreal hereditament. Such a construction of the deed is supposed to have been erroneous, and we have heard an earnest and able argument in support of the opposite interpretation.</p>

It is to be observed in the description of the thing granted, that there are no limits fixed upon the extent to which coal might be taken from the land then owned and occupied by the grantor. The grantee’s right was coextensive with his will; not necessarily to be exercised by himself, but one -which might be enjoyed by others whom he should authorize. No form of words other than those employed could have given him larger dominion.</p>

It is no longer to be doubted that they are subject to conveyance as such. Nothing is more common in Pennsylvania than that the surface right should be in one man, and the mineral right in another. It is not denied, in such a ease, that both are landowners, both holders of a corporeal hereditament. Our English ancestors, indeed, found difficulty in conceiving of a corporeal interest in an unopened mine— separate from the ownership of the surface — because livery of seisin was in their minds inseparable from a conveyance of land, and livery could not be made of an unopened mine. The consequence was, that they were disposed to regard such rights as incorporeal, though they are not rights issuing out of land, but the substance itself. In this state, however, livery of seisin is supplied by the deed and its registration, and there is nothing incongruous in considering a grant of the <em>substratum </em>a grant of land, as much as is a conveyance of the surface itself. It is often by far the most valuable, and sometimes embraces all for which the land is worth owning. Even in England, so long ago as the reign of James I., it was held that ejectment would lie for a coal mine: Comyn <em>v. </em>Wheatly, <em>Cro. Jac. </em>150. It was objected that it was beneath the soil, and that an <em>habere facias </em>could not be thereof; but the objection was disallowed. Yet, ejectment cannot be sustained for an incorporeal hereditament, except perhaps in the case of a common appendant or appurtenant. With us, unfettered as we are by the necessity of livery of seisin, and abounding in mineral districts, I am not aware that it has been seriously doubted that the ownership of a coal bed or seam is a corporeal interest in land. Cases not unfrequently occur, in which the owner of lands sells merely the surface right, retaining <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>the minerals which lie in place below the surface. Now, as his whole interest was corporeal before the sale, and as by his deed only the surface passed, that which remains ungranted must be corporeal. This proposition needs no further argument, and it has not been questioned in the discussion before us. In Turner <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 11 <em>Harris </em>199, a plaintiff in ejectment was allowed to recover a coal mine which he had described in his writ as land, and this, though his title was under a conveyance to him, not of the tract of land, but of the coal..</p>
    <p id="b484-6" data-blocks='[["BL_484.4",484,[412,825,1162,1061]]]'>If then the ownership of the coal or other minerals in a tract of land may be vested in one person, while the right to the surface belongs to another, the next inquiry is, by what words it may be granted. There are two modes in which the subject-matter of a deed may be described, both equally potential. The one is by a description of the thing itself, as of land by metes and bounds, or by a known name, and the other is by a designation of its usufruct, or of the dominion over it. Thus a grant of the rents, issues, and profits of a tract of land is uniformly held to be a grant of the land itself: <em>Co. Litt. </em>4 b. Judgments abound to this effect in regard to devises, and though in wills and deeds the rules of construction differ relative to words limiting the estate granted, yet they are the same of words describing the subject-matter of the grant. There are also cases of the same character to be found in regard to deeds. Thus it has been held that by the grant of a boilery of salt the land passes, for that is the whole profit, <em>Co. Litt. </em>4b; or a mine of lead, <em><a href="/wend/10/0639-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="10 Wend. 639" data-case-ids="2012901" data-case-paths="/wend/10/0639-01">Id.</a> 6 </em>a.

The reason is that the grant of a thing can be no more than the grant of the full and unlimited use of it. So too the general power of disposal without liability to account is equivalent to ownership itself, it being the highest attribute of ownership, and a gift of the one necessarily carries with it the other. This is the doctrine of Morris <em>v. </em>Phalen, <a href="/watts/1/0389-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="1 Watts 389" data-case-ids="1838049" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0389-01">1 <em>Watts </em>389</a>.</p>

Because, says the plaintiff in error, it is not a grant of the thing itself, but of a right <em>to take it, </em>and until it is seized or taken the property in the thing remains in the grantor. But if the conveyance of the whole use of a thing, and of the absolute dominion over it, is a grant of the thing itself, only differing in the mode of describing the subject, it is not easy to see what more Caldwell could have sold than he did. If in another form of wrords he had described the coal as the subject of the grant, Greer would have possessed no greater beneficial rights than were given to him by the form adopted. The ownership of the coal in the ground is but a “ full <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>right, title, and privilege” to dig and carry it away, nothing more, nothing less. The words employed in the deed-express absolute dominion, and complete enjoyment. These constitute property, and all that is understood in proprietorship.</p>
    <p id="b485-6" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[122,620,1162,300]]]'>Again, says the plaintiff in error, this is but a grant of a right to take and carry away part of the profits, and that while a grant of a right to take all the rents, issues, and profits of a tract of land is equivalent to a conveyance of the land itself, because it embraces their whole usufruct, a grant of a right to take part, such as “ iron ore, coals,” or “ minerals,” is not. It is said that in such a case the grantee can only take in common with the grantor.</p>
    <p id="b485-7" data-blocks='[["BL_485.5",485,[121,919,1164,845]]]'>The argument is based upon a misconception. The subject alleged to have been granted here is not the tract of land, but the coal in it, which, as we have seen, is capable of a separate conveyance, and which may be vested in one person, while the ownership of the tract of land, as such, may be another’s. The alleged subject of the grant then being the coal in the land, the substratum, the argument is inapplicable. The whole usufruct of that, as well as the entire dominion over it, was granted. The deed is not a conveyance of part of the usufruct, por of the usufruct of part of the coal, but of the entire enjoyment. As already said, there was no limit to the grantee’s right but his own will. He could take out coal to any extent. He could cause it to be taken out to any extent, and at all times under any of the land. He was accountable to no one. His entrance to it and his exit from it were indeed required to be on his own land; but the right to take the coal itself was absolutely unlimited. It would seem, therefore, that, according to well-established rules of construction, the deed of Caldwell to Greer was a conveyance of the coal itself, and not of a mere easement, or incorporeal hereditament.</p>

Litt. </em>104 b, and by <em>Moore </em>174. It is, however, more fully reported in some respects, by Anderson, C. J., who was one of the justices who decided it. In his reports, page 307, we have the words of the reservation given at length. They are, “ Provided always, and it is covenanted, granted, concluded, and agreed between the said parties to this indenture; and the said John Brown and Charles, and their heirs, covenant and grant to and with the said Lord Mountjoy, his heirs and assigns, by these presents, in form following, that is to say. That it shall be lawful for the said Lord Mountjoy, his heirs and assigns, at all times hereafter to have, take, and dig, in and upon the heath ground of the premises, from time to time, sufficient ores, <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>heath, turves, and other necessaries for the malting of alum and copperas.” This was very properly held to have been a grant of an incorporeal hereditament. Unlike the case we have under consideration, it was not a grant of unlimited dominion over the ores and turf. It was not a grant of a right to dig, take, and carry away without stint, but only sufficient for a single specified purpose, viz.: the manufacture of alum and copperas. It was very aptly likened to a grant of common <em>sans nombre, </em>but was not an exclusive right. SurelyUffiereMs-Very little resemblance between that case and the present. It is not at all in conflict with the construction we place upon Caldwell’s deed to Greer.</p>
    <p id="b486-6" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[360,903,1161,1454]]]'>Then follows the case of Chetham <em>v. </em>Williamson, 4 <em>East </em>469, where the subject was not described in the granting part of the deed, nor in connection with the other property conveyed. The grantee after the <em>habendum </em>covenanted that it should be lawful for Hyde, one of the grantors, and his heirs, <em>“ </em>at all times to enter into all or any part of the premises to search for and dig for coal or stone, or any other mine or mineral whatsoever, and the same to take, have, and carry away to his own use; provided and upon condition that it should and might be lawful for the grantee, his heirs, &amp;c., to deduct from the rent reserved by the grantor out of the land, all or so much as should be reasonable, for any hurt, damage, or prejudice, that should be done to the premises, by reason of digging for, or carrying away any of the mine or mines aforesaid.” The question was whether the alienee of Hyde, one of the grantors, and who had conveyed only an equity of redemption, could maintain trover against the covenantor for coals taken out of the land by him. It was held that he could not. Lawrence, J., placed the judgment upon the ground that the covenant could not operate as an exception or reservation in favour of Hyde, who had no legal estate in him at the time, but only the equity of redemption. He said that Hyde “ being a stranger to the estate, he could not except or reserve that which he had not before. The covenant therefore could only operate as a grant, but a grant will not pass the land itself without livery.” Lord Ellenborough confined his attention to the question whether the grant was exclusive. The differences between the case and the present one are sufficiently obvious. It is one very material distinction, that in Chetham <em>v. </em>Williamson, the right to take coal or minerals was not a thing for which the consideration mentioned in the deed was given. They were to be paid for when taken. In a deed of bargain and sale, it is the payment of the consideration which transfers the use, and with it the legal title. The case is also illustrative of the fetters which the doctrine of livery of seisin has imposed upon the construction of deeds.</p>

The court held it to be a license on the ground, among others, that it was a right to dig, search for, &amp;c., “ <em>the minerals that should within that term there he found" </em>and not a grant of the entire subject. The indenture also contained covenants of the grantee to render a share of the ore he might find, and to allow the grantor himself to drive_adüa,„ The case is no authority in support of the argument of the plaintiff in error.</p>
    <p id="b487-6" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[178,861,1171,1114]]]'>The only other case to which we are referred is Grubb <em>v. </em>Bayard, 2 <em>Wallace, Jr. </em>81. There the grant was to dig, take, and carry away all iron ore to be found within the bounds of a tract of land of the grantor, provided the grantee should pay unto the grantor, his heirs and assigns, the sum of sixpence for every ton taken from the premises. This was held to be an incorporeal hereditament, it will be observed, that there was no present consideration passed, nor was there a covenant of the grantee to search for or take any ore. He might never have taken any. In that event, if the deed had been held a conveyance of the iron ore, there Avould have been a sale without a consideration. Nor was it a grant of the whole, but, said Mr. Justice Grier, of the iron ore that should be found within the term, and on that account was but a license. He also remarked that “ if it had been a grant of an absolute property in all the iron ore in the tract, the deed would have been insufficient to convey title without livery of seisin.” This' observation goes beyond the English cases, and is.not necessary to the judgment rendered. In Grubb <em>v. </em>Bayard, Judge Kane delivered a concurring opinion. In it, he refers to the absence of a covenant by the grantee to work the mines, and thus make the rent reserved of value, as a circumstance of much importance in determining the intentions of the parties. That it is so, is obvious, for without it the contract might have proved entirely fruitless to the vendor, while in the present case, Caldwell has received all that he ever can receive. The right, whatever it is, is one for which all the consideration has -been paid.</p>
    <p id="b487-7" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[176,1977,1165,515]],["BL_488.1",488,[330,482,1166,945]]]'>These are all the cases adduced to sustain the doctrine that a conveyance of a right to dig/ take, and carry away the coal or minerals in a tract of land, though the grant be unlimited in quantity, time, or purpose for which the minerals may be taken, conveys no interest in the coal or minerals until they are taken, passes only an incorporeal hereditament. None of them were decided upon the ground of any supposed distinction between a right to take all the coal and carry it away, and a right to the coal itself. They are all cases in which there was no unrestricted power of taking and disposition conferred upon the grantee. The coal or minerals was to be taken either for a limited purpose, or in restricted quantities, and generally was not to be paid for until <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>taken. And in most of them it is easy to see that the supposed necessity of livery of seisin, in order to pass a corporeal interest in land, was a controlling consideration in the minds of the judges. Even in Grubb <em>v. </em>Bayard, it seems not to have been without influence. The impossibility of making livery is, however, m Pennsylvania, no reason for refusing to give a construction to a deed accordant with the intention of the parties. When the intent is to give the entire usufruct and power of disposal, the legal title must he held to pass. Even in- England, livery of seisin is no longer indispensable to the grant of a corporeal hereditament. Unopened mines may be conveyed, and the grantee takes more than a right issuing out of land, or exercisable therein. He takes the mines themselves. In Stoughton <em>v. </em>Leigh, 4 <em>Taunt. </em>402, a widow was held entitled to dower of mines, not only in lands in which her husband had been seised in his lifetime and during coverture, but also in those which were in the lands of other persons, the minerals or <em>substratum </em>of which had ■ been conveyed to him. It was also ruled, that in assigning her dower, the sheriff should set off to her not one-third.of the profits, but one-third of the mines themselves, and that the partition might he made either by metes and bounds, or by directing separate alternate periods of enjoyment.</p>
    <p id="b488-6" data-blocks='[["BL_488.4",488,[322,1424,1165,640]]]'>It is not strange, therefore, that it had been held in this state before the controversy between these parties was first here, that an unrestricted right to take and carry away all the coal in a tract of land is a corporeal right and exclusive. In Benson <em>v. </em>The Miners’ Bank, 8 <em>Harris </em>370, we have this case: Reese was seised of two undivided third parts of a tract of land, and of one-fifth of all the fossil coal under it. He made a deed for the tract to Kepner, containing the clause “ excepting and for ever reserving the liberties and privileges for the heirs and legal representatives of Samuel Potts, deceased, (of whom he was one), to dig, take, and carry away all the stone coal that is or may hereafter be found on the above described tract of land.” The judgment of this court was, that the deed conveyed no part of the stone coal to the -grantee of the land. Of course it remained reserved or ungranted as a corporeal hereditament.</p>

Such was the opinion of this court in 1855, when the same deed was here for construction, and the very able argument of the counsel for the plaintiff in error, has failed to convince us that the court was then mistaken.</p>

The original articles of agreement were offered for the same purpose. This evidence was not submitted to show fraud or mistake in the deed, nor had it any tendency to show either. Its purpose was to control the meaning of the words which the parties used. It is, however, the settled rule, that a deed must be construed, “ <em>ex viseeribus suis.” </em>When the intent is clearly expressed, no evidence of extraneous facts or circumstances can be received to alter it: Means <em>v. </em>Presbyterian Church, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0303-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 303" data-case-ids="1854624" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0303-01">3 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>303</a>; Brown <em>v. </em>Nickle, 6 <em>Barr </em>390; Lyon <em>v. </em>Miller, 12 <em>Harris </em>392. It may be admitted, that when the deed leaves the subject-matter of the grant in doubt, parol evidence may be resorted to, in order to ascertain it, but the nature and quantity of the interest conveyed is always to be ascertained from the instrument itself. Here the inquiry is, what dominion or ownership, if any, in the coal, Caldwell granted, and that must be determined exclusively from the words which he employed. The evidence was therefore rightly rejected.</p>
