In going to the shop for shavings, it was necessary for the boys to cross the Allegheny Portage railroad, which lies, immediately in front of Juniata street, in the borough of Hollidaysburg. The plaintiff was on his way back from the carpenter shop, when, at the public crossing on the Allegheny Portage Railroad, he found the passage blocked up by a long train of railroad cars, so as to prevent him from crossing. The cars of the defendant were standing immediately on the crossing, without any conductor or other person in charge; the conductor having left the train standing on the crossing, for the purpose of eating his breakfast.</p>

It is alleged that the cars of the defendants were unlawfully obstructing the public crossing, or highway; and that that was negligence. Assuming it to be true that they were, that would render them <em>primá facie </em>responsible for any injury to others resulting directly from that obstruction; and for that only. If, for example, any one should be detained in the pursuit of his busi<a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>ness, by the obstruction, so as to sustain any appreciable loss or injury, he would have his right of action. But, evidently, if there had been nothing more than the obstruction of the crossing, this injury could not have occurred. If the cars had been allowed to stand there from that day to this, all the children in the vicinity might have crept under daily and every day, and no one would have been run over,, and injured, as the plaintiff was. It may be said, on the other hand, if the obstruction had not been there, the accident would not have happened. But it still might have happened, without any <em>unlawful </em>obstruction. And it may be answered further, if the railroad had not been made by the Commonwealth, it could not have happened. In the case of Kelly <em>v. </em>The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, recently tried in Huntingdon, the boy injured had been sent by his father across the railroad, <em>for tobacco. </em>If the father in that case had not been addicted to the vice of using tobacco, the accident would not have happened! The truth is, when we suffer ourselves to go out after <em>remote </em>causes, we are far at sea, without helm or any guide. The <em>proximate </em>cause of this injury, it is quite clear, was the <em>moving </em>of the ears. They were put in motion at the time <em>by Archibald McFadden’s driver; </em>and whether, if there was negligence in that, the defendants are responsible for it, depends upon the question whether or not he was the servant of the defendants. And, in view of the facts in this part of the case, if we have understood and stated them truly —and the jury will judge of that — on the authority of adjudged cases, bearing to this an analogy so close as to be undistinguishable in principle, we are of opinion he was not; and that he and his employer only, if any one, were responsible for the consequences^ of his negligence, if negligence was imputable: Laugher <em>v. </em>Pointer, 11 <em>Eng. O. L. </em>579, and Quarman <em>v. </em>Burnett, 6 <em>Meeson fr Welsby </em>499.</p>

It is also a material question of fact, whether, though the cars were upon the crossing, that was an <em>unlawful </em>obstruction by the defendants or their servants. The testimony of Hays, the conductor of the defendants’ cars, is, that they were stopped there, in their downward course, by ‘bumping’ against coal cars of Mr. Miller, standing on the track below. It was the road of the Commonwealth — Mr. Miller, and every -one else who chose, had the same right to have cars upon it that the defendants had; and if Hays might not and should not have stopped the cars above the crossing, or might not or should not have afterwards moved them back, so as to leave it open, of which you will judge, the obstruction could not be considered an <em>unlawful </em>obstruction, at least by the defendants. Whether it was or was not, would depend upon the question, whether it might reasonably have been avoided; and of this you will judge, if you find it necessary, in making up your verdict,</p>

But, assuming the defendants to have unlawfully obstructed this crossing, and that such obstruction was the proximate cause of the injury, the question recurs, was there concurring negligence on the part of the plaintiff? or, in other words, might it or might it not have been avoided, by the exercise of ordinary care on the part of the plaintiff?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b361-6" data-blocks='[["BL_361.4",361,[174,666,1167,905]]]'>“ Upon this question,.if the plaintiff had been an adult of ordinary prudence and discretion, he would clearly have no right of action. However deeply the defendants might have been in fault, their fault would not be equal to his folly. But it is contended, that the negligence, or want of ordinary care, which, concurring with the negligence or fault which is the proximate cause of the injury, would destroy the right of action, is to be judged of and determined by the jury from all the circumstances, and in view of the age and capacity of the party injured. Our view of what the rule here should be, is, that until a child has sufficient age and discretion to keep clear of danger so imminent and palpable, it should be kept under the eye and control of its parents or guardians. But admitting the law to be as contended by the plaintiff’s counsel, and the weight of authority seems to sustain them, and we so instruct you, the question, as one of fact, assumes this shape: Has or has not a boy who is capable of performing an errand, sufficient intelligence and discretion to know the hazard of creeping under a train of cars liable to be started any moment? And had or had not the plaintiff such intelligence and discretion? And this you, gentlemen, will determine from the evidence, if in coming to a conclusion the case should turn upon this question.</p>

If, on the other hand, the injury was not caused hy the negligence of the defendants or their servants, but by the servant of Archibald McFadden; or if the crossing was not unlawfully obstructed by them or their servants; or, however either or both of these questions may be viewed or determined, if in view of all the circumstances of this case, disclosed in the evidence, the plaintiff himself was chargeable with negligence or fault, your verdict should be for the defendants.</p>

On the morning of the 9th of July 1855, when he was about six or seven years of age, he was sent by his father, who resides on Juniata street, in Hollidaysburg, to a carpenter’s shop in the neighbourhood, for a basket of shavings. He was accompanied by another small boy. It was necessary for the boys to cross the Allegheny Portage Railroad, which they did by the public crossing. On their return, they found this passage blocked up by a train of railroad cars. There were twelve or thirteen cars in the train, the hindmost, or the next to the hindmost car being on the crossing, and immediately behind this train there was a train of empty coal cars. The boys attempted to' pass under the car that stood on the crossing, and whilst in the act of doing so, Green, who was McFadden’s driver, having hitched horses to the foremost car, started the train, and the wheels of one or more of the cars passed over both of the feet of the plaintiff, crushing them in such manner that to save his life both legs had to be amputated.</p>
