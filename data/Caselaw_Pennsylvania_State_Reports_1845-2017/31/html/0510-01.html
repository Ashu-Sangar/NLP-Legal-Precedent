It is already in evidence that plaintiff’s boats were moored and tied with the knowledge of defendant. This was an implied permission, and unless the defendant offers to show that he refused permission, he cannot excuse himself for the consequences of his negligence by showing that permission was not asked and granted.”</p>

If the defendant failed to use ordinary care, skill, and diligence to prevent the barges from being swept off by the current ; and if they were swept off by reason of defendant’s negligence in not securely fastening them in the first instance with proper cables, or in suffering the cables to he so worn by use, as to become defective and insufficient; and if, without any default on the part of the plaintiff, his boat was sunk in consequence of its being struck by defendant’s barges, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover in this action, for the injury thus occasioned by defendant’s negligence.

And not only for the reason assigned by the court, but because it was not relevant. One trespass, even if it amounted to this, would not justify another; and the testimony, if it had been admitted, could have had no operation, unless this rule were reversed. Indeed, the reasoning for the position contended for, necessarily maintained the principle that, the defendant, on account of the alleged trespass of the plaintiff in fastening his boat to a rock at his landing, might have cast it adrift or otherwise destroyed it without liability. A doctrine that no law will justify. The offered testimony did not touch the point of insufficient fastening, and for all these reasons was inadmissible.</p>
