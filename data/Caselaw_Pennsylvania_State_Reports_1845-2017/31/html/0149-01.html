In such a case, I think it is clear, that there is no curtesy in the husband. All the cases, however, in which a trust for separate use has been maintained against the statute of uses, and even the more extended principle indicated by Lowrie, J., in Kuhn <em>v. </em>Newman, 2 <em>Qasey </em>230, will be found, on examination, to be where there was coverture, either existing or contemplated, of the <em>cestui que use, </em>when the provision was made or took effect.
