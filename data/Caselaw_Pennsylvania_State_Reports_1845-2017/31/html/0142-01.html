If, then, he was a purchaser for a valuable consideration actually paid, neither he, nor any one subsequently claiming under him, can be affected by any claim to the mortgage preferred by the heirs of Joseph Budd.</p>
    <p id="b148-5" data-blocks='[["BL_148.4",148,[320,667,1168,1707]]]'>The assignment to him acknowledges the payment of the pecuniary consideration. It is argued, however, that it is not evidence for such a purpose, and that direct proof of payment must be made by another medium than the receipt in the'deed. The doctrine that to establish a <em>bond fide </em>purchase for a valuable consideration without notice, against a prior fraud or a secret trust, the receipt in a deed is no evidence of payment, has been carried very far'in this state. We are not disposed to extend it. Indeed, until the existence of a latent trust or anterior fraud has first been shown, the receipt is sufficient to establish a transfer of the use to the vendee, and is evidence for all purposes against the grantor who signed it. If it be said that, as against a stranger who claims in opposition to the deed, the receipt is a mere <em>ex parte </em>declaration not under oath, and not guarded by cross-examination, the same may be said of the deed itself. The receipt, as much as the words of grant and those of description, or the <em>habendum </em>and <em>tenendum, </em>is a part of the <em>res gestee, </em>a part of the transaction of purchase; and if the latter are evidence, it is difficult to see why the former should have no importance attached to it. Purchase for a valuable consideration paid, is an equitable defence; and, in equity, is sufficiently maintained by a defendant’s answer under oath, unless that oath is overbalanced by positive evidence upon the other side. But when this plea is introduced into a suit at law, as it often is in this state, he who asserts it is deprived of the protection which his oath would give him in equity, where the plea properly belongs. Yet, it is undoubtedly true, that, where a party claims under a deed from a fraudulent grantor, or from a trustee in whom there is a secret trust, he must not only have been without notice of the fraud or trust, but must have paid an adequate valuable consideration ; and he cannot rely upon the receipt in his deed alone, for proof of the payment of the purchase-money. But is this doctrine without any limitation <em>? </em>Does this necessity to adduce evidence beyond his deed continue for ever ? When forty years of enjoyment under his deed have passed away, must he still produce in court living witnesses to prove an actual payment of the consideration which the grantor, against his own interest, acknowledged he had received ? If so, then his condition is worse than if he held by <em>mere livery of seisin, </em>without a parchment. Then, secret trusts and frauds are immortal, and honest rights die with the first generation. Such is not the law.</p>

A deed proves itself after thirty years, if possession has accompanied it. A resulting trust is presumed to have been extinguished after twenty-one years, if nothing has been done to keep it alive. After twenty-one years’ enjoyment of a way, a grant is presumed; and after a lapse of twenty years, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the law presumes that a bond, a recognisance, and even a judgment has been paid. Surely after twenty years, it may with equal propriety be held, in Aid of the receipt of a grantor, that the purchase-money has been paid.</p>
