Danner died intestate, possessed of certain real estate which he derived by will from his father, Adam Danner, deceased. The intestate died without leaving mother, brothers, or sisters, or lineal descendants, but leaving as his next of kin an uncle and two aunts, and the children of a deceased aunt, and also Lydia Shissler (for whose use this suit is brought), an aunt, being a sister of the half blood of his father. It is contended, on behalf of the defendants, that under these circumstances, she not being of the whole blood of the <em>perquisitor, </em>therefore she cannot participate in the money arising from the real estate of the intestate; this action being founded on the recognisance which was entered into by Michael Danner and his sureties, when he accepted of the property at the appraisement, in the Orphans’ Court of this county. It is true, that the Act of the 8th of April 1833, P. <em>L. </em>316, provides, that when an intestate dies, leaving brothers and sisters, or nephews and nieces, children of a deceased brother or sister of the whole blood, they shall be preferred to the half blood; but the case now before us is not embraced, in our opinion, by this provision, but falls under the provision of the law, which prescribes that, in default of persons mentioned by the said act, the real and personal estate of the intestate shall descend to and amongst the next of kin to such intestate, and that no person who is not of the <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>blood of tbe ancestor or other relative or person from whom such real estate descended, or by whom it was given or devised to the intestate, shall take any estate of inheritance therein, but such real estate shall pass to and vest in such other person, as would be entitled by said act, if the person not of the blood of such ancestor or other relation had never existed, or was dead at the decease of the intestate. Here, the person for whose use this suit is brought, answers the description required by law, she is of the next of kin of the deceased, and also of the blood of the person from whom the estate descended. The law does not require her to be of the whole blood, if she has any portion of his blood, it is sufficient: Baker <em>v. </em>Chalfant, <a href="/whart/5/0477-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Whart. 477" data-case-ids="8878686" data-case-paths="/whart/5/0477-01">5 <em>Wh. </em>477</a>; Hart’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Barb.%2032" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Barb. 32">8 <em>B. </em>32</a>.
