A <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued to collect the amount, returnable to March Term, 1855; and the defendants <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>moved to set the same aside, because they had not signified their intention to take possession of the ground, and because they had not finally adopted the route through the plaintiff’s land, but had instituted the proceeding in order to obtain a means of estimating the expense of this route in comparison with others. The rule was made absolute, and of this the plaintiff complains.</p>

The law allows this proceeding after the road is located, and after a proper effort to agree upon compensation has failed; and the damages found and confirmed under it, settles the right of the landowner to such damages as completely as any other form of judgment, and he has the same right to execution. He is not to wait until the company say they are ready to go on, else all improvements by the owners of land along such a route must be indefinitely suspended upon a contingent appropriation. If judgments are to be the end of strife, they must bind both parties. The company has made its choice, and must stand to it. If they have any equitable ground for relief, they must present it in some other form than a mere motion to set aside a regular execution.</p>
