The natural love and affection which constituted the consideration of the deed, and the maintenance and education which were among the objects it aimed to promote, had reference, and in the nature of things must have had exclusive reference, to the children then in being; they were before the grandfather’s eyes, and were most manifestly the objects of his bounty.</p>

His words were, “ All the farm which was conveyed to me by Cornelius Cole, situate on the river Delaware, in the township aforesaid,” &amp;c. The citations from Preston and the Touchstone prove that a fee may be created, where such is the intention, by reference to another instrument; but they do not prove, what is contended for here, that a deed, plainly creating a life estate, can be construed a conveyance of the fee, because, to fix the outlines of the property, a deed is referred to which did pass a fee simple estate in the land. This argument is not worthy of more consideration.</p>
    <p id="b171-7" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[155,1181,1164,386]]]'>It is next urged, that as William was in possession, the conveyance may operate by way of release, -and vest a fee without the word heirs. As the tenant of his father, William was capable of receiving a release, by way of enlarging the estate already in him; but releases which operate by enlargement of estate, require the same technical words of limitation as feoffments or grants: 4 <em>Cruise on Real Property </em>81. The very example which this author puts is this, if a lessor releases to his lessee for years all his right in the land, this will only pass an estate for life.</p>
    <p id="b171-8" data-blocks='[["BL_171.6",171,[153,1568,1165,302]]]'>There are certain kinds of release, those which enure by way of <em>mitter le estate </em>and <em>mitter le droit, </em>by which a fee will pass without words of limitation; but the first of these obtains only between joint tenants or coparceners, and the last between disseisor, his heir or feoffee, and the disseisee. Judge Brink and his son stood in none of these relations, and it was a mistake to suppose that their transaction was subject to these principles of law.</p>
    <p id="b171-9" data-blocks='[["BL_171.7",171,[151,1870,1165,384]]]'>The final suggestion is, that this deed may be construed as a covenant to stand seised to uses. Possibly it may, and if we were defining the estate of the children, it might be convenient to so consider it. But we are now on the question whether William took a fee simple, and it is not perceived that this suggestion has any relevancy to that question. As between the father and the son, the transaction was a simple conveyance of a life estate, and we cannot, on any of the grounds suggested, give it any other or greater effect.</p>
    <p id="b171-10" data-blocks='[["BL_171.8",171,[148,2255,1166,174]]]'>The argument, then, that William took a fee, failing at all points, the case stands on the construction we have given to the word children, and it follows that the judgment below was properly rendered for the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b171-11" data-blocks='[["BL_171.9",171,[818,2429,448,42]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
