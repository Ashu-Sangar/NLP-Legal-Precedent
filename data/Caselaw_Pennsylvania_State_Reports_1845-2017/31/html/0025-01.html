Consequently, if the jury believe that Dr. Mitcheltree wished to burn or destroy this will, and was prevented from doing so only by the artifice or fraud of Mrs. Jane Mitcheltree, then the revocation was complete under the Act of 1833.</p>

      <em>“ </em>2d. As to this point we have some doubt, but the jury will take our answer as binding upon them. Had Dr. Mitcheltree expressly directed his wife to destroy or burn the will, and in his presence she had burned a paper, which she represented was the will (it being in her possession), and the husband afterwards labored under the delusion, we doubt whether it would not have been such a virtual compliance with the statute as would have operated to revoke the will. In the case of Doe d. Reed <em>v. </em>Harris, 6 <em>Adolphus JEJllis </em>209, it was, however, said by Denman, C. J., ‘ That a great inconvenience would be introduced by holding that there may be a virtual compliance with the statute, but there is none in saying that if the testator perseveres in the intention of revoking his will, he should fulfil it by some of the means pointed out in the statute; that he shall revoke his will, if not in his possession, by writing, properly attested.’ But in the present case we are of opinion that the evidence does not show an <em>express </em>direction to Mrs. Mitcheltree to destroy the will. From a subsequent ratification of her act a previous direction might be implied. But our stature uses the word ‘ <em>express’ </em>This word is not in the British statute. It must be considered to have been inserted for some purpose, as our statute seems to be a transcript from the 29th Charles II., carefully altered to meet the intention of our legislature.</p>

The words Dr. Mitcheltree used when the paper was thrown into the fire, according to the deposition of Mitcheltree, were, ‘ What have you thrown on the fire, my dear?’ which negatived a previous direction to do the act she had done. Indeed the whole deposition seems to negative a previous direction.</p>

After this Alice begged the testator’s pardon, and promised to burn the will the following morning. The next morning the witness going into the kitchen where Alice and the testator were, heard Alice say, “ There, the thing is finished,” and the testator then told the witness that Alice had thrown the will upon the fire. The witness doubting it, he said, “she threw something with writing upon it, on the fire, but I did not have it in my hands to look at it.” The witness answered, “ I do not think she has thrown itand the testator said, “ I will go to Lantwit if I am alive and well, and make another willadding that Alice should not have his property, and that he had a son nearer to him.

    <p id="b37-6" data-blocks='[["BL_37.4",37,[182,498,1161,562]]]'>It has often been said that the declarations of a party made in the course of a casual conversation with a stranger, are the weakest of all evidence; and surely the character of the evidence is not improved when it purports to consist of admissions against the interest of the person making them, and inconsistent with other allegations made at the same time, and when the channel of proof is through persons pecuniarily interested in establishing the truth of the alleged admissions or declarations. We do not permit this species of evidence of itself to prove a parol contract or parol gift of lands so as to take a case out of the statute of frauds and perjuries; and the reason why it should not be permitted to invalidate a written will devising real estate, is of equal, if not greater weight.</p>
    <p id="b37-7" data-blocks='[["BL_37.5",37,[185,1059,1158,172]]]'>Upon the whole case, we are of opinion that there was no revocation by Dr. Robert Miteheltree of the will in question, and no such evidence of fraud upon the part of Mrs. Jane Miteheltree as to prevent her from taking the estate under the will.</p>
    <p id="b37-8" data-blocks='[["BL_37.6",37,[966,1231,332,42]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
    <p class="judges" id="b37-9" data-blocks='[["BL_37.7",37,[184,1316,1161,132]]]'>Judge Black was present at the argument of this case, but was not a member of the court at the time of the decision. He concurred in the judgment.</p>
