Yet we do not see that even .it applies to this case; for it relates to agents for making and renewing contracts of insurance, and this agent was only for receiving applications. Besides, it does not forbid insurances of this kind; but merely imposes certain public duties on the agents. And the Act of 23d April 1829 does not forbid the contract, but only imposes a tax on the premiums received, and provides for its collection. The Act of 24th. January 1849 seems to us to apply to branch or agency offices or places of business established in this state by companies of other states, and not to mere transient or travelling agents to invite applications to be sent to the company itself; which seems to be the only agency proved here. Thornton sent to the company in Ohio by the agent, his application with his premium note, as his proposal for a policy, and the company accepted it by sending him the policy. For these reasons we must declare that this contract is not forbidden by our law.</p>

In accurate pleading this could not support the plea of <em>non assumpsit </em>without barring the right. We think that the cause was correctly tried.</p>
