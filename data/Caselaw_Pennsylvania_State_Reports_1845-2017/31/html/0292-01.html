By his will, he devised his farm to his widow for life, and after her decease, <em>“ </em>that the proceeds of said farm be and fall unto my brothers and sisters, or their children or heirs at law.” He also bequeathed one-third part of his personal property to his widow, “ and the remainder to be equally divided among my brothers and sisters, or their heirs; that is Henry Yeich, Samuel Yeich, the children of my sister Sarah, late wife of Abraham Reeser, and the children of my sister Susanna, late wife of John Hemmig, deceased, my sister Catharine, and the children of my sister Elizabeth, late wife of Henry Gring, deceased.”</p>

To this report exceptions were filed, and the court below decreed the whole of the fund to the surviving brothers and sister, to the exclusion of the children of the deceased sisters. From this decree the latter took this appeal.</p>

Such is our customary mode of descents, and so we understand such words as the above, unless qualified by other words. In disposing of his personal property, he describes them as “ brothers and sisters or their heirs,” and says that he means his living brothers and sisters, and the children of his deceased sisters; and twice afterwards he calls them “brothers and sisters or their children,” without saying that he means anything different. We have lately presented the principle of interpretation in such a case as this, in Fissel’s Appeal, 27 <em>S. R. </em>55, and we need not repeat it.</p>
