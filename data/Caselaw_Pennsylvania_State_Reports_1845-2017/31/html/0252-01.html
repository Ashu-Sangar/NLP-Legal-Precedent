He has been trained to that very business, and is chosen and commissioned because of his training; whereas, a jury is drawn by lot for the particular occasion, and simply to aid in finding the facts. In this, the duty of the judge is exclusive of the jury, because for this his education and his office are superior.

Express verbal contracts, when fully proved, are naturally as exclusive of implied ones, as if they were written; yet, because of the uncertainty of the oral testimony, by which they must be proved, indirect evidence is admitted to aid in proving or to disprove them, or to raise implied ones if the express ones should fail for want of proof.</p>
    <p id="b259-6" data-blocks='[["BL_259.4",259,[194,826,1165,555]]]'>In all cases, the express contract, written or not, is the paramount law of the parties, and, if complete, must be exclusive; and, if not complete, it must be conclusive so far as it goes, supposing it to be free from mistake and fraud. And where they have provided against all forgetfulness and misconception by putting their own definition of this relation into writing, it is of the very nature of the act that the writing, while it exists, is the exclusive evidence of those relations; for it admits of no uncertainty, and perpetuates the very terms of their agreement, which oral testimony cannot do. It is like a civil law, instituting a new civil relation, and fully defining it, and thus excluding all presumptive aids from prior laws: 22 <em>State Rep. </em>367; <em>Cro. Jac. </em>644; 1 <em>Show. </em>399; 1 <em>Burr. </em>543; 10 <em>Mod. </em>337.</p>

By this we have, in a great degree, set aside the distinction between dependent and independent contracts and covenants, and thus extended the field of inquiry to the whole transaction, of which the particular contract forming the basis of the action, constitutes a part; instead of requiring each party to seek his independent remedy for his portion of it. With us, therefore, parol evidence is often admissible, because it is relevant to our larger subject of investigation; let it affect the aspect or impair the effect that any written portion of the transaction would have by itself, or not. Elsewhere, such evidence would be manifestly irrelevant, and would be rejected for this, rather than because the written evidence excludes it.</p>

Such contracts can be proved only by writing; but they may themselves be only parts of a much more comprehensive transaction; and, so far as remedies are plastic enough to administer the legal and equitable rights growing out of it, its other parts, not required to be in writing, may be proved orally. Promissory notes and bills of exchange must be <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>in writing, and, in form, are usually complete contracts in themselves ; yet, as between the original parties, parol evidence may be given to show that they are only parts of a transaction, so as to admit of the consideration of the collateral rights involved in it. A conveyance of land may be complete for its purpose,, which is to declare and prove the fact of conveyance; yet very naturally and commonly it is but a part execution of a prior contract; and parol evidence is admissible to show the true consideration for which it was given, and all other parts of the transaction, provided the fact of conveyance be not affected by it.</p>

Sometimes direct oral evidence of the intention is allowed, but no such question arises in the present case.</p>

Nor can matters that go in satisfaction and discharge of the writing; for it cannot declare its own fulfilment. Many writings are, in their ordinary purpose, only a part of a transaction; and, instead of showing what the transaction was, are only a means of performing one side of it. Thus, promissory notes, bills of exchange, bonds and mortgages, <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>are often only means of satisfying contracts for the sale of lands or goods, of which conveyances and bills of parcels, with receipts, are the counterpart.

At first, the defence seemed successful; but it was properly rebutted by Hoover’s testimony, which showed that the bond of the defendant did not fully satisfy the consideration, which was $550, and that the unpaid balance was made up by the defendant having taken the land charged with the judgment against Hoover, from whom the plaintiff had bought the lot. Taking the case thus, it was not the plaifitiff’s fault that the lot was sold on that judgment, and this fact furnishes no defence.</p>

The bond must be taken as the evidence of what the defendant finally contracted to pay to the plaintiff, and it excludes the conversations that led to the agreement contained in it, from being evidence of what the agreement was. The defendant has not given us the offers of testimony, in the order in which they were made, and we find it impossible to place them, and, therefore, cannot say whether they were rightly ruled or not. We take Cubbison’s deposition as intended to rebut Hoover’s testimony, and we do not see that it is available for this. Perhaps it confirms it; for it says that the first written bond was objected to for making the defendant liable to the plaintiff “fpr all the money,” and then the one sued on was written in its stead, and was declared satisfactory, and it relates no conversations, as then had, that are inconsistent with this. Besides this, Hoover’s testimony relates to what took place at the final delivery of the papers, and Cubbison’s does not.</p>

Perhaps, as matter of practice, we have erred in our efforts to admit equitable claims and defences in the common law form, and ought to have held that, in cases where a complete legal contract is attempted to be varied by parol evidence, the judge, like the chancellor, can alone declare the sufficiency of the evidence in deciding on its competence; on the principle that the court alone can allow exceptions to the law of the land, and to the private written law of the parties. But this is not such a case; for the plaintiff’s- answer to the defence is a strictly legal one.</p>
