The power of .the legislature, on the ground of sovereignty, or by virtue of the right of eminent domain existing in the state, it is conceded on all hands, may take private property for public use, by making adequate compensation therefor. It is also conceded, that streets in a city, and landings and wharves on the margins of our navigable rivers, are of public utility. And it is not denied that the legislature may, if deemed necessary for public use, by making adequate compensation to the owner, divest a person of his entire title and estate in his property, whenever the public good or convenience may require <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>it. Anything short of this would impair the sovereignty of the state, and limit that power which is said to be illimitable. The only question to be considered is, to what extent did -the legislature exercise this power, in the passage of the act under consideration ? Did they take away the owner’s right of soil — his fee simple —and vest it in the city or the public ? or did they only grant to the city the right to improve, regulate, and control it for the use and convenience of the public, as an easement thereon? The plaintiff’s counsel contends that the former was intended, from the peculiar language employed in the closing sentence of the act, which declares, ‘ and all lots, which previous to the opening of the said way, were bounded by the Allegheny river, shall for ever hereafter be bounded by and front on the way herein authorized to be opened.’ This provision is certainly novel, and such as cannot perhaps be found in any other act on similar subjects, and at first blush seems to countenance the construction contended for by the learned counsel for the plaintiff. But a careful and thorough examination of the whole act, its object and design, has satisfied my mind, that no such intention can fairly be imputed to the legislature.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b39-6" data-blocks='[["BL_39.4",39,[178,1278,1172,1160]],["BL_40.1",40,[276,411,1168,1542]]]'>“ Aside from the necessity for the exercise of any such power, which certainly cannot be claimed in this instance, such a construction would make the statute operate as a fraud upon lot holders, in making their application for damages, by inducing them to believe the public was only to have an easement on their lots, while in fact their entire estate in them was to be divested. And furthermore, the act itself would be unconstitutional, on the ground that no adequate provision is made for compensation for the loss of the entire title. The provision to which I have referred is as follows: ‘ And any person or persons owning lots to which the said way is adjacent, and who shall consider that his, her, or their lot or lots are or shall be <em>damaged by the said </em>location, may make application by petition to the next Court of Quarter Sessions following the publication of the said notice, who shall thereupon appoint twelve discreet and disinterested persons, who being first sworn or affirmed, <em>shall proceed to </em>inquire, on actual view of the premises, <em>whether </em>any, and <em>what damages may or shall be sustained </em>by the persons petitioning, <em>by reason of the opening of said way.’ </em>Thus it appears the only damages provided for are such as shall be sustained by the lot holders, by reason of <em>the location </em>and <em>opening of the </em>street, without any intimation to them that their entire title is to be divested, nor is that fact to enter into the estimate of the viewers, in assessing the damages; and their decision is made final and conclusive. Surely, the legislature could not have meant to deprive the lot holders on the route of that street of their entire title to property worth millions of dollars, without notice of such intention, and provision for a fair and ample compensation. <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>No reason can be imagined why the owners of property on the line of this street should be placed on a different footing from those on any other street in the city. The whole aim and object of the act seems to be to vest in the city for the use of the public the same powers they possess in relation to any other streets in the city. This would place the property holders on that street on a perfect equality Avith those on other streets; and the proper construction, in my opinion, to be given to the last clause of the act, is to limit the <em>exclusive use </em>of the lot holders to the southern line of Duquesne way, giving to the city authorities full and ample power to improve and regulate the ground thus taken, in the manner best calculated to promote the public convenience, AAdthout molestation by the former owners. On the most careful consideration, therefore, I have been able to give to this question, within the brief period alloAved me for its examination, I am clearly of opinion that the fee simple, or residuary estate, remained in the defendant up to the date of his deed, and is now vested in the plaintiff. Nor does the decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Pittsburgh <em>v. </em>Scott, 1 <em>Barr </em>309, weaken that opinion in the slightest degree, because the question now under consideration did not arise in that case, nor Avas it before that court at all. That was an action on the case brought by the city against Scott to recover damages for obstructing Duquesne way, and the main question in the cause was the constitutionality of the act authorizing the laying out and opening that street. There had been a good deal of litigation in regard to the right of the city to open and use this way and landing. The defendant had piled some lumber on the street, and this action was brought merely for the purpose of testing the right of the city to the control of this street. The question noAV under consideration was not raised, nor in any way involved in the determination in that case. Consequently, any expressions used by the learned judge, in delivering the opinion of the court, about the Me or property of the lot holders being vested in the city, are to be understood entirely with reference to the right to control and regulate the same for the use of the public, and not as deciding the question of seisin. .</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b40-6" data-blocks='[["BL_40.4",40,[277,1953,1168,204]]]'>“ Second. The next question is, whether this landing and street were such an encumbrance, or the opening and occupancy of -the same,'by the city, under the authority of the Act of Assembly, amounted to such an eviction, as will render the defendant liable' in this action on his covenant ?</p>

      <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>“ Covenants of this hind are not to be extended by implication, so as to embrace acts done by the sovereign power of the state; but only such as are done by individuals. The state, by virtue of the right of eminent domain, may enter upon and take private property, for public use, by making adequate compensation therefor ; and therefore all contracts about land may fairly be presumed to have been made in reference to this right, and the possibility of its being exercised. It has never been supposed, that the vendor or vendee contemplated a warranty against the exercise of this power, whenever the public good or convenience might require it. This doctrine applies with peculiar force in the present ease, where the property purchased was situated on the bank of a navigable river, in a large and populous .city, extending along its shore for more than a mile, where it required but a small share of forecast to see, that sooner or later, the public necessity would require that shore to be prepared and graded for a wharf or landing for vessels navigating the river. But the purchaser, the plaintiff here, was not left to mere conjecture on that subject; for nearly eight years before the date of his purchase, the legislature had authorized the city to lay out and open this street and wharf; and in 18-39, nearly five years before the date of his deed, the city had exercised that authority by passing the necessary ordinances, and causing plans to be made out and filed in the office of the Clerk of the Quarter Sessions, and of the Recording Regulator, by marking the lines on the ground, and in some parts by opening the street and grading the wharf, appointing a wharf-master, and collecting wharf-age. It was, therefore, no longer a matter of doubt and uncertainty whether the power granted by the Act of 1836, would be fully exercised by the public authorities of the city. But the rule would be the same, whether the authority were given by the legislature before or after the purchase, or given before and not exercised until afterwards; because, as we have already seen, the entire subject is left out of view by both parties in making their contract, or, if taken into consideration at all, the price is regulated with reference to the assertion of this right by the state.</p>

He was bound to know the Act of 31st March 1836,. and all the ordinances duly passed by the councils of the city, and recorded under and in pursuance of that act, as well as the plans of the street and wharf made and filed according to its provisions, and how they affected the property he was about to’purchase.</p>
