In determining what is an unlawful blocking or obstruction of a street or crossing, we must give it a reasonable construction. In one sense, a crossing is obstructed, for the time, while every train is passing; but that is not an <em>unlawful </em>obstruction ; for this, and every company, has a right to the ordinary use of its road. So a train may be stopped by accident, or some unavoidable cause, for a’time, upon a highway, without any violation of the law. But if a train is voluntarily stopped upon a crossing, when there is no present necessity for it, in the ordinary use of the road, and when it might as conveniently have been stopped elsewhere, it undoubtedly is an unlawful blocking or obstruction of the road, within the meaning of the act; and would subject the engineer or agent to the penalty; and while the train would so remain, it would remain an obstruction upon the highway. It would be there, not a ‘spring-gun,’ or any other hidden source of intentional mischief, but simply an obstruction, a visible obstruction on the highway, and a nuisance, because unlawfully there; and, as in the case of any other like obstruction, the company would be accountable to any persons having occasion to. travel the road, for any loss, inconvenience,' or injury which results directly and entirely from its being there. Any one detained, in pursuit of his lawful business,-to his injury, would have a right of action. If, however, through impatience of detention, he should undertake to pass under the ears, when about to move forward, and, not being observed, should be injured, he would have no pretence of claim, for that would be the result of his own reckless folly.</p>

A train of cars was stopped on a road or street that leads into the borough of Huntingdon, and whilst it stood there, the plaintiff’s son, returning from an errand along that road, attempted to pass under the cars.

It is said the court erred, in holding that the Act of Assembly of 20th March 1845, forbidding the obstructing of the crossings of public roads by locomotives and cars, applied to the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, who were incorporated by a subsequent Act of 13th April 1846.</p>
    <p id="b376-13" data-blocks='[["BL_376.13",376,[309,1760,1156,427]]]'>If this were so, if the company were not subject to the Act of 1845, they would have to show legislative authority to justify their blocking up a street. So far from having any such authority, the 13th section of their charter required them to construct their road in such manner as not to impede the passage or transportation of persons or property along any established road. The obstruction which the jury have found in this case was then without authority of law, and therefore illegal. But it was also in plain violation of the Act of 1845, which was a general law, and applicable to the defendants, though subsequently incorporated.</p>

    <p id="b377-7" data-blocks='[["BL_377.5",377,[190,703,1158,258]]]'>This position is answered by the observations that were made on a similar point in Bauch’s case, already referred to. Indeed, the reasoning there applies with more force here, for here the company were engaged in transporting their own cars on their own road.

If you say it was the starting, and not the stopping of the cars, that did the mischief, the question of plaintiff’s negligence in suffering his son to be under them is still in the case, but you have made no progress in the defence, because if there was wrong in the start, the company are as responsible for it as for any wrong in the stop.</p>

It appeared that the horses were descending a hill at the foot of which was a bridge — that they were going at a reasonable speed, and that there were no houses along that part of the road to excite the expectation that people would be found in the road. Under these circumstances the court held, that failing to see the child in time to avert the danger was not culpable negligence, and they reversed the judgment which gave him damages. The case might have been rested on the propriety of the defendant’s conduct. He was pursuing his highway in a lawful and appropriate manner, and that distinguishes the case from ours, for here the wrongdoing of the defendants, in obstructing the highway, is established. But the case is cited for the sake of Judge Cowen’S observations on infantile responsibility, and these I dismiss in the language which Ch. J.

Two boys, in a neighbouring town, went under ears in similar circumstances, and the adjudged cases in the books show that children do frequently incur equal, or even greater, hazards. We cannot, therefore, account this boy’s conduct unnatural or extravagant.</p>

    <p id="b378-9" data-blocks='[["BL_378.7",378,[286,2250,1153,171]]]'>The substance of the instructions was, that the damages must be compensatory merely, and that compensation must have regard to the plaintiff’s loss of his son’s services, and to the expenses of nursing and professional treatment.</p>

      <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>These were the grounds on which the father claimed damages in his declaration, and they were the appropriate grounds on which to assess them. The father was entitled to the services of his child during minority, and by just so much as this injury impaired the value of that right, was he entitled to compensatory damages. This was the only action he could ever maintain, and all his damages were to be assessed herein. For surgical attention and nursing, he was also entitled to compensation on the general principle of <em>quantum meruit.</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b379-6" data-blocks='[["BL_379.4",379,[243,827,1156,257]]]'>It was proper for the jury to understand that the sufferings endured by the boy, and the disfiguration of his form, and whatever was merely personal to him, should not enter into the estimate of the father’s damages, because for these the son would have a right of action. And an appropriate caution was given to the jury on this point, in the body of the charge.</p>
    <p id="b379-7" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[241,1083,1157,518]]]'>But a majority of our number think the court erred in answering the 7th point of the plaintiff. That point called upon the judge to say, that in this action there was no absolute measure of damages, and that the jury might give such damages as they believed to be right to compensate the plaintiff for the loss and injury sustained. The court affirmed this point. They told the jury not to lose sight of the ground of claim as stated in the general charge; but it is clear, that an unqualified affirmance of the 7th point was giving the jury too large a license on the subject of damages, and the verdict proves that they did not heed the reference to the observations contained in the first part of the charge.</p>
    <p id="b379-8" data-blocks='[["BL_379.6",379,[237,1600,1160,341]]]'>Generally speaking, the influence of the court in this class of cases should be exerted to restrain those excesses into which juries are apt to run. The sympathies of the fathers and brothers who compose the jury, are always powerfully excited by the distressing circumstances of the case and the eloquent appeals of counsel. Wild verdicts are frequently rendered. And the tendency in modern times, undoubtedly, is to excessive damages, especially where they are to be assessed against corporations.</p>
    <p id="b379-9" data-blocks='[["BL_379.7",379,[239,1941,1155,212]]]'>It is curious, in looking back, to see how pecuniary mulcts have grown with advancing civilization. The Jewish law abounds with instances of specific damages, but they were generally inconsiderable as compared with modern assessments : <em>Exodus </em>xxi. 32 and 35; xxii. 9.</p>
    <p id="b379-10" data-blocks='[["BL_379.8",379,[236,2154,1156,170]]]'>The same principle of arbitrary and fixed valuation was applied, to a considerable extent, by the civil law, though on the introduction of this code into modern Europe, the discretionary consideration of the tribunal was substituted for the specific valuation.</p>

    <p id="b380-5" data-blocks='[["BL_380.4",380,[244,495,1158,514]]]'>The laws of the Anglo-Saxons applied, with the most minute care, specific damages in each class of cases. Not only was a certain value put by law on every individual which determined the amount at which his testimony as a compurgator was to be rated, and the damage he could claim as plaintiff, or must pay as defendant, but every limb and part of the body had its distinct “ <em>wehr,” </em>or legal worth. Thus a leg was valued at 50 shillings (the shilling was then more than double the value of the present English shilling, and 50 shillings were equal to about $35 of our money), the little finger at 11 shillings, the great toe at 10 shillings, an ear was 12 shillings, each of the front teeth 6 shillings, every finger nail 1 shilling, and so on.</p>
    <p id="b380-6" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[241,1008,1156,426]]]'>In the laws of Alfred, the rates are higher, and under the Conqueror, the <em>wehrs </em>became fewer, until at last specific penalties were reserved almost exclusively for public misdemeanors, and the compensation for private torts came to be measured, as at present, by the discretion of the tribunal applied to all the circumstances of the case. But even after the common law had adopted this discretionary admeasurement of damages, and after the increase of money had depreciated its value, down to a very late period in English- jurisprudence, damages for torts were comparatively low, as may be seen in <em>Viner’s Abr. </em>tit. Damages.</p>
    <p id="Aec8" data-blocks='[["BL_380.6",380,[241,1434,1156,172]]]'>A verdict for $3000 for the loss of a son’s services is not to be found in the old law, and if there are any such instances in modern times, they are comparatively rare. The most recent assessments in England are very much below this rate of compensation.</p>
    <p id="b380-8" data-blocks='[["BL_380.7",380,[239,1606,1156,255]]]'>The courts labour to define the measure of damages with all possible precision, but the application of it must be left to the jury, and unless they are restrained by a firm exercise of the power of new trials, damages will go on increasing, each instance of excess being used to justify the next, until the pecuniary loss of one party will be repaired at the ruin of the other.</p>
    <p id="b380-9" data-blocks='[["BL_380.8",380,[237,1861,1157,555]],["BL_381.1",381,[223,419,1164,217]]]'>Where there has been no oppression, fraud, wantonness, or other circumstance to call for exemplary damages, these large verdicts are a violation of the rule of compensation. And a violation that is just as unpardonable, when practised against a corporation, as against an individual. If any person should wantonly crush the foot of a little boy, I can scarcely conceive of a rate of damages that I would deem too high. But when such a disaster occurs from a merely negligent performance of customary duties, and involves no malicious motive whatever, the rule of law is, that the father is entitled to compensation merely for the pecuniary loss he has sustained. Not compensation for his lacerated, feelings or his disappointed hopes, for the law cannot compensate these in money, but pecuniary indemnity for pecuniary <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>losses. What he spent to cure his boy, and what profit might have accrued to him from his services, more than can be realized after the injury, are the proper elements of a verdict; and they are to be rated none the higher or lower because the defendant happens to be a corporation instead of a natural person.</p>
    <p id="b381-6" data-blocks='[["BL_381.4",381,[224,635,1160,160]]]'>Because the court’s answer to the 7th point was calculated rather to release the jury from this standard, than to hold them to it, the judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>is awarded.</p>
