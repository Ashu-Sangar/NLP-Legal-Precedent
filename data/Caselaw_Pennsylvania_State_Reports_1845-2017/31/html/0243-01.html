These proceedings remained, and were in full force at the date of the bond, and so continued during his life. The question presented by the record is, whether there remained in the obligor, under these circumstances, any power whatever to contract, so as to bind or affect his estate, although at the time of doing so he may have been entirely free from intoxication.</p>

It is not necessary to adduce reasons to prove the self-evident proposition, that, to admit the capacity of control to exist in the lunatic or habitual drunkard over his estate, after inquision, settling his condition, in this respect, or submit it to be controverted by evidence of lucid intervals or sobriety at the moment of contracting, would leave the estates of these unfortunate classes about as much exposed as before <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>proceedings had in regard to them. The inquisition and decree, standing of record, was intended for notice to all the world of the incapacity of the particular party to contract. It is the judgment of the law to this effect, and as a consequence, his acts in regard to his property are absolutely void while the condition exists. He can make no contract that will bind or render it liable to take effect, either in his lifetime or after death, for the reason that the law has settled that the important element of a valid contract does not exist, namely, the capacity to contract. It is this which determines the validity of the contract, whensoever it is to be executed; if wanting then., it continues wanting at the time of performance, unless validated subsequently by some legal act of the party. Witmer, by reason of the decree in force against him at the time he gave the bond, had no legal capacity to contract so as to affect his estate, and hence his contract could not be enforced against his administrators* after his death; it was void.</p>

To contracts during this period the rule applies, and the decree is only <em>primd facie </em>evidence on the question of capacity; after that it is conclusive, until revoked. To this effect is Clark <em>v. </em>Caldwell, <a href="/watts/6/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Watts 139" data-case-ids="1846062" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0139-01">6 <em>Watts </em>139</a>.</p>

The incapacity to contract regards only the estate. Contracts, purely personal, or for others, and not involving the estate, may not be void.
