With privilege to be towed by some other good boat equal to steamboat General Larimer.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b446-13" data-blocks='[["BL_446.13",446,[295,2021,1155,391]]]'>One of the boats was sunk about three miles below <em>Pittsburgh; </em>and for this loss there had been a former recovery on the policy. The other three were taken in tow by the General Larimer, but, owing to the insufficiency of her power, she was unable to manage them; one of the ice-boats, from this cause, was run ashore, and lost, when near the head of Grandview Island; the steamer then proceeded on her voyage with the two remaining boats, and when off Line Island, another of them was lost. And for these losses the two present actions were brought.</p>

      <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>The defendants pleaded, <em>inter </em>alia, a former recovery; to which the plaintiffs replied <em>nul tiel </em>record, and that the recovery was upon another and separate covenant in the policy. To this replication the defendants demurred; which demurrer was overruled, on the ground that the plea itself was had, in not averring the former recovery to have been for the same breach of covenant, and for the same cause of action.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b447-7" data-blocks='[["BL_447.5",447,[171,970,1159,287]]]'>The defendants’ counsel then requested the court to charge the jury : that “ the policy declared on contained an implied warranty that the tow-boat was of sufficient capacity to manage and tow the ice-boats; and if the jury believed from the evidence that she was not of sufficient capacity for the purpose aforesaid, and the loss resulted from such cause, the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover.”</p>

There was a verdict and judgment in favour of the plaintiffs in one case for $1654.25; and in the other for $1636.25; whereupon the defendants removed the causes to this court, and here assigned: 1. The overruling of the defendants’ demurrer; 2. The rejection of the record of the former suit; 3. The refusal of the court below to charge the jury as requested.</p>

Yet they are insurable on a voyage.</p>

Ice-boats, without the assistance of a tow-boat, are much more unmanageable than with it; and yet they are not treated, as unseaworthy. Tow-boats may be intended only as a partial cure of this.defect; and we find that the hands of the coal-boats were with them. Considering this, and that this one boat was to tow four of such unwieldy craft, we should rather infer that no more was intended in this instance.</p>
