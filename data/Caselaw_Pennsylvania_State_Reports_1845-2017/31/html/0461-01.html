The defendant appealed to the Common Pleas, from the judgment of the justice.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b462-7" data-blocks='[["BL_462.5",462,[277,667,1149,132]]]'>David Williams, the defendant, was a contractor on the Northwestern Railroad. During the year 1856, the work was carried on by John O’Leary, who acted as his general manager.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b462-8" data-blocks='[["BL_462.6",462,[275,796,1150,374]]]'>On the 5th May 1856, O’Leary made a contract with Getty, the plaintiff, for the labour of a two-horse team and driver, in the prosecution of the work, for a period of four to five months, at $3.50 per day. After working for 17-2- days, O’Leary discharged the driver, without cause, paying him for the time he had worked. The team remained idle for 19J days, before the plaintiff could find other employment for it. And this action was brought to recover damages sustained by reason of the defendant’s breach of contract.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b462-10" data-blocks='[["BL_462.8",462,[275,1265,1153,851]]]'>“ If a man appoint an agent with general power to transact any business, the acts of the agent are the acts of the principal, in any matter within the terms of his authority; and if the principal holds the agent out to the world as a general agent in the transaction of his business, any contract he would make within the scope of that business would be binding on the principal, although there might be, as between the principal and agent, a restriction upon the general authority of the latter, and the person with whom the contract was made had no notice of such restriction. It is not to be expected, that persons dealing with an agent carrying on a general business, such as a general manager of a contractor on a railroad, would be bound to inquire the particulars of the agent’s appointment and authority, when he is held out to the world as such general agent, particularly when the principal has been back and forward inspecting the progress of the work, and making no objection, nor giving any notice of the restricted authority of such agent. A different rule would enable the principal to affirm or deny at pleasure. If the contract was a favourable one, he could ratify it, and hold the other party liable; if unfavourable, he could repudiate it and escape from responsibility.</p>

This is for the jury. If they believe there was, they <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>will then determine whether that contract was violated by the defendant, by discharging him before the expiration of the time specified by the contract. If so, the defendant would be liable for damages. The evidence shows that the team was out of employment in consequence of the discharge, some nineteen, or nineteen and a half days; when it was otherwise engaged. If the jury believe this, then the loss to the defendant would be the wages of the team agreed upon during that period.</p>

And this raises the question, whether the practice restricted the authority of the agent, or whether, being a general agent, he was within the scope of his authority in contracting for tibe usual and ordinary means of accomplishing the business. His business was to advance to completion the work under his care, and this was to be done by the employment of labourers and teamsters. This was apparent and palpable to all, and being so, it is difficult to conceive, of any duty resting on a party about contracting to assist in the accomplishment of what the agent had power to do, namely, to construct <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>the portion of the road under his charge, other than to see that he was engaging to do what was usual in such business. The authority of a general agent to contract is implied in the nature and kind of business he has to do, and is only limited to the necessary and appropriate means of accomplishing it. If it were such a business as it was apparent would last but six months, a contract for a year doubtless would not be binding on the principal, because the party employed would be acting in bad faith, in undertaking when it was apparent he would not be needed; and besides, it would be equally apparent that such a contract was not necessary to the accomplishment of the object. So, if the business were such as would apparently last for months, an employment for one or more months would seem to all to be covered by the agent’s implied authority, and would bind.</p>

The principle is elementary and uniform, that an implied general authority to transact business is only limited to the usual and ordinary means of accomplishing it. This doctrine is not to be confounded with that regulating special agents for limited purposes. There the extent of the authority must regulate the validity of the contract, and one who deals with such an agent must look to that.</p>
