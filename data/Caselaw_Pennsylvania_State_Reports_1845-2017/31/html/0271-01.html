In that case the endorsers were administrators. The holders did no act for a number of years by which it was indicated that they Iooke'd to the endorsers for payment; and when suit was at length brought, the lands of the maker had ceased to be a fund for the payment of debts. The endorsers were therefore injured by not receiving notice. Judge Duncan, in his opinion, page 162, puts the case upon the peculiar position of the administrator: <em>“ </em>The lands, the fund here for the payment of debts, do not come into the possession of the administrator ; he has no right of entry, and can bring no ejectment; the possession descends to the heir. The executor or administrator have, by virtue of thgir office, in no case a right to the possession of the deceased’s lands.”</p>

The whole estate came into the hands of the executors. They were authorized by the will to sell all their testator’s estate, real, personal and mixed. The lands, therefore, came into their possession.</p>

That case might have been decided upon its special circumstances, but it was not. It follows the rule that requires that payment of a note shall be demanded of the maker at maturity, and that notice of its dishonour shall be immediately given to the endorser, and refuses to make an exception in a case where, during the currency of the note, the maker dies, and the endorser becomes his administrator.</p>

In such cases, he will have to pay first or last, notice or no notice, and therefore notice can be of no use to him, and its omission can do him no harm: 19 <em>State R. </em>400; 23 <em><a href="/watts-serg/4/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 328" data-case-ids="1856487" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0328-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/watts-serg/4/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 328" data-case-ids="1856487" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0328-01">476</a>.</p>
    <p id="b273-7" data-blocks='[["BL_273.5",273,[204,1278,1168,601]]]'>The principle of such exceptions does not apply to an*%ndorser, who, during the currency of the note, becomes the executor or administrator of the maker. As executor he is not personally bound, and the purpose of demand and notice is to make him so, and to warn him of the fact that the holder looks to him individually. This may not aid him in saving anything out of the maker’s estate; but it warns him to calculate and arrange his own with reference to it. Without such notice, most of men, when they are not themselves the true debtors, would suppose themselves discharged, and would be very much surprised to find themselves, after five years perhaps, as it was in The Bank <em>v. </em>Hale, or perhaps after the maker’s estate had been distributed to other creditors, sued as endorsers. We see no adequate reason for making this case an exception to the general rule.</p>
