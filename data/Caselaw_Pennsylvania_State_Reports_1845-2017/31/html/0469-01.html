    <p id="b470-9" data-blocks='[["BL_470.13",470,[451,1343,1158,418]]]'>It is objected, that the declaration is not good; and that is true. It is good for nothing; for it tells us nothing valuable about the claim. We treat it, therefore, as no declaration at all. And as the parties did not notice it on the trial, we may take them as treating it in the same way. A declaration that has only blanks at the places where definite averments ought to be, is no declaration. But parties may try appeal cases without pleadings, and we must regard.them as having done so in this instance; and the defendant cannot now raise the objection that the essential parts of the declaration are blank.</p>
