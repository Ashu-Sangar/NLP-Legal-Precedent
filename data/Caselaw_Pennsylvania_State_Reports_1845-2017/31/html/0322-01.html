One of these witnesses was Jacob Stultzfoos, who had been one of the executors of Michael Lapp, but who had been .previously discharged by the Orphans’ Court, on his own application.

The <em>narr. </em>was drawn on the penal part of the bond, and set it forth according to its legal effect and meaning. It was not necessary for the plaintiff to set out the condition of <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>tbe bond. If the defendant meant to plead performance of the condition, he should have brought it upon the record by craving oyer of the bond and its condition. But being for the payment, not of instalments, nor for the performance of collateral conditions, but of a round sum of money, on a certain day, the bond was sufficiently set forth in the narr., and the omission of its condition was no objection to its admission in evidence: 1 <em>Saund.

The bond was overdue when the alteration was made, and the drawers were legally subject to 6 per cent, interest thereon. The making it 4f, therefore, was beneficial to them, of which they have no reason to complain.</p>

Jacob Stultzfoos, though named as one • of Lapp’s executors, had renounced the trust and been discharged by the court.
