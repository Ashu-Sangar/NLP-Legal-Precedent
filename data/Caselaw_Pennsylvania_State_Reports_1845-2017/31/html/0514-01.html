    <p class="summary" id="b514-8" data-blocks='[["BL_514.7",514,[307,1010,1158,298]]]'>In 1834, William Clark was the owner of the lands of both parties; and on the 19th May in that year, conveyed 33 acres of the tract to Nathaniel McKelvey. This deed contained a provision that McKelvey should have the right and privilege to convey the water from his machinery into the natural channel of the creek, through the other lands of the grantor, to any point that may be considered necessary for discharging said water.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b514-9" data-blocks='[["BL_514.8",514,[307,1307,1157,173]]]'>McKelvey erected his machinery on the land, and dug a race from it through Clark’s other land to the creek ; and on the 12th March 1853, conveyed his land to John Moorhead, reciting Clark’s deed to him, with the privilege above-mentioned.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b514-10" data-blocks='[["BL_514.9",514,[308,1480,1157,132]]]'>Clark sold the residue of the tract to Mechling Lobingier; who, on the 4th February 1850, conveyed five acres of it, being the <em>locus in quo, </em>to Frederick Snyder, the plaintiff.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b514-12" data-blocks='[["BL_514.11",514,[306,1780,1157,471]]]'>The court below (Buffington, P. J.) charged the jury, that by the grant, McKelvey was to have his choice of selecting the route, and of digging his race from his machinery to such point as might be “ considered necessary.” But having once made that choice and selected his route, and used it for a number of years before the plaintiff bought, the grant was exhausted by such selection and use, and he could not at any subsequent period enter and construct any additional race. And, therefore, the defendants were not justifiable, under said grant, to enter and commit the trespass in this case, and the plaintiff was entitled to recover, as the entry was not disputed.</p>

No man can reasonably be presumed to have so intended by such a grant. It is a right that is transitory, as to position, only until the race is once made. It would be an incitement to litigation for the law to treat such an easement as a shifting one, and would greatly depreciate the land on which it is charged and discourage its improvement.</p>
