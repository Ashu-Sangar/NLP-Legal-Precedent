In this we suppose there was error. An obligation for the payment of money merely requires the tender to be made to the obligee. But if, before the day of payment, the parties agree by parol, that the money should be paid to a third person at his house; or that the obligor and obligee should meet at a particular place to pay and receive the money; can it be said that such agreement cannot be proved; and that payment to the third person, or a tender at the place agreed on, is not good ?

    <p id="b267-12" data-blocks='[["BL_267.13",267,[209,2277,1167,174]],["BL_268.1",268,[291,423,1167,689]]]'>As neither statutes, nor other written evidences of relations, can be expected to express the whole intention of those who frame them, and especially when they are providing for unknown future exigencies; or to express it always with grammatical accuracy; <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>and as some thoughts are almost sure to he left for inference and implication, according to the nature of the relation, and of the circumstances that may arise; interpretation naturally divides itself into two essentially different functions. One of these is interpretation proper, which merely defines the intention expressed by the words of the writing; and the other is construction, which, by implication or presumption, adds to or corrects the expressed thoughts, so as to supply what has been omitted, and to reform mistakes according to the presumed intention. This division corresponds approximately to the terms grammatical and logical, literal and rational, declarative and extensive interpretation, made use of by authors who treat specially of the subject. This distinction is noticed everywhere; and it is marked even in the Roman law, when it says that such defects are to be supplied by interpretation, or at least by judicial decision <em>(vel interpretations vel certe jurisdictione suppleri): Dig. </em>1, 3, 13.</p>
    <p id="b268-6" data-blocks='[["BL_268.4",268,[290,1111,1173,717]]]'>Now, interpretation ascertains the intention as it is written, and construction holds itself in harmony with this intention in supplying omitted expressions and correcting erroneous ones. And, for this, the circumstances are necessary, and this is expressly said by Mr. Justice Ross, in treating of a case of this class: 2 <em>Pa. R. </em>65. The construction that fixes the place of delivery is not a mere arbitrary one, else it would disregard all circumstances not expressed in the rule; but it is founded on presumptions and inferences of a true intention of the parties. Kent says (2 <em>Comm. </em>507), “ If the place intended by the parties can be inferred, the creditor has no right to appoint a different one. But, if none be designated, and none can be clearly inferred from collateral circumstances, the creditor may designate a reasonable place.” And again: “ The place is that, which circumstances shall show to be suitable and convenient for the purpose intended, and presumptively in contemplation of the parties when the contract was’ made.”</p>

Littleton had said, that <em>money </em>must be tendered to the creditor personally; and Coke adds, but bulky and heavy articles, not ¿620 money, but twenty quarters of wheat, or twenty loads of lumber, are not to be carried about seeking after the creditor; but the debtor must ask him where he wants them. This means only that, when the debtor is bound to tender performance, he is not bound to take up his wheat or furniture, or other article which he cannot conveniently carry about his person, or drive about his ox or horse, and seek out his creditor in person and tender it, as he would money; but should ask him to appoint a reasonable place to receive it. He decides nothing about the construction of the contract; but supposes a case where the debtor is bound to tender a spe.eific article, and then directs how this is to be done. He declares a proper form of tendering performance as a means of avoiding penalties, or litigation; and not at all an absolute rule for construing the intent of the contract. That is no <em>definition </em>of a duty, that depends upon so indefinite a term as “ portable articles.”</p>

It might then be understood as a purchase of two horses by the plaintiff from the defendant, and a payment therefor in horses, for which money was to be substituted if the horses did not turn out according to expectation. Viewing it thus, perhaps it is not so plain that the construction is against the defendant; for, if the horses should not suit, the plaintiff would not be entitled to them without paying $400, and notice would be sufficient to call him to this duty. If they did not suit, he became the debtor.</p>

And, in their general character, they do not exclude parol evidence; but are substitutes for the want of it.

Some that were not noticed by them are quite direct in favour of our view: 2 <em>Fairf. </em>398; <a href="/cow/5/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="5 Cow. 506" data-case-ids="2032873" data-case-paths="/cow/5/0506-01">5 <em>Cow. </em>506</a>; <a href="/us/26/0089-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="1 Pet. 89" data-case-ids="1432399" data-case-paths="/us/26/0089-01">1 <em>Pet. </em>89</a>. And Chipman, when corrected as we have suggested, becomes express in favour of it, saying, where the law fixes no <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>place, “ the contract (fixing none) must he considered imperfect, and parol evidence may be admitted to prove at what place the parties agreed the property should be delivered:” p. 27. Perhaps the rejection of oral evidence to show the <em>time </em>of payment, on an instrument where no time is fixed, <a href="/johns/8/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="8 Johns. 189" data-case-ids="2134511" data-case-paths="/johns/8/0189-01">8 <em>Johns. </em>189</a>, <a href="/mass/49/0097-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="8 Met. 97" data-case-ids="1964752" data-case-paths="/mass/49/0097-01">8 <em>Met. </em>97</a>, is not in conflict with our view, for an absolute promise to pay a debt means, in terms and not by construction, that it is due <em>now. </em>According to the case, we must reverse this judgment, and give judgment for the defendant.</p>
