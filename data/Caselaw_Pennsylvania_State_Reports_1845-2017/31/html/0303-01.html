      <em>certiorari. </em>Even if the relationship did appear upon the record, it would not avail. The exception is too late. It should have been made before the commissioners reported. Not having been made then, it is like a challenge waived. A party cannot take the chance of a favourable report, and failing, make use after-wards of an objection which would have been fatal in the beginning : 6 <em>Harris </em>233.</p>
    <p id="b304-3" data-blocks='[["BL_304.4",304,[280,713,1163,685]]]'>The second exception is equally without foundation. The 14th section of the Act of April 15, 1834, provides for the appointment of commissioners in three distinct cases: <em>first, </em>when an application is made for the purpose of erecting â–  a new township ; <em>second, </em>when application is made to alter the line of any township; and, <em>third, </em>when application is made to ascertain and establish the lines or boundaries of any township. The prescribed duties of the commissioners are peculiar to each case. It is only in the first, that they are required to make a plot or draft of the township proposed to be laid off. The present is a proceeding of the second class, in which the commissioners are required only to make a plot of the lines of the two adjoining townships proposed to be altered. This they have done, and the statutory requisitions have therefore' been complied with. A draft of the whole township is essential for no useful purpose. Every part of it is already on record, except the altered lines.</p>
