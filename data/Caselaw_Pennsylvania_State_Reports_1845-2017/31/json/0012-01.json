He ought to be required to keep it up so long as he alone uses it, and if the owner uses it in common with him, it ought to be kept up at the common expense, and so ordered.\nOrder reversed and procedendo awarded.",

The points raised and decided appear sufficiently in the opinion of the court, delivered in September, 1854.\nBarton for plaintiff in error, Henderson.\nMarshall $ Brown, for petitioner."
