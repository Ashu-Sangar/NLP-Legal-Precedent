R. 292; a case which has twice before been misunderstood: 7 Watts 170 ; 12 State R. 381. All that is decided there is, that a justice of the peace has no jurisdiction of an action of tort for such negligence where the claim is over $100. No one doubts that assumpsit will lie in such a case; for the law implies a contract for care and skill, not as a fiction, but as a fact, from the \u201c understanding,\u201d 13 S. & R. 44, or \u201c course of dealing between the parties;\" 17 Id. 371; 6 Watts 387. This declaration is plainly in assumpsit. And certainly, when the law gives jurisdiction to justices \u201c of all causes of action arising from contract, express or implied,\u201d it means to include such cases as this; else an action for carelessly soldering a tin bucket would be beyond the judicial competence of a justice. Other analogous cases show plainly enough that the justice has jurisdiction. 6 Watts 47; 7 Id. 175, 542.\nJudgment reversed and judgment for plaintiff with costs.",

The declaration charged that the plaintiff \u201c retained and employed\u201d the defendant to iron his wagon, and the defendant \u201c undertook and promised to do it with care and skill;\u201d and the breach assigned was, that \u201cnot regarding his promise and undertaking,\u201d he did not do it with proper care and skill. The plea was non assumpsit. On the trial the plaintiff had a verdict for $10 ; and afterwards the court dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction in the justice of the peace, and this is the matter complained of.\n1854,\nWeeeh, for plaintiff.\nSowell, for defendant."
