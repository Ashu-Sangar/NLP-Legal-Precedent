    <p class="summary" id="b516-8" data-blocks='[["BL_516.7",516,[337,859,1156,294]]]'>This was a bill in equity by Richard S. Coxe against The President, Directors, and Company of the Bank of Pennsylvania, and against William C. Patterson, William Lyttleton Savage, and John D. Taylor, assignees of the said bank, to restrain them from receiving the notes of the bank in payment of the debts due to it, and which passed to the assignees by virtue of a general assignment in trust for the benefit of creditors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b516-9" data-blocks='[["BL_516.8",516,[336,1158,1157,175]]]'>The bill set forth that the complainant was the holder of Mary Reeside’s check on the bank for $15,000, dated 26th October 1857, which was presented and marked “good” by the paying teller; and that payment was subsequently demanded and refused.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b516-10" data-blocks='[["BL_516.9",516,[333,1332,1158,685]]]'>That on the 17th February 1858, the bank, having been insolvent since the 25th September 1857, and having during the interval suspended specie payments, made a general assignment for the benefit of its creditors. That a large proportion of the assets so assigned consisted of debts due to the bank, and that unless these debts were collected by the assignees, there would remain a very small sum, if any, out of which the debts due by the bank, or even a dividend thereon, could be paid by the assignees. And the complainant charged that it was the duty of <em>the </em>assignees to collect the said debts for that purpose; whereas the assignees denied that such was their duty, and pretended that they were required by law to receive payment in the notes issued by the bank. The complainant denied that such notes could be lawfully used in paying debts due to the bank before the assignment; and prayed for an injunction to restrain the assignees from receiving the same in payment, &amp;c.</p>

And besides, it would be totally impossible for this court to perform the duties already imposed upon it, if it should open its doors for applications of this character.</p>
