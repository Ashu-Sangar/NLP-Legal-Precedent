Were the question <em>res integra, </em>or were we making a new system, there might be much reason for holding that the amount due on a mortgage, and the question whether it has been paid, should depend solely on what appears on the face of the mortgage or of the bond, and it might be said to be a violation of the statute of frauds, and of the rules of evidence, to permit the effect of a written instrument, solem’nly executed for the purpose of binding land, to be varied or controlled by oral or extrinsic evidence. But the step once taken, of permitting a mortgage to be held as security for future or collateral undertakings, not expressed in its terms, I am at a loss to see, why it should be limited to the advances which it was originally meant to secure, and should not be permitted to extend to others, made at a subsequent period. Suppose a mortgage given as security or indemnity, for the endorsement of a note, which, on falling due, is taken up by another note taken or endorsed, or a sum of money advanced on the faith of the mortgage, must we hold that the mortgage is extinguished, by the very transaction which was meant to give it continuance ? Under these circumstances, the mortgage still subsists in full force as a common law conveyance — the condition of defeasance has not been performed; there is no release on reconveyance, nor any satisfaction of record which, under our system, is equivalent to a reconveyance. If the mortgagor can claim to hold the land free from the lien of the debt, it can only be on the ground of a legal <a id="p380" href="#p380" data-label="380" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*380</a>or equitable payment. At law there is no payment, because the bond itself has not been paid, and equity certainly would not view the extinguishment of the note as payment, contrary to the justice of the case, and the meaning of the parties. I do not speak of the case where the amount or balance due by the mortgagor is fully paid off, with the express or implied intent of satisfying the mortgage, and when the creation of the new debt, or the subsequent advance is an after thought, and mean to confine my remarks to those cases where one advance or debt is substituted for another, with a view of prolonging, and not of taking away, the vitality of the instrument on which the creditor relies for security.</p>
    <p id="b380-6" data-blocks='[["BL_380.5",380,[286,927,1156,512]]]'>“ Here the mortgage is not paid, because payment is a question of agreement and intention, and the effect of the transaction is a mere continuance of the obligation of the bond in the same form, although for a somewhat different purpose. Such, at least, is the view taken by the majority of the court, who are consequently of opinion, that the agreement, by which Godwin’s share of the mortgaged premises was to stand as a security for his separate debt, was valid, and leaves the mortgage in full force, so far as Godwin is concerned, although paid and satisfied as to Brown. The exceptions to the report are sustained, so far as they relate to one-half the fund in court, which is awarded to McHenry, the residue going in the course intended by the auditor.”</p>

They were also co-partners in trade under the firm of Brown &amp; Godwin. The co-partnership became indebted to a considerable amount to the firm of George McHenry &amp; Co. To secure them in respect to this indebtedness, Brown &amp; Godwin gave them four mortgages on real estate, all of which they held as tenants in common in fee in equal proportions. At the time when these mortgages were thus given, Godwin, one of the defendants, was indebted to the firm of George McHenry &amp; Co.

We seek no reconveyance of the premises or formal release of the condition as a means of satisfying it. Payment is a good and equitable plea, and as effectual to it as to any other obligation: Ackla <em>v. </em>Ackla, 6 <em>Barr </em>228.</p>
    <p id="b383-10" data-blocks='[["BL_383.12",383,[197,1162,1163,987]]]'>In the case in hand, the assignee of Brown &amp; Godwin, in effect, interposes this plea, so far as Brown is concerned, and with just the same legal consequences as if he himself, never having assigned, were interposing it. The plea, if made out, would defeat the mortgage, and of course its lien. Brown &amp; Godwin were tenants in common of the property when they executed the mortgage to McHenry &amp; Co. Its purpose was to secure to the latter the payment of a debt due by the firm of Brown, Godwin &amp; Co., of which they were members. In process of time the debt, for which the mortgage was given as collateral, was paid off. Instead of satisfying it, Godwin agreed with McHenry &amp; Co., to whom he was indebted in his individual capacity, that they should hold the mortgage as collateral, to secure that indebtedness. To effect this he was to have McHenry &amp; Co. credited on his firm books with the amount of his debt, but this he never did. It was proved by the auditor that Brown was an entire stranger to the arrangement. Under these circumstances, the question for decision is, whether Godwin the co-tenant of the property could keep the mortgage on foot for his individual benefit, and change its entire purpose without the assent or knowledge of Brown. A simple statement of the proposition is the best refutation of such a position. It was contended for here, and had been in the court below, but was there ruled, and rightly so, as untenable.</p>

But it is difficult to see how this could be done without prejudicially involving Brown’s interest. In case of proceedings to recover the money on the mortgage under such arrangement, the <em>sei.fa. </em>would be against the parties to it — the judgment would have to follow the writ — the <em>levari </em>

      <em>facias, </em>the judgment, and the sale would be of the premises against which judgment was recovered. So that the effect of keeping it on foot would, in case of adverse proceedings, he to sell Brown’s property to reach the lien against Godwin, and that without the assent, express or implied, of the former. This test proves, we think, that McHenry &amp; Co. had no security under the mortgage for Godwin’s individual debt, and was not entitled to any portion of the money in court.</p>

The mortgage was given by two, as tenants in common for a specific purpose. One of the parties to it attempts to change its condition, in fact, to make it a new security for an entirely different purpose, it having sub-served the object of its creation, and to limit its extent to an undivided moiety instead of an entirety, with an indefinite duration as to time. All this was to rest in parol, and would constitute in fact, if valid, an oral mortgage. It is settled that no such security exists in Pennsylvania: Bowers <em>v. </em>Oyster, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20P.%20R.%20240" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 P. R. 240">3 <em>P.
