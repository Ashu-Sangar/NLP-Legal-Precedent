As the lease commenced on the 25th day of March 1751, the one hundred years, being the length of the term, expired, not counting the change of style, on the 25th of March 1851. Throughout that whole period, <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>it is now admitted, that the rent reserved was regularly paid, and that since the expiration of the term it has been fully tendered up to the spring of 1857. In pursuance of the authority granted in the lease to Orozer, he, and those holding under him, went on, erected a dam and built mills, which subsequently have been changed into cotton mills, two in number, worth, according to an intelligent witness, $11,500. In this condition of things, the plaintiff, owner and possessor of the Sharpless tract, with all its rights and liberties, and the defendants, • owning a small tract below, whereon are erected cotton factories, and holding, as they conceive, by the lease aforesaid, certain rights on the plaintiff’s property, are before you, contending for their respective rights. It is somewhat difficult to understand the location and boundaries of the half acre of land for which this action is brought. The declaration of the plaintiff describes it as ‘ a certain lot of land situate in the township of Nether Providence, in Delaware county, containing half an acre of land, or thereabouts, opposite to land late of James Orozer, now of and in the possession of George Lewis, Mordecai Lewis and John Reece Lewis, on the other side of Orum creek, and adjoining to the said creek, above the road leading from Darby through Springfield to Providence, between the said road, and the first turn in the aforesaid Crum creek.’ In the lease, in addition to the foregoing description, it is further stated as being ‘ a laurel hill,’ and this may well increase the difficulty as to the location. So far as the main question in the cause is concerned, there can be no difficulty, however, in discovering the extent of the claim of the plaintiff, and the proper location thereof. •</p>
    <p id="b283-6" data-blocks='[["BL_283.6",283,[202,1623,1162,815]],["BL_284.1",284,[315,407,1156,213]]]'>“ In his second point, furnished me, he says: — £ The erection of the dam-breast, making of the dam, quarrying of the stone, are evidence of the location of the said half acre; and the maintenance of the dam-breast, the reparation thereof, and the maintenance and use of the dam up to the present time, are evidence of the possession by the grantees and their assigns of the said ground now occupied by the dam-breast, the dam and the quarry.’ This will show the claim now made by the plaintiff. I think this is true, and just so far as you may consider the proof of possession sufficient, the defendants have had, and still have such possession as will support the action of ejectment. The lease given in evidence, is a lease of the half acre of land to be located by the lease within the limits specified. The payment of rent by the present holders of the land, during the term mentioned in the lease, is evidence that the defendants were in actual possession of the premises mentioned in the lease, or so much thereof as was located aforesaid, and estops the defendants from denying their possession or our recovery of title. The lease is a lease of the half acre of land, with the privilege to open a quarry, and flood <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>land, which a tenant for years, independent of the grant of such privileges could not do without committing waste; and the said privilege is not an incident to the grant of the soil, and is not in the construction of the instrument to be separated from the principal subject of the grant.</p>

Two men agree, in the most solemn form known to the law, one to demise certain premises, and the other to hold them, and pay rent. More closely considered, the instrument is a lease of land suitable for the breast of a dam, and the grant of an easement, namely, the right to overflow certain other land with water. In the body of the paper, it is expressly provided that the lessee, his heirs and assigns, may hold the said premises, liberties, and privileges, so long as he and they shall think proper, after the expiration of the term therein mentioned, on condition of paying rent. During the term, the lessee and his successors engaged in manufacturing enterprises unknown when the lease was signed, and for this nurpose they erected extensive improvements at large cost. After a century had elapsed, they were notified to quit, and sued in ejectment. The court below, notwithstanding the stipulation quoted, thought the plaintiff entitled to recover the land occupied by the dam-breast, and by the water of the dam west of a line defined in the charge. If the principle on which that opinion was founded be sound, it will fall with a heavy hand on the large manufacturing and mining interests of the country, in the conduct of which leases of this nature are extremely common, and we are bound to investigate it with care.</p>

The earlier leases at will were all held at the will of the lessor. At a later period this modification was effected: “ When a lease is made to have and to hold at the will of the lessor, the law implieth it to be at the will of the lessee also, for it cannot be only at the will of the lessor, but it must be at the will of the lessee also. And so it is when a lease is made to have and to hold at the will of the lessee: this must be also at the will of the lessor; and so are all the books that seem, <em>primé facie </em>to differ, clearly reconciled:” <em>Go. Lit. </em>55 a. In Lord Mansfield’s day, a lease for seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years, as the lessee might choose, was held good for only seven years: <em>Bacon, Abr. </em>

Afterwards a lease for three, six, or nine years was adjudged a lease for nine years, determinable at the intermediate periods by <em>either </em>party: Goodwright <em>v. </em>Richardson, 3 <em>T. R. </em>463. It has since been settled that when a term of seven, fourteen, or twenty-one years has been appointed, and nothing said respecting its termination at the intermediate periods, the lessee only can determine it: Doe <em>v. </em>Dickson, 9 <em>East </em>15; Dann <em>v. </em>Spurrier, 7 <em>Vesey </em>231.</p>
    <p id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[332,765,1155,1068]]]'>These decisions were pronounced in cases of ordinary letting, where the occupancy is an equivalent for the rent, and where, on the determination of the estate, the parties find themselves where they expected. The present is a different case. The lessee received from the hand of the lessor a clear and positive covenant of occupancy, first for a fixed term, and then for an uncertain one determinable only at the will of the former. Eor this covenant he paid full consideration in the rent punctually discharged for a century, and subsequently tendered on the trial of the cause. He went further, and furnished an overwhelming consideration in the detriment which must flow from the destruction of improvements erected with the lessor’s own knowledge and by his agreement ; for the water-power could have been purchased and employed for no other purpose. To permit the tenant’s expulsion from rights like these, without compensation, would violate all the analogies of the law; for while a tenant who expends money on the mere expectation of renewing his term, cannot thus arm himself with a right, Pilling <em>v. </em>Armitage, 12 <em>Vesey </em>85; Watson <em>v. </em>The Hospital, 14 <em>Vesey </em>333; it is equally true, that an owner will not be permitted fraudulently to encourage the occupier of an estate to lay out his money in improvements; Norway <em>v. </em>Rowe, 9 <em>Vesey </em>159; Matts <em>v. </em>Hawkins, 5 <em>Taunton </em>23; and the latter will even be protected in the possession of the estate for any term which he was thus encouraged to expect: Shine <em>v. </em>Gough, 1 <em>Ball &amp; Beatty </em>444.</p>

Two of our sister states have taken the lead in nearly this direction.
