The Acts of Assembly in relation to mechanics’ liens, establish a system altogether out of the course of the common law; and upon points, evidently not foreseen by the legislature, and upon which the statutes have not spoken, the only grounds of decision to which we can resort, must be the general scope and spirit of the enactments, the analogy of cases which have already been settled, and such considerations of policy as may be supposed to have had their influence on the minds of the law makers.

On a part of this lot he commenced the erection of a building, intended as a manufactory for making saws by hand. After he had commenced, and before he had completed this building, he determined to enlarge his plan so as to carry on his business with steam power. This change made necessary a number of additional buildings adjoining that first contemplated, and a very considerable outlay of money'. Accordingly an engine house, with a costly steam engine, and other buildings, were then commenced and erected. Before the original building was finished, <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>though it would seem, after he had entertained the design of enlargement, Conaway, who had been carrying on the business of manufacturing saws by hand at another place, moved into the premises. The mechanics’ claims up to this time were all discharged, and Conaway raised on mortgage of the entire lot the sum of $2175. No part of the intended improvements was then begun on the ground. Subsequently, however, to their commencement he raised other sums of money <em>on </em>mortgage, and several judgments were entered against him. The mechanics engaged in constructing the enlargement filed their claims against the entire lot and buildings. The questions then are, whether their claims are valid liens, and if they are, to what period of time do they relate, the commencement of the first building, or the commencement of what I shall term, for convenience sake, the enlargement ?</p>
    <p id="b124-6" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[324,1015,1161,728]]]'>“ As far as material to the determination of these questions, the auditor reports as facts, and no issue having been demanded as to these facts, we assume them to be correct, that when the first building was commenced it was no part of the plan of the proprietor to make this enlargement; there may have <em>been </em>in his mind a vague hope or expectation that at some future period, when his increase of capital would enable him to do so, he would extend his establishment, and introduce steam as the power by which to carry it on, but there was nothing beyond this, except that the plan may have been originally framed so that such an alteration might afterwards be conveniently made. It is also reported as a fact by the auditor that the change in question was a very material one — the character of the design was different, and that when the whole was done it formed ‘ an establishment in the same sense and effect as a mill, the machinery of which is driven by one engine placed in a separate house, and so that they would all pass by a deed under the description of a saw factory.’</p>
    <p id="b124-7" data-blocks='[["BL_124.6",124,[314,1742,1168,687]],["BL_125.1",125,[195,417,1178,1811]]]'>“ We are clearly of opinion that the claims of mechanics employed upon the enlargement, ought not to be held to relate to the commencement of the original building. If they can, then the mechanics and material men who trusted to the credit of the first structure, and based that credit, as they well might do, upon the fact that it was a reasonable and moderate enterprise, suited to the capital and resources of the owner, would be obliged by a .'subsequent change of plan and a wild scheme of expansion, to lose a large part of their claims, and come in only <em>pro rata </em>with subsequent liens to an indefinite amount. There would be thus no limit to the power of the owner to involve them by subsequent changes of his plans. The true point of view to regard this question, by which to test the soundness of the principle to be applied to it, is to consider it as though it were a contest between mechanics and material men who had done their work, and furnished their materials on the credit of the first building, and those en<a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>gaged on the subsequent enlargement, asking to be paid <em>fro rata </em>with them. The very foundation of'the lien given to the mechanic or material man is, that he trusts the building. What building ? That building which is then in the course of erection upon a certain plan, and with a certain design. It is to be a dwelling-house or a mill, a barn or a church. But if a man, having begun and nearly completed a dwelling-house, should then change his design, and determine to carry up the walls, and make a shot-tower of it, can it be said, in the eye of the mechanics’ lien law, that the shot-tower thus finished is the same building as that begun, and that the first and last mechanics are all to come in alike ? A principle leading to results which might prove so disastrous to the very class of men protected by this act, ought not to be easily admitted. Nor would it be less dangerous to others. The mortgagee in this case, when he advanced his money on the first mortgage, examined the ground. He saw a building nearly finished, which, when finished, would be a complete structure. He took the precaution to inquire, and satisfy himself that all the mechanics and material men who up to that time had been employed in that erection, werer fully paid. Even if the proprietor had then in his mind the idea of an enlargement, is the mortgagee to lose his security entirely by the commencement of extensive additions, the expense of which will swallow up the whole value of the original structure ? In the case before us, the cost of the engine and gearing alone, included in the change, was more than ifll,000, to say nothing of the engine-house and grinding shop. The true question then, is, was the whole establishment erected on substantially one plan and design from the commencement, or was the plan or design so materially changed during the progress of the work as to make the whole a different building from that which was or would have been erected had no such change taken place ? I use this language cautiously, to exclude the idea that any project of subsequent alteration, whether vague or certain, whether entertained at the commencement, or suggested during the progress of the building, and not embodied in the actual plan upon which it was commenced and carried on, could make any difference. If the change, whenever conceived or put in operation, involved the whole design and character of the structure; if the whole, when finished, was substantially a different building from the one which was at first commenced, then the existence of such a design ought not injuriously to affect the liens of the mechanics and others who trusted to the building according to the original plan.</p>

We have the fact that the change was a material one, altering the whole design, and that when complete, all together, both the original and the enlarged parts constituted one establishment. The enlargement would be worthless, comparatively at least, if it were separated from the main building, as much so as a kitchen separated from a dwelling. Would this case be different, for better or worse, at least so far as the principle is concerned, if this enlargement had been commenced ten years after the first building was finished, instead of a week before ? It is well settled that when the whole design and character of an old building are changed by alteration and improvements, it is to be considered a new erection, within the Acts of Assembly, relating to mechanics’ liens. The claims of the mechanics and material men relate to the commencement of the alterations, and are subject to all prior liens, which had fastened upon the land before that period.</p>
    <p id="b126-6" data-blocks='[["BL_126.5",126,[317,1129,1162,687]]]'>“ It is, perhaps, not easy to extract any clear rule of determination from the decided cases, as to what alteration of an old building shall constitute a new erection within the provisions of the statutes. It cannot be considered as definitely settled as yet, whether the question is one of law or fact. We have heretofore decided, and as yet adhere to that decision, that when the facts are ascertained or undisputed, it is for the court to determine what does or does not constitute new buildings. If it be a question of fact for a jury, then there may be different verdicts in regard to the same building by different juries, and some mechanics have their claims allowed and others rejected, which would be the most palpable injustice. It is no more an indefinite question than are the questions of reasonable notice and probable cause which have been finally resolved into questions of law for the sake of that certainty and uniformity which are always to be sought after in the administration of justice.</p>

It may be safely conceded that unimportant alterations in the plan, such as the height or the number of the stories, the arrangement and finish of the different rooms, or even the addition of one or more out-houses, not materially altering its character, would not affect the rights of subsequent claimants. But it cannot be meant that there must be a total change of purpose, as from a <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>Store to a dwelling. The cases of Driesbach <em>v. </em>Keller, and Armstrong <em>v. </em>Ware, show that it is not essential: In Driesbach <em>v. </em>Keller, 2 <em>Barr </em>79, there was an old one-story dwelling, the roof was taken off, it was raised one story; a new two-story house was built alongside of it, and the whole put under a new roof. ‘ Repairs,’ said Judge Sergeant, ‘may be slight, or in some cases they may be very considerable, and carried to such an extent as in fact to amount to the erection of a new building, different in its capacities and character from the old one. In extreme eases there can be no difficulty in determining in which class to rank it, either as merely repairing or restoring an old building to its original state, or as in effect, constituting another building. Even a slight addition, manifestly subservient to the original edifice, might, perhaps, be merely a repair. But a substantial addition of material parts, a rebuilding upon another and larger scale, constitutes a new building, even though some portions of the old are perceived and incorporated in the new.’ Here was a dwelling-house, which, after the alteration, still continued to be a dwelling-house: Armstrong <em>v. </em>Ware, 8 <em>Harris </em>519, was the case of a church which was enlarged, but still continued to be a church. The intermediate case of Landis’s Appeal, 10 <em>Barr </em>379, it may be difficult to distinguish upon the facts from Driesbach <em>v. </em>Keller, yet the court do attempt to distinguish it, and do not profess to overrule that case. It is clear that it is the extent and character of the alteration, and not the mere change of the purpose of the building, which ought to make the difference. There are, doubtless, cases in which it would be hard to say on which side of the dividing line they are to be placed. The mere change of a common dwelling into a store would not be as material an alteration as that of an ordinary single house into a large costly dwelling, with a double front and extensive back buildings. A man builds a small weaver’s shop to weave by hand-looms. He enlarges it to ten times its original size, and introduces power-looms. He may perhaps do so without disturbing a single brick or rafter of the old structure. It was a <em>factory </em>at first, it is still nothing but a <em>factory, </em>yet <em>the design of its character, </em>to use Judge Kennedy’s phrase, has been as materially, nay, more materially changed than if it had been converted into a store or dwelling. The cost of the alteration in its proportion to the whole, might be small in the latter case, in the former it might be so great as to render the cost of the original structure itself but a small proportion to the whole.</p>

It would give priority to and serve the claims of the mechanics for work done on the first building, if there had been any such remaining unsatisfied. It gives priority to and secures the mortgage executed and put on record before the alteration was begun on the ground. As to the subsequent <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>mortgages and incumbrances, they have no equity against tbe intervening lien claimants, the jury upon one of the issues submitted to them, having found that the improvements were commenced on the ground before October 1st, 1853. When these securities attached there was an enlargement of a very considerable nature actually in progress on the premises. They were bound to take notice of it and of its character. The same notice they would be obliged to submit to in the case of such an alteration of an old building as would constitute a new erection. The liens for claims for work done and materials furnished relate to the commencement of the alterations, not by the formation of the plan in the mind of the owner, not by the making of. the contracts for the work, but by the work itself on the ground, open, manifest, and, therefore, notice to all the world.</p>

    <p id="b129-8" data-blocks='[["BL_129.11",129,[513,1055,813,43]]]'>Decree affirmed at the costs of the appellants.</p>
