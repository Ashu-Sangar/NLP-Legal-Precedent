The principle of law, <a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>as I state it, is, that a sale for cash, paid as soon as the amount is sufficiently ascertained to pass the right of property and render payment possible and obligatory, does not vest any right in the vendor, which can be attached by his creditors.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b521-6" data-blocks='[["BL_521.6",521,[168,586,1165,889]]]'>“ The evidence in this case would seem to show (although that is a question for the jury) that the quantity and value of the goods were not determined, nor the price fixed until the day on which the attachment was served. If so, the jury must decide whether payment was made on that day, and whether what took place on that day was a payment. If the sum placed in the hands of Sweeney, Rittenhouse &amp; Co., was money reserved or kept hack out of the sale; if, in short, it was still the money of the purchasers, to be paid thereafter to the vendors, then it was attachable, and the jury should find for the plaintiffs. If, on the other hand, it was paid to Sweeney, Rittenhouse &amp; Co., as the money and for the account of the vendors in extinguishment of the debt due by the purchasers, then it would not be bound by this attachment. One test on this point is, whether, if Sweeney, Rittenhouse &amp; Co. had failed, or made default in paying the money, suit could have been brought by the defendant against the garnishees on the contract between them and the defendants, for the purpose of recovering the amount thus deposited. Unless such a suit could have been maintained, the jury cannot consistently find that the money continued to be due or could be made the subject of an attachment.”</p>
