The plaintiff was the original architect, who contracted to build a house for one Gihon, and, as it is not uncommon, stipulated in his contract that the right to receive compensation for the party-wall, when it should accrue, should belong to him. If then the wall had been used, Bye would have been compelled to sue in the name <a id="p376" href="#p376" data-label="376" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*376</a>of Gihon, the legal owner of the claim; Bye having an equity. Gihon sold to Roberts, and gave him distinct notice of Bye’s equity. Roberts was now the legal owner under the Act of 1849, but .subject to Bye’s equity. The notice affected him with the trust; he stepped into Gihon’s shoes, and stood in the same privity with Bye that Gihon did. If, during Roberts’ ownership, the wall had been used, the suit must have been in Roberts’ name to Bye’s use. Roberts was a trustee for Bye. But when Roberts sold to Fallon, without notice, the right of action vested absolutely in Fallon, clear of Bye’s equity. If the walls were afterwards used, Fallon would be entitled to recover for such use, and the money would be his; Bye would have no claim to it. On the sale of the house, the contingent right of compensation may or may not have been a distinct subject of calculation in the consideration: it matters not, if it was or not. It is for the jury to say how much it was worth; whatever it was, when Roberts received the value, it was Bye’s money, and Bye could at once sustain an action for money had and received to his use. If not, Bye has been deprived of a clear right, and is without a remedy. If he waits till the wall is used, he clearly has no right of action against the second builder. Fallon, who bought without notice, is the person entitled to that. Must he wait until then before he can sue Roberts ?</p>

It is therefore a right appurtenant to land, and may properly be called an easement or servitude. In Philadelphia, this relation between adjoiners is regulated by statute. He that first builds on his line must erect the wall at his own expense, and it is then, as one whole wall, an essential part of his house, and is therefore real estate. Yet half of it rests on his neighbour’s land, which is charged with a servitude for this purpose.</p>
    <p id="b377-8" data-blocks='[["BL_377.12",377,[188,1275,1165,509]]]'>The owner of the house has no charge against anybody for the half thus built on his neighbour’s land; but the wall is his own, and the neighbour cannot use it without paying for so much' of it as he intends to use; and, on paying, he may use it, and then the wall becomes a common wall, and each lot becomes appurtenant to the other so far as needed for its support. The owner of the wall has, therefore, a contingent claim against the adjoining lot-owner that he shall pay for his share of the wall before using it, though it is half on his own ground. The price to be paid is, consequently, a fixed lien on the lot, to be enforced by restraining the full use of it until the wall is paid for: 8 <em>S. </em>&amp; R. 59; <em>Smith's Ex. Int. </em>§ 74.</p>

But the law, by a somewhat anomalous yet practical accommodation, allows the mechanic who builds the wall to make an agreement to look to the adjoiner for the half value of it. He, therefore, retains a lien on the land for so much. But still the lien is an incident of the wall, and the wall is part of the house; and, therefore, to all appearance, the lien belongs to the owner of the house, and passes on a sale of the house, or may be bought from the owner by the adjoiner, so as to extinquish the builder’s lien. The owner may, therefore, be called, according to the analogies of the law, a trustee of the lien for the builder; and a purchaser from him, without legal notice, will take the title to the wall, discharged from the builder’s claim. A purchaser, with notice, according to the same analogies, becomes trustee instead of the original owner. If the trustee sells the house, without <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>reserving the builder’s lien, he sells the builder’s right, and must account to him for its value.</p>
    <p id="b378-6" data-blocks='[["BL_378.6",378,[308,494,1162,464]]]'>It seems to us that the action of <em>assumpsit </em>is a very proper remedy for such a case, and we do not see that the count for money had and received was inappropriate to the facts of this case. The verdict of the jury seems to be about equal to the half value of the wall, though it was riot yet used by the adjoiner, and this seems unjust; yet we do not see that any instructions were prayed for or given in the court below on this subject, and1 we must presume that the plaintiff’s right was valued with reference to the contingency on which it depended. If the wall was likely to be used the next season, he might get nearly its full value.</p>
