D. 1846, and if falsely recited, it was competent for the plaintiff to show from the records of the Patent Office that no such patent had ever been issued to Wheeler.

Grant that Beach was proved to have been the first inventor, and that this fact invalidated Wheeler’s patent, yet when the Boston suit was commenced was there not a deceptive appearance of guilt, arising from circumstances misunderstood so far as to produce belief? There was but one way of answering this question negatively, and that was by going further, and showing not only that Beach was the prior inventor, but that Wheeler <em>Jcneiv </em>him to be so. Had that been shown, the malicious motive of Wheeler’s suit would have discovered itself at once, for he was bound to know that the first inventor had the best right to the patent, and that a patent obtained by <em>Mm </em>for an invention known to be another’s, was void— could not be the subject of infringement — and gave him no right of action whatever. Nay, if he knew that Beach was the original inventor, he was bound to know that he had himself practiced a fraud on the government, and so far from having any right of action against Beach, was liable to heavy penalties for'the wrong he had done.</p>
