The horses were received by the agents of the company, who assisted in shipping them, designating the cars, and the manner in which they were to be secured. There were no stalls or compartments in the cars; and the plaintiff’s seven horses, with six others belonging to another person, were placed in the same car.</p>

During this period, the conductors, engineers, firemen, and brakesmen of the company were changed three times, but the drovers were compelled to ride night and day under their horses’ feet, which is proved to be dangerous, or outside on the bumpers, in the midst of inclement February weather.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b243-13" data-blocks='[["BL_243.14",243,[214,1885,1164,472]]]'>The train left Horst’s Station, between nine and ten o’clock in the evening. One Silverthorn, a drover, not connected with the plaintiff, and who had charge of a load of cattle in an uncovered car, tried here to obtain some temporary protection from the cold, by getting in a covered horse-car. As he was about getting in, he slipped and fell, and when he recovered himself the train was beginning to move. One of the brakesmen called to him, from his bumper, to get up there by the step, and assisted him in doing so. He stood for a few moments, then suddenly slipped and fell under the wheels. The accident killed Silverthorn, threw the train off the track, and killed or injured all the plaintiff’s horses.</p>

If the jury should find the contract as alleged by the defendants, it is the duty of the court to construe it. The carrier is bound, notwithstanding such a contract, to use ordinary diligence, such as a man of common prudence ordinarily employs in his own concerns — and if he fail in this, and loss ensue therefrom, he is liable in damages. This company, holding itself out as a common carrier, and professing to have a railway, cars, and facilities for the transportation of live stock, were bound, even after the plaintiff had signed the release, by the rule of ordinary diligence and care. The effect of the contract was to take away the insurance against <em>all </em>risks — to abridge their common law liabilities — but not to excuse them for the want of ordinary care in the execution of the duty voluntarily assumed. If, therefore, the jury should find from the evidence, that the injury complained of by the plaintiff resulted from a want of this measure of care on the part of the company, they should assess his damages, notwithstanding the terms of the release signed by him.</p>

If they did not, and Silverthorn was precipitated under the cars by reason of the company’s neglect in this point, whereby the cars were thrown from the track, the injury is to be imputed not to the act of Grod, but to the culpable negligence of the company.</p>
