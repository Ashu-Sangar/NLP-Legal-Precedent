If they desire to be incorporated, the law makes it essential that they shall “specify the objects” for which they have associated; and before this court can consent to approve of their incorporation, we must have their objects so far defined that we can feel assured that they are such as can fairly be presumed to fall within the meaning of the law giving us this jurisdiction.</p>
    <p id="b150-14" data-blocks='[["BL_150.15",150,[279,1752,1160,215]]]'>In the preamble of this charter, the purpose is declared to be “ the promotion of literature and the cultivation of friendly feelings,” and in Art. 1, it is declared to be “ the establishment of a fund necessary for an accumulation of <em>works </em>and other matters productive of literary attainments.” ■</p>

If we grant a charter to an association “for the cultivation of friendly feelings,” and “for an accumulation of works,” and these vague terms are left to be interpreted according to the principles of any associates who may choose to use them, they may include free-love societies, and the <em>works </em>spoken of may be works of art such as are forbidden by law and good morals. We <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>do not know whether this society is a library, or art union, or musical, or debating, or theatrical, or dancing society.</p>
