      <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>“ A train of decisions from the date of Perrin <em>v. </em>Blake to the present time, embracing a period of nearly a hundred years, satisfies my mind that the devisee took an estate tail. It is unnecessary to enumerate these decisions. They establish, it would seem to me, beyond controversy, principles which, when applied to the case before us, must rule it as I have indicated.</p>
    <p id="b163-6" data-blocks='[["BL_163.5",163,[203,695,1166,209]]]'>“In Clark <em>v. </em>Baker, 3 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>470, Chief Justice Tilghman says: ‘ I take it to be established, that the words <em>without leaving </em>issue, applied to real property, are to be understood issue indefinitely, unless there be some other words showing an intent to restrict them to the time of the death of the first taker.’</p>

    <p id="b163-8" data-blocks='[["BL_163.7",163,[202,1345,1164,776]]]'>“ In Eichelberger <em>v. </em>Barnitz, the same learned judge remarks: £ Questions as to the effect of words in wills similar to those used in the present one, in creating an estate tail in the first taker, or an estate in fee with an executory devise over, have been so frequent, that their construction must be considered as settled by authorities, which we are not at liberty to subvert, even if we could flatter ourselves with the idea that we could delineate a more perfect system on this refined subject, than that which the existing law establishes. The principle has now become a settled rule of property, in relation to lands, that if a devise .be made to one in fee, and if he die without issue — or on failure of issue — or for want of issue — or without leaving issue, then over to another in fee, the estate of the first taker is a fee-tail, which, if he have issue, passes to them, <em>ad infinitum, </em>by descent, as tenants in tail. The estate vests in the first taker fully, and to all intents and purposes as a fee tail, and any devise over after the failure of such, must, of course, be after an indefinite failure of issue, and bad as an executory devise.’</p>
    <p id="b163-9" data-blocks='[["BL_163.8",163,[198,2121,1160,343]],["BL_164.1",164,[349,432,1161,132]]]'>“ In the case of Middleswarth <em>v. </em>Collins, tried in the District Court of Allegheny county, before the present chief justice of the Supreme Court of the state, it was declared that£ A devise to A., or to A. for life, or to A. and his heirs, with a subsequent clause devising over, on A. dying without leaving issue, has always and invariably been construed as, of itself, creating an estate tail. A devise over on A. dying without leaving issue, has, without almost an exception, been construed as imputing an indefinite failure of <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>issue, unless there is something in the character of the devise over, that demands an implication of a failure of issue within a definite period.’</p>
    <p id="b164-6" data-blocks='[["BL_164.5",164,[340,563,1166,603]]]'>“It must be remarked, however, that the fundamental maxim upon which the construction of every devise depends, is that the intention of the testator shall always be observed, wherever it is fully made known, and is consistent with the established rules of law. Authorities need not be invoked to sustain this well settled principle. But the intention must not be guessed at or conjectured ; it must be found in the words of the will; and where the testator makes use of words which have already received a legal construction, they will receive such construction, unless it is plainly shown they were intended to be used in another sense. 4 It is a general rule,’ observes Vice-Chancellor Plumee, 4 with regard to the construction of wills, that the testator’s meaning is to be collected from the will itself; taking in aid the general rules of construction established by decisions,’</p>
    <p id="b164-7" data-blocks='[["BL_164.6",164,[329,1165,1168,990]]]'>44 In examining the authorities in relation to the devise in question, one cannot fail to notice what would appear to be conflicting decisions upon the point to be determined. ÍTor are these of recent origin. Without going further back than Perrin <em>v. </em>Blake, we there find a diversity of opinion between the King’s Bench and the Exchequer Chamber: the former determining that the intention being apparent must govern the case, and the latter, reversing the judgment, on the ground that no such plain and manifest intent appeared, as could control the legal operation of the words, and at the same time be consistent with the fundamental rules of law. From that period down to the present time, conflicting opinions may be found, which frequently puzzle the courts, in the determination of questions arising from devises of the kind here given. They are noticed by Judge Duncan, in Clark <em>v. </em>Baker, as 4 decisions apparently clashing;’ by Judge Huston, in Caskey <em>v. </em>Brewer, as 4 scattered cases which look like exceptions and by the present Chief Justice in Middleswarth <em>v. </em>Collins, as 4 decisions entirely incompatible.’ It may be asserted with truth, however, that they fix no settled construction; they establish no rule of property in relation to lands, and apply as authority only to cases 4 when the time at which the devise over is to take effect, is expressly or impliedly limited to a particular period, within a life or lives in being, and twenty-one years after.’</p>
    <p id="b164-8" data-blocks='[["BL_164.7",164,[329,2153,1156,303]],["BL_165.1",165,[209,423,1159,304]]]'>44 This diversity of opinion in the decisions of courts arises not from any unsettled state of the law on the subject, but from the interpretation given to the expressions of testators. In most cases wherein questions of this kind arise, devisors have not contemplated every possible combination of events which might occur after their deaths, and have not provided precisely for them. The duty of a judge, under such circumstances, is often difficult, as <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>conflicting intents frequently occur; and to give effect to what may be esteemed the leading intent, legal principles may sometimes be overlooked, technical words cast aside, without any clear indication that they were not used in their technical sense, and established rules of law disregarded. A question between a definite and an indefinite failure of issue, seems to be one most likely to produce diversity of opinion.</p>
    <p id="b165-6" data-blocks='[["BL_165.5",165,[208,725,1162,1204]]]'>“ Formerly, if not at the present, the question was, whether the testator had so explained his intention as to control technical expressions; and such seems to have been the settled opinion of the profession so late as the decision of Lapsley <em>v. </em>Lapsley, 9 <em>Barr </em>130, where a devise ‘ among sons equally, they paying certain legacies, and if any of them die without issue, their share shall be divided between the surviving brothers,’ was held in the original devise to be a fee reduced to an estate tail, with a remainder in fee, by force of the devise over on the death of the devisees without issue. In the next book of reports, however, a different rule would appear to have prevailed, and the rule of law which has been considered so fully settled, evidently disregarded. I will not attempt to account for the decision of the court in the case of Johnson <em>v. </em>Currin, 10 <em>Barr </em>498. With the highest regard for the memory of the learned judge who pronounced the decision, I may be allowed to remark, that he laboured under a misapprehension when he declared that ‘the ease of Perrin <em>v. </em>Blake was the strongest in which it was ruled that the manifest intent of the testator will control the legal and technical operation of the word heirs.’ That case was finally determined, eight judges to four, to be an estate tail. Without animadverting upon the doctrine laid down in the case of Johnson <em>v. </em>Currin, I will observe, in the language of an eminent judge, that the case is ‘ put entirely upon the intent of the testator without giving proper weight to the principle that consistency with the rules of law, is always an element in that canon of construction; and that there are rules of law <em>for arriving </em>at the intent, and some that <em>control </em>and <em>frustrate </em>the most manifest intent.’</p>
    <p id="b165-7" data-blocks='[["BL_165.6",165,[212,1929,1157,431]]]'>“ In the case under consideration, the testator devises to his son Jonas Chamberlain, all his real and personal property, to hold to him, his heirs and assigns for ever; and, in a subsequent clause, he adds: ‘ but if my said son, Jonas Chamberlain, should depart this life without leaving lawful issue,’ &amp;c., &amp;c., then over. If the word ‘ issue’ conveys the same idea as the words ‘ heirs of the body’ — and such is its legal signification — then the devise to Jonas is, by the established rule of law, an estate tail. Are there any other, words in the will showing a <em>manifest intent </em>in the testator to be understood as meaning a definite failure of issue ?</p>
    <p id="b165-8" data-blocks='[["BL_165.7",165,[214,2359,1155,87]],["BL_166.1",166,[313,413,1160,720]]]'>“ It must be admitted, that words which limit the time at which the devise over is to take effect to a particular period, within a <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>life or lives in being, and twenty-one years after, would defeat the legal estate before noticed, and would make the devise over an executory devise. It would be limiting a fee upon a fee. I can see no such intent in the testator. In that event, should the son die without leaving issue, or until issue was born, he would hold a life estate merely, while at the same time he would be required to pay over to the nephews and nieces of the testator the legacies charged upon the land, and made payable within one year after the death of the devisor. This could not have been intended. The son must be considered as the primary object of the testator’s bounty, yet, with the construction put upon it by the defendant, an event might occur where the devisee would receive but the rents and profits for a year, and the nephews and nieces would take the whole estate, after having received legacies to the amount of $8600. On a consideration of the whole matter, my opinion is, that Jonas Chamberlain took an estate tail under the will of his father.</p>
