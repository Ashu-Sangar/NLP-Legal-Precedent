      <em>“ </em>Wherever the owner of a wharf upon the river Delaware is desirous to extend such wharf into the tide-way of the river, and makes application for that purpose to the Board of Wardens of the port of Philadelphia, under the provisions of the Act of February 7th 1818, the said Board of Wardens are authorized to determine two questions : 1st. Whether the plan of the intended wharf may be lawfully executed. 2d. Whether such wharf will improperly encroach on, or injure the ehantiel or harbour. If satisfied upon these points, the law says they shall give their license for erecting or extending such wharf. It was not the intention of the act referred to, to invest the Board of Wardens with jurisdiction to inquire as to the relative rights of adjoining or distant wharf-owners, or to ascertain and determine in what manner, and to what extent the erection of a wharf, upon the plan submitted by one person, might affect the value of the property of others in the neighbourhood. These questions were left for the consideration of other and more appropriate tribunals.</p>

If incommoded by the second extension, he should have taken thought of that at first and allowed less wharf and more dock room. On an application to the wardens for a license, under the Act of 1818, the question is one of public interest, not of private right. For the redress of an injury done to the first builder by the second, the courts of law are open. The Board of Wardens is a tribunal <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>instituted for the determination, of questions affecting the public. If they refuse an applicant a license, he may appeal; for to him the injury is reparable only in this way. It certainly never could have been the intention either of the Act of 1851, or that of 1854, to give the right of appeal, at different times, to every owner of property on the same river, and to every one having the right to use it as a highway; for then a case would occupy a lifetime. There is no analogy of the law which, on principle, gives to a neighbouring owner such an appeal; for he is not on the record of the wardens, and not a party to their proceedings. In reason, he is not entitled, for he has no interest in that which belongs to the public. More than all, no statute gives him the right.</p>
