Was it paid in'advance, to apply upon the contract, as payment for the peaches when delivered? If it was, then there was no failure on the part of the plaintiff, as the peaches delivered up to Saturday, the 13th of August, amounted to less than $500, and the next payment would not fall due until the 19th of August. But if the $500 were to remain as security until the end of the delivery of the peaches, then the question arises, whether the failure to pay on Saturday, the 12th, authorized the defendant to rescind the contract ? Upon this point the jury are instructed — That where a contract is made to deliver perishable articles from day to day, at a particular place, to be paid for at the place of delivery at the end of each week; upon failure by the purchaser to make the payment at the time agreed upon, the seller is not bound to deliver any more until payment is made or offered to be made; and, if this payment or offer is delayed beyond a reasonable time, taking into view the nature of the article, the seller may rescind the contract. What would be a reasonable time, would ordinarily be a question of fact for the jury, but the time may be so long as to justify the conclusion as matter of law, that it was unreasonable, or it might be so short, that in law the delay would not be unreasonable; and to apply the principle to the case in hand, the jury are further instructed, that if they find from the evidence that the plaintiffs were not present on Saturday, the 12th, to make the payment for the peaches delivered up to that day inclusive, that the defendant delivered peaches under the contract on Monday, the 14fch, and that on Tuesday, the 15th, the plaintiff was ready and willing to perform the contract on his part, and did offer to perform, by paying for all the peaches delivered up to Saturday, the 12th, inclusive, and to leave the $500 to remain, as originally agreed upon, as security, and the defendant refused to deliver the peaches under the contract — he is responsible for the damages sustained by the plaintiffs in consequence of the defendant’s non-compliance with the contract.</p>

If the buyer does not pay according to contract, the seller is not bound to keep the peaches for him at the risk of their rotting, nor to deliver them at the risk of not being paid, any more than the buyer would be bound to accept the delivery weekly instead of daily. Neither party has any time to be wasted by the unpunctuality of the other; and neither is required to endure the anxiety of having his summer’s success dependant on one who is not careful of his engagement. The success of both depends upon their promptness in the performance of present duty. The seller could not expect the buyer to be running down to the country to look after his peaches, nor the buyer that the seller should be running up to Philadelphia after his money.

We think they were too late. To relieve them would be to change their contract without cause, which we cannot do. If the plaintiffs came a few days afterwards, and offered proper terms to secure their future performance and these were rejected, this might be a defence against a suit for damages for their breach, but it could not restore the contract.</p>

The plaintiffs cannot get over this without presenting their receipt, and the necessary witness to prove it declares that the $500 were to stand as security. All the probabilities of the case, and all the other evidence confirm it. The plaintiff’s case fails therefore at the very outset, because he cannot prove his own performance according to the contract.
