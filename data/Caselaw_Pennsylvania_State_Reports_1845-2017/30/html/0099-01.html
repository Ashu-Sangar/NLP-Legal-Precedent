On the other hand eleven, to wit: Frederick K. Smith, John H. Kaull, George Nace, Wm. Gorgas, John Haag, John Hartranft, Jesse Hildebitle, Jacob Kraft, Jacob C. Moyer, Elias Barndt (a son-in-law), and Philip Nace, Jr. (son of plaintiff), testify with more or less directness, positiveness, and circumstantiality, to his sanity and competency to do the act in question. After making every allowance and abatement on account of the different degrees of knowledge and opportunities for acquiring it on the part of the witnesses on both sides, I think the balance still x'emains as originally inclined. The testimony of his son Philip, with whom he lived before, at the time of, and after the conveyance, and. of his hired man John Haag, is entitled to special consideration, on account of their superior and constant opportunities of observing the state of his mind and conduct. Nor is the testimony on this point of Esquire Smith, corroborated strongly as it is by that of Philip Nace, Jr., Jacob Kraft and others, as to the circumstances of his conduct immediately preceding and at the time of the conveyance, of less importance. The attempted impeachment of Squire Smith, by the testimony of Krieble and Weishley as to the declaration of the former on the 8th of May, I do not think entitled to much consideration. 1st. It is more likely that these witnesses misapprehended Squire Smith’s remark, as stated by himself, than that tlie latter should have made a statement so utterly at variance not only with his sworn testimony, and after, too, he had been subpoenaed to give that very testimony, but with all his previous conduct and his known and acknowledged character as an upright magistrate and a man of probity. 2d. These witnesses do not agree as to Squire Smith’s words, and the same witness varies in each repetition of his statement. Such looseness of recollection may well co-exist with an original misunderstanding. Sd. The testimony of Squire Smith, on the stand under oath, whatever he may have said at any other time, is fully corroborated in every leading and important fact stated, by Messrs. Ki-aft, Philip Nace, Jr., Brandt, and others, who are"unimpeached, and must, therefore, be taken as that of a truthful witness; especially as no corrupt motive, on his part, to falsify, is shown or even suggested. I readily concede, on the other hand, that great respect is due to the knowledge and opinions, on this point, of the daughter and two sons, who have testified against the capacity of their father. Were it necessary, it might be worth while to consider how far the expectation of favour at his hands, in the final disposition of his estate, should he succeed by their aid in getting it again into his own control, may have insensibly influenced their opinions; and such an influence might well be set off against any interest which the son and son-in-law, who testify on the other side, have in upholding this deed; which, after all, only give them such an interest as would be tlxeirs in case of intestacy. It might be <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>profitable, too, to inquire how it was that Tobias Nace, who now alleges his father’s incapacity, was, according to his own testimony, found bargaining with him for the purchase of a portion of his real estate at the very time he now alleges this incapacity to have existed. Also, how it happened that on neither of the two Saturdays, when the old man had gathered his children around him for the very purpose of effecting this arrangement, and when the family was all assembled, and when some of those present were averse to the proposed arrangement, that no one, not even Tobias or Michael, then suggested their father’s incapacity to the scrivener, or among themselves, or to anybody.</p>

It seems to me, unless we totally reject the evidence of Philip Nace, Kaull, Smith, and Kraft, that this is out of the question. On the contrary, uncommon pains would seem to have been taken that he should fully understand what he was about to do, and its effects; and more than ordinary time for deliberation afforded. As early as the spring preceding, we find him broaching the same plan to Mr. Kaull, who then suggested to him that he had better (to use his own expression) <em>‘ </em>keep the reins in his own hands.’ The old man, however, persisted, and gave his reasons, which, whether conclusive ot not to the wisdom of the course contemplated, certainly furnished no evidence either of insanity or unfair practice. And it is to be remembered that there is no evidence to show, at that time, any of his sons or sons-in-law had been trying to persuade him to part with his property, or even spoken on the subject. The idea was his own, and the spontaneous product of his own mind; nor, however ill-advised the step, is it one of so uncommon a character or unusual occurrence as to require us, without proof, to presume fraud, circumvention, or unfair practice upon his mind. Whether we may think it wise or unwise for a man to take off his clothes before he is ready to go to bed, we know of many instances in which men, feeling the approach of age with its infirmities, finding memory <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>failing, or physical strength declining, and the cares of business a burthen, have made over their property to their children — reserving a support, and relying on their gratitude and filial duty and affection that such support will be fairly rendered. This forms a good consideration for a conveyance; nor does the subsequent failure of duty on the part of the child, form a ground upon which to avoid the deed, but the grantor must pursue his remedy on his contract or covenants.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b104-6" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[291,752,1157,1116]]]'>“In September following, we find him calling on Squire Smith, to procure his services as scrivener to carry out this idea. Owing to sickness in Smith’s family, the matter was postponed; and after a week or two the old man calls again, according to appointment, and arranges for a meeting of the family, together with the scrivener, on the following Saturday. Most of them assemble, and they wait from 1 o’clock until 8 for Tobias, who not coming, the matter is again postponed, and another meeting arranged for the following Saturday. In the meantime, the old man had furnished Smith with his instructions, who took a memorandum of them. On the day of final meeting, Smith testifies that he advised against the measure in the presence of the old man and his children, and afterwards took the old man aside and endeavoured to dissuade him from it — representing the ill effects that might ensue, and referring to difficulties that had arisen in a similar case. The old gentleman, however, was firm in his purpose. The members of the family, too, said he was forgetful, and the arrangement had best be made as he wanted it; and it was made. The old man produced his deeds, sat by the scrivener, and gave him directions. The original memorandum was read over and explained; the deed was read, part by part, as it progressed, and afterwards entire when completed; and its contents, nature, and effect, elaborately explained. This was done again and again, in English and in German. The deed was then executed ; appraisers were sent for; the old man produced his papers, notes, bonds, &amp;e., and an inventory was made.</p>

There was nothing hurried — nothing precipitated: for weeks intervened between the first agitation and the final completion of the matter. The family all notified and assembled, and a postponement of a week in consequence of the absence of the very member of it who now is chiefly relied on to impeach this deed; and the scrivener, the agent by whom this act of fraud on the old man was to have been consummated, and who, I suppose, will not be suspected of complicity, selected, not by the eoncocters, but by the intended victim of the fraud. Surely never was meditated fraud more awkwardly <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>concocted. The general rule is, that a party executing a deed is presumed to know its contents; and where there are no suspicious circumstances to influence it, the rule is that the burthen of proof is on him who seeks to impeach a legal instrument. Here, however, the defendants, if the testimony is believed, have on their part strongly fortified the presumption.</p>

If seems to me that the allegation of the bill, that the plaintiff was fraudulently circumvented into signing this deed, in utter ignorance of its contents or effect, is fully disproved by the testimony. The very reason repeatedly given by him for desiring to make this arrangement, to wit, that then he would have no further trouble in taking care of his estate, disproves his present allegation, that he did not know, when he signed the deed, that its effect would be to take the management of his property out of his hands.</p>

Have we not wills on our own records now, in which an equal share and no more is given by trustees of undoubted capacity to their lunatic children, with no special provision in their favour save providing for the care of the fund in the hands of trustee? Suppose old Philip Nace were now dead, having made his will, giving this son only an equal share with his other children. Would any one be heard who sought to impeach his will on this ground ?

The attempt on his own life, some ten years before the deed, would indicate positive insanity, but the evidence proves abundantly his recovery from that condition. The witnesses differ very much in their estimate of his intellect, some of them thinking him competent to contract, and others incompetent, but the case presented is not one of mental derangement at the time the deed was executed, nor of absolute imbecility, but of weakness of intellect from old age, and trouble. He himself recites in his deed that from “ disadvantageous bargains and undertakings, considerable losses and indebtedness, and old age and feebleness, he has become so much troubled in mind as to be unable of attending to business,” which I presume may be safely assumed as a fair exhibition of his mental condition. Unable to attend to business, but not necessarily unable to make a valid conveyance to trustees for the benefit of himself and children, and yet so far impaired in mind as to be more easily imposed* upon, circumvented, and overcome by cunning and undue influence than if adverse circumstances had not reduced the natural vigour of his intellect.</p>

Still they are common, and this one is as well guarded as they usually are. It conveys to his chosen trustees his whole estate, real and personal, to convert into money — out of the proceeds to pay his debts, and carefully to preserve the residue by investments in real estate — to apply the interest to his maintenance and support for life, and after his death to divide all that remains among his nine children, share and share alike. He thought, and so declared in the deed, that this arrangement will “ spare me much care and trouble, and save me from further losses, and the destruction of my property.” An instrument founded in such reasons, and so much in accordance with family arrangements in Pennsylvania, though it may not be sanctioned by the highest prudence, cannot be considered so improvident as to prove either imbecility or imposition. His son Paul was <em>non compos </em>mentis, and it is thought a sign of the father’s imbecility that he did not provide specially for him. He probably thought Paul would be taken care of by <em>his </em>brothers as <em>he </em>had <em>been, </em>and that an equal share of the estate after his death would compensate for Paul’s support.

Wenholt characterizes the scene strongly. He says, the “ old man stood there hanging his head — the way they had the old man there was enough to make a sane man mad.” But he admits that he stood off twenty-five steps, and did not hear what was said, though he saw Boyer and Scholl standing before the old man, and making “great motions with their hands.” From Michael Nace we learn what was said at this interview: “Boyer and Scholl said to the old man that he should give his property out of his hands, and they would take it in hand, and loan out his money, and would not charge any commissions unless where money was standing out, and there was danger of its being lost; it would relieve him from trouble, live <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>easy, live around with his children or elsewhere, and they would pay him.
