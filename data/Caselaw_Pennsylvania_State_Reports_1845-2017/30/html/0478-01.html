Peter Miller was the heir at law of his uncle, and if the large devises in trust contained in his uncle’s will could be set aside, he would succeed to the bulk of the estate. He first agreed to divide his contingent interest with Wilhelm, and then they jointly agreed to compensate the professional services of the other two gentlemen, by giving them, in the event of success, one-fifth of the estate— leaving two-fifths of it for each of themselves. This was the posture of affairs when the agreement of 18th November 1850 was executed. As between themselves, each was considered entitled to a share, and they, no doubt, executed the agreement of November 1850 with that understanding.

The doctrine that, where there has been actual and positive fraud, there can be no such thing as a confirmation — that what was once a fraud will always be so— that a contract infected with this kind of fraud is not merely voidable but void — and that confirmation without a new consideration is mere <em>nudum pactum </em>— was very distinctly asserted in Duncan <em>v. </em>McCulloch, 4 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>487.</p>

The auditors cut him off, and without a decree of the court below in his favour he had no lot or part in the distribution. He sought and obtained the decree of the court below, and that is the very thing under consideration here. The question on this appeal is, whether the decree that Wilhelm obtained, restoring him to the place he claimed in the distribution, shall be confirmed or reversed, so that, although Miller took the appeal, it is Wilhelm’s title and nothing else that is in controversy. True, it relates only to the personalty, and the rents, issues, and profits of the realty of the decedent, but Wilhelm’s right to share in these depends on no executed act of the parties, but on the decree to be pronounced by this court.
