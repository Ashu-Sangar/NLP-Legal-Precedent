      <em>We </em>do not see how the assessment of damages could have been made in this case without it was under some exception, by contract or usage, to the general custom. It was decided in Koons <em>v. </em>Miller, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0271-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 271" data-case-ids="1854566" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0271-01">3 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>271</a>, that it was so universal a custom for a city merchant to charge a country merchant interest after six months, that it necessarily entered into the contract of sale. So in Watt &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Hoch, 1 <em>Casey </em>411. We believe the rule has become universal throughout the Commonwealth for all merchants to make the same charge, and we see no propriety in its being spoken of, or treated as peculiar to city merchants. If buyers do not intend to be bound by the usage, they must either pay, or contract against it. The law is settled. The plaintiffs below assessed his damages, and entered judgment as if the usage were to charge interest from date. In this they were wrong. It is only by usage, amounting to a custom of trade, that book accounts bear interest at all; and that usage fixes the period at six months after the date of sale of the bills or items constituting the account. The judgment for this reason, must be reversed, so that the assessment may be according to the custom. We perceive no other errors on the record.</p>
