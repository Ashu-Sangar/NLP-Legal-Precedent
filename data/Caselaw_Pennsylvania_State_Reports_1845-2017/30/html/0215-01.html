He gave judgments to the defendants to the amount of about $30,000, for large advances made by them, on lumber to be received from him.</p>

Having concluded to make a further advance to save the amount already owing to them, John McQuewan came up to McKean county in August 1854, and paidtoWright $4500. Wright then requested McQuewan to give him a credit at certain places in Olean, where he could trade to better advantage than in Smethport. This he did, with John Comstock and Stanley Martin; but, by special contract, that they should forward to defendants a copy of their account, at the end of every three months. Such accounts were furnished and paid.</p>

All experience justifies the rigour of the rule. Such, indeed, is the temptation to fraud and perjury in actions of this sort, that the legislature has at length given us the substance of the 4th section of the British statute of frauds and perjuries; and for the future, promises of this nature must be supported by written evidence.</p>

One of the McQuewans and one of the Hamlins were brought together, when their common debtor’s affairs were the subject of discussion, but there was no promise made at that time. The strongest evidence on which the plaintiffs relied, were the confessions of McQuewan made to Judge Sartwell, and to John K. Comstock. -And what did they amount to ? McQuewan said to the former witness, they had made arrangements with plaintiffs (the Hamlins) to furnish Mr. Wright with goods; and to the latter witness he wished to say the <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>same he had to them (Hamlins and other merchants), viz.: that he wished me to let Mr. Wright have what goods he might want, and at the expiration of every three months to send the amount to MeQuewans &amp; Douglas, at Pittsburgh, and they would pay it.</p>

And if the promise sued on was such as Comstock describes, it was the clear duty of the plaintiffs’ to furnish MeQuewans &amp; Douglas notice of the credits given to Wright. In this view of the evidence, the contract would be in the nature of a letter of credit, and it is a settled principle that a guarantor of future credit is entitled to notice from the party giving the credit, of his acceptance of the guaranty: Kay <em>v. </em>Allen, 9 <em>Barr </em>320.</p>
