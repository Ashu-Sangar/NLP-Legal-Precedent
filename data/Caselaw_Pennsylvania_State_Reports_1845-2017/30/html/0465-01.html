This is the written theory of these loans, as appears by the constitution and by-laws of this association, and of all others that have fallen under our notice.</p>
    <p id="b469-6" data-blocks='[["BL_469.6",469,[143,553,1159,855]]]'>Now, when we notice further, that these associations go on an opposite principle from all others, in this, that they are to be dissolved so soon as all the stock is paid up, which is usually in eight or nine years; then we are prepared to understand what is designed to be the actual practice. All stock paid in is intended to be loaned out to the stockholders at premiums and interest, and when the stock is all fully paid, it -and its profits are to be distributed among them. If a member has subscribed for $1000 of stock, and is not in arrears, he may become a borrower of $1000, on bidding the highest premium, and paying it in advance. The bond and mortgage which he gives as security, though made payable in a year, are really intended to stand until the period of dissolving the association, and are then to be regarded as paid by the mere payment of the interest and of the instalments of stock, and then the borrower will be entitled to his share of the profits of the association. In short, the loan is a mere advance of the stock to which the borrower expects to be entitled at the close of the concern; and when the arrears of stock and the interest on the advances are paid, the loan or advance is paid, and the borrower can claim only profits on the dissolution.</p>
    <p id="b469-7" data-blocks='[["BL_469.7",469,[144,1409,1158,420]]]'>In practice, these loans are sold at premiums of from thirty per cent, downwards, varying according to the number of years the association has yet to run. If the premium be only twenty-five per cent, on a loan of eight years, then, in that time, a real loan of $750 would produce $1480, which is over twelve per cent, a year. But a borrower on such terms must be expected to make default, and this may be in one year; and then, if the bond can be enforced, he will have to pay $1060 for $750, which is over forty-one per cent. If he should fail in six months, it would be worse still.</p>

This has led us to examine the subject, and we do not find any law authorizing them.</p>

But such institutions are not defined by the act, and not being then known among us, they had received no customary-definition. Their definition must, therefore, be drawn from the name given by the legislature, and their constitution must accord with the defined objects. “Building Association:” this is descriptive of their objects, and it does not authorize the incorporation of citizens as a means of dealing in money, in disregard of the usury laws. If it does, banks and saving funds for loaning money at legal interest are ridiculous institutions, in a mere financial aspect. The usurers of the land may form a thousand building associations to-morrow, and admit needy borrowers as members, and then, by means of premiums, lend them money at any given rate of interest.</p>

Such cannot be the institutions intended to be exempted from the taint of usury by the Act of 1855. In what kind of cases it is, that the legislature expects the courts to indulge one class of citizens in unlimited usury, and to enforce their grinding bargains, while all other citizens are to be punished by us for the same acts, and kept within the bounds of humane principles, we do not know, and the Act of 1855 does not inform us. Presuming that all are equal before the law, we must administer it equally to all who do not clearly show their special exemption, shadowed by no doubts in its interpretation.</p>

True, in the second article of its constitution, it declares its objects to be to erect buildings; but this is mere sham, for all the rest of its constitution and by-laws shows most distinctly that its only purpose is to loan out its money. This is a new device, and may require of the courts new or modified remedies to reach all the cases that will arise under it. We have begun of late to suspect that, by want of care, abuses were creeping in under the laws authorizing incorporations, and have begun to be extremely cautious in certifying charters. We advise other courts to do likewise, and we advise those interested in them to be sure that their objects and all their conditions are lawful.</p>

All stock payments are, therefore, so far as they go, a compliance with the terms involved in the transaction. The written terms are usurious, and must be set aside, except so far as necessary to enforce the lawful duty. When future cases arise, we must deal with them as wisely as we can, having regard to the many interests involved in the general question.</p>
