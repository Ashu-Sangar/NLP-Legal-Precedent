The evidence is, that the shipment of the 13th arrived at Port Jervis on the 17th. The plaintiffs received the goods delivered to the company on the 15th, and they are not in controversy. On the 17th, when the goods arrived at Port Jervis, the plaintiffs had a team there in readiness, and took away what they could load upon it of the goods. A few articles were left that they could .not take, and were placed in the depot or warehouse of the company. The teamster signed a receipt for nearly all of the goods, but swears that he signed it without reading it, and that it includes items that he did not receive. On the night of the 18th, the depot took fire and burned down, consuming the entire contents. The articles left in the warehouse or depot, belonging to the plaintiffs, were burned. The company had received the freight upon them. The defendants allege that the fire was accidental, and there is no evidence to the contrary.

Undoubtedly, if the storing the goods for a reasonable time, without charge, be a mere accessory of the contract for transportation, as was the case in Clarke <em>v. </em>Needles, the liability of the common carrier, as such, attaches and continues until the contract is fully performed, and such is Judge Story’s doctrine in his Law of Bailments, § 536; but these authorities do <em>not tend </em>to prove that a transportation company, who provide a storehouse for the accommodation of their customers, cannot maintain the double character of common carriers and warehousemen, nor that the one branch of business is so essentially an incident of the other as to be inseparable. Nor is such the law. On the contrary, Mr. Angelí, in his excellent work on Common Carriers, § 302, tells us, if a common carrier, from A. to B., receives goods to be carried from A. to B., and by the known usage and course of business, the goods are to be deposited in the carrier’s warehouse at B., the responsibility, as common carriers, is limited to the arrival of the goods at B., when he holds them, not as common carrier, but as a mere warehouseman. The keeping of the goods in the warehouse, in such cases, as was observed by Buller, J., in Garside <em>v. </em>Trent &amp; Mersey Nav. Co., 4 <em>T. R. </em>581, is not for the convenience of the carrier, but of the owner of the goods; for when the voyage is performed, it is for the interest of the carrier to get rid of them presently.</p>

The cases, English and American, cited by these compilers, fully maintain these distinctions, and show clearly that where the contract of carriage has been fully performed, we are not at liberty to regard the storage as incidental or accessory to that contract, but as constituting a new and different relation with the owner, or consignee.</p>
    <p id="b253-6" data-blocks='[["BL_253.6",253,[227,896,1164,644]]]'>All of the New York cases which I have examined, and we are here administering the law of a New York contract, fully recognise the above-stated distinctions, and the doctrine also that, when a box of goods is delivered to a common carrier, marked in a particular manner, without any directions, except • such as may be inferred from the marks themselves, the carrier has a right to presume that the consignor of the goods intends they shall be carried and disposed of in the usual and customary way. And if the owner neglects to make the necessary inquiries as to the usage or custom of business, or to give direction as to the disposal of goods, it is his own fault; and the loss, if any, after the carrier has performed his duty according to the course of his trade and business, should fall upon such owner, and not upon the common carrier: Van Santvoord <em>v. </em>St. John, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Hill%20160" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="6 Hill 160">6 <em>Hill </em>160</a>; Goold <em>v. </em>Chapin, 10 <em>Barbour </em>612; Clendaniel <em>v. </em>Tuckerman, <a href="/citations/?q=17%20Barb.%20189" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="17 Barb. 189">17 <em>Barb. </em>189</a>.</p>
    <p id="b253-7" data-blocks='[["BL_253.7",253,[228,1541,1163,290]]]'>The language of Justice Thompson, in Goold <em>v. </em>Chapin, cited with approbation in the last of the above cases, was, “ I think it must be implied in every contract of this nature, that if the consignee is not found, or does not immediately accept the goods when offered, the carrier may, if he so elect, keep them as bailee on deposit. His liability is not at an end entirely, but it assumes a different and less onerous character.”</p>
    <p id="b253-8" data-blocks='[["BL_253.8",253,[227,1841,1162,333]]]'>These are sufficient authorities to justify the ruling of the court. The evidence showed that the company had fully performed their duty as carriers, and that, according to the usage and custom of the road, they had deposited the goods of which the plaintiffs were not ready to accept delivery in their warehouse. The plaintiffs were bound to take notice of this usage, and, in the absence of express stipulation, it entered into and formed part of the contract.</p>
    <p id="b253-9" data-blocks='[["BL_253.9",253,[229,2184,1160,217]]]'>The liability of the company as common carriers terminated with the delivery of the goods into their storehouse.
