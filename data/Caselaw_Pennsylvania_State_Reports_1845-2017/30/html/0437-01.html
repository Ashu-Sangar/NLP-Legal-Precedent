Mr. Roper says that ‘ gifts for promoting public works for the convenience or benefit of the public, or of the inhabitants of a particular place, are considered as charitable uses:’ 2 <em>Roper on Legacies </em>101. He refers, in the same passage, to authorities where a gift for the improvement of the city of Bath; a sum of money to be applied in forming works for supplying the inhabitants of Chepstow with spring-water from St. Arvons or elsewhere; and for the support of a botanical garden at Stockwell, were respectively sustained. In Thomas <em>v. </em>Ellmaker, 1 <em>Parsons </em>98, an unincorporated fire company was held to be a charity, and authorities, both English and Pennsylvanian, are cited, fully sustaining the proposition that all cases where funds are supplied for legal, general, or public purposes, which are of a public nature, tending to the relief of the public at large, are charities. See also Blenon’s Estate, <em>Bright. Rep. </em>338. The purpose of Mr. Cresson’s legacy is germain to the objects of the corporation as a municipal corporation, and in Vidal <em>v. </em>The City, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Howard%20189" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Howard 189">2 <em>Howard </em>189</a>, the court say, ‘ if the purpose of the trust be germain to the objects of the incorporation, if they relate to matters which "will promote, aid, and perfect those objects, if they tend (as the charter of the city of Philadelphia expresses it) to the suppression of vice and immorality, to the advancement of the public health and order, and to the promotion of trade, industry, and happiness, where is the law to be found which prohibits the corporation from taking the devise upon such trusts, in a state where the statutes of mortmain do not exist, the corporation itself having a legal capacity 'to take the estate as well by devise as otherwise?” In the same opinion, the court include within these trusts, purposes confessedly charitable and beneficial to the city or the public.</p>

There is nothing in the language of the legacy which limits the application of the fund to the streets or highways. There are public squares, public buildings, and other public property belonging to the corporation, in connexion with which this trust may be fulfilled. As the gift is to a municipal corporation, it must be taken as implied, that the money is to be expended within its territorial limits, and within those limits a discretion is left to the trustee which may be exercised without illegal encroachment upon the highways. Where trustees have a discretion to apply the benefits of a charitable testamentary gift, either in a way which the law allows, or which the law disallows, the presumption is that they will act in a lawful manner: Faversham <em>v. </em>Ryder, 27 <em>Eng.

Both of these resolutions were adopted by the board, and invitations were accordingly extended to twenty-1 five prominent merchants of the city to join in the meeting. ln| pursuance thereof, the meeting was held some time prior to Janu-] ary 10th 1853, at the hall of the Mercantile Beneficial Associa<a id="p445" href="#p445" data-label="445" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*445</a>tion, at the corner of Tenth and Filbert streets, Philadelphia. Mr. Cresson, the testator, was among the persons invited to be present, and he attended and delivered an address in advocacy of the proposed objects, and, as several of the witnesses say, promised it material aid. A committee was appointed from among the persons present, upon which Mr. Cresson was placed as a member. Frequent meetings of the committee were held, and the whole subject was intrusted to their consideration. The movement at last became disconnected from the Mercantile Beneficial Association, under whose auspices it had originated, and on April 4th 1858, a meeting for definite organization as a separate body, was called at the room of the Board of Trade in the Merchants’ Exchange, Philadelphia, at which officers were chosen, Mr. Cresson being constituted a member of the board of managers; and the new society was then denominated 4 The Merchants’ Fund.’ This meeting, it will be seen, was about five months before the date of the will. Afterwards, on the 28th of January 1854, about three weeks before the death of the testator, the society became incorporated by that name.</p>

The testator, in several parts of his will, and in different language, has designated two objects of his bounty, without anything appearing in his language to show that they are necessarily to be connected together, or that the latter legacy is merely cumulative to the former.

The question is one of identification. The evidence upon that subject shows that from the inception of the plan down to the time of the meeting at the Merchants’ Exchange, it was called and known indifferently as the Refuge for Decayed Merchants, or Asylum for Decayed Merchants, or the Institution or Society for Decayed Merchants. The peculiar expression £ Decayed Merchants,’ appears to have formed the principal feature or fixed element in the name, while the term prefixed thereto was variable. This indeterminateness of one of the words employed in the designation, is doubtless explained by the fact that while the subject remained for consideration and settlement, in the hands of the committee appointed at the meeting at the cor<a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>ner of Tenth and Eilbert streets, the plan was undigested, and not fully matured, and that no final definite organization took place by officers, or by determinate title, until the meeting at the Philadelphia Exchange, when the present name was adopted.</p>

True, it is said he was chagrined at not having been elected its president, but while this might account for' a seeming disproportion between the amount of his legacy and the liberality of his professions, yet it does not appear to have been of such character as would lead to an entire revulsion of his feelings, for he spoke favourably of the society a short time before his decease. Besides, there is no other claimant, and there is no evidence of the existence of any other society with a corresponding name, or with similar objects. All that the testator has done is to use a name by which the voluntary association was known prior to its final organization, and which did not, upon the happening of that event, fall immediately into disuse.

    <p id="b450-9" data-blocks='[["BL_450.12",450,[309,1327,1155,501]]]'>The legacy to the mayor and councils of Philadelphia is assailed, not because the city is incapable of taking or holding as a trustee, but because the bequest is alleged to be too uncertain, and not a charity. If it be a charity, then, as has been shown in the appeal of The Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society, decided at this term, it is not void, because the objects are vague and uncertain, there being a trustee clothed with discretionary power over the disbursement. Is it then a charity, such as to bring it within the peculiar rules applied to charitable bequests ? It is a legacy in trust for planting and renewing shade trees, especially in situations now exposing the testator’s fellow-citizens to the heat of the sun.</p>
    <p id="b450-10" data-blocks='[["BL_450.13",450,[308,1839,1156,598]],["BL_451.1",451,[153,428,1162,260]]]'>Charity has been defined to be a general public use: <em>Amh. </em>651. In order to ascertain what are charitable uses, the English courts have generally resorted to the preamble of the Act of Parliament, 43d Elizabeth. That act enumerates twenty-one, and among them are found the following: Repairs of bridges; repairs of ports and havens; repairs of causies; repairs of seabanks; repairs of highways ; fitting out soldiers — other taxes. And beyond the enumeration contained in that act, many other gifts have been recognised at common law as gifts to charitable uses, for example: for cleansing the streets, maintenance of houses of correction; for the true labour and exercise of husbandry; for public benefit. These eases, and many others, are collected in Magill <em>v. </em>Brown, <em>Bright. </em>347. It is true, the statute of Elizabeth is not in force as a statute in Pennsylvania, but its principles are a part of our <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>common law. The case of Magill <em>v. </em>Brown was a Pennsylvania case, and there it was held that a bequest for a fire engine and hose was a gift for a charitable use. In 7 <em>Johns. Cch. </em>292, the same was ruled of a legacy for erecting a town-house. It cannot be doubted that the bequest in Mr. Oresson’s will to the mayor and councils is equally for a charitable use.</p>

The legacy is to The Pennsylvania Agricultural Society. We are of opinion that it has been allowed to the right claimant. This part of the case is ruled by Newell’s Appeal, 12 <em>Harris </em>199.</p>
