The objection loses sight of the great design of the legislature in the whole series of Acts of Assembly relative to the collection of taxes and municipal claims in the city of Philadelphia. That design was to enforce payment. This was sought to be accomplished first by making the land debtor for the tax, or for the claim for the public improvement which was supposed to have enhanced its value. <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>Thus by the Act of February 3d, 1824, <em>P. L. </em>18, all taxes, rates, and levies, were declared to be liens upon the real estate on which they are imposed or assessed. The Act of 16th April 1840, P. <em>L. </em>412-13, § 9, provided a more efficient mode in which the lien of municipal claims might be enforced. It gave authority to file of record in the office of the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas, or of the District Court, all claims and demands for pitching and paving streets, &amp;c., and for taxes, rates, and levies. The tenth section required that the claim filed should “ set forth the name of the owner, or reputed owner, of the premises against which it is filed,” with a description of the real estate, and its situation. This section also authorized the enforcement of the claim by a writ of <em>scire facias, </em>as in cases of mechanics’ liens. The Act of March 11th, 1846, P. <em>L. </em>114, gives additional facilities for the collection of the claim; and, in section four, enacts that on the trial of the <em>scire facias </em>no plea touching the question of ownership shall be allowed. It is obvious from these acts of Assembly, not only that the land is made debtor for the tax, or municipal assessment; but that the proceeding to collect, is a proceeding entirely <em>in rem. </em>The claim is not required to be filed against the time owner. It may be filed against the reputed owner; and this because the mention of the owner at all is required only as descriptive of the lands which are debtor to the tax or assessment. The requisition that the claim shall state the name of the owner, or reputed owner, is the same as that made by the Act of 1836, relative to the claims of mechanics and material men, under which it has been held that it is not necessary to set forth the name of the real owner: <a href="/watts-serg/4/0257-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 257" data-case-ids="1856271" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0257-01">4 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>257</a>. The same principle has been declared applicable to municipal claims, in Northern Liberties <em>v. </em>Coates, 3 <em>Harris </em>245; and in Claypole <em>v. </em>Dorsey, a case decided in this court in 1849, but not reported.</p>
    <p id="b67-6" data-blocks='[["BL_67.5",67,[195,1824,1161,464]]]'>It is next objected that the claim filed did not show upon its face, that it was for paving done under the provisions of the acts authorizing a lien. This was entirely unnecessary. The act which provided for its being filed, while it stated the requisites of such a claim, did not include among them a reference to itself. It has never been supposed necessary that a judgment entered without writ, upon a bond with warrant of attorney to confess judgment, was invalid, unless it referred to the Act of Assembly authorizing such entries, or that a mechanic’s claim should aver that the work done was performed under the provisions of the mechanics’ lien laws.</p>

      <em>facias. </em>The Court of Common Pleas, however, is a superior court. Though the proceedings to enforce payment of municipal claims be of statutory creation, yet when the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas has once attached, every intendment is in favour of its having been rightfully exercised. After judgment upon the <em>scire facias </em>it is too late to inquire in <em>my </em>collateral proceeding, into the sufficiency of the sheriff’s return of service of the writ, or whether service has been properly made, if it be returned. This was ruled by the late Judge Coulter, at <em>Nisi </em>Prius, in 1849, in the case of Wharton <em>v. </em>Hughes. A purchaser at sheriff’s sale under a judgment obtained in a <em>scire facias </em>on a municipal claim, is not bound to show that the Acts of Assembly have been strictly complied with. In regard to all that, he is protected by the judgment. There is no similarity between his case, and that of a purchaser at a commissioners’ sale of unseated lands for taxes, prior to the Act of 1815. He .buys -under the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, a judgment .which includes within itself an adjudication that all formal prerequisites have been .complied with.</p>
    <p id="b68-6" data-blocks='[["BL_68.5",68,[343,1259,1165,1118]]]'>There is however an objection which is fatal to the title of the plaintiff below. As already remarked, the sole design of the numerous Acts of Assembly relative' to the collection of taxes and -municipal ¡claims in the city of Philadelphia, is to enforce payment. When that has.been made, all that the legislature intended ■has been accomplished. The judgment upon the <em>scire facias </em>is a decree that the land be sold for the payment of the unpaid tax, or claim, precisely as a judgment rendered in a <em>scire facias </em>upon a mortgage, or a mechanic’s claim is a decree that the property <em>be </em>sold to satisfy the debt due the mortgagee, or the mechanic and material man. In each case the judgment is <em>in rem, </em>not in <em>personam. </em>In each case a sheriff’s sale passes to the purchaser a title, notwithstanding irregularities antecedent <em>to the judgment, </em>unless the real owner has some defence to the payment of the debt which he has had no day in court to assert. But if the owner have such defence and. was not a party to the writ of <em>scire facias, </em>he is not precluded from making it. Thus in Nace <em>v. </em>Hollenback, 1 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>540, which was an action of ejectment brought <em>by </em>a purchaser at sheriff’s sale under a judgment in a <em>scire facias </em>on a mortgage, Tilghman, C. J., declared, that if the .ierre tenant had not been a party to the writ, he might have made any defence which would have been open to him.on the <em>scire facias. </em>The same doctrine .has been asserted in very numerous cases since decided, down to the case of Walt <em>v. </em>Swinehart, 8 <em>Barr </em>97, and I am not aware that it has. ever been seriously questioned.</p>

It must be held to be equally true in case of a procedure upon a municipal claim.</p>
    <p id="b69-6" data-blocks='[["BL_69.5",69,[176,842,1163,600]]]'>It follows that the court erred in instructing the jury that the plaintiff below was entitled to recover, notwithstanding the owner was not a party to the <em>scire facias, </em>and notwithstanding the municipal claim had been paid before the writ issued. That it was paid by another instead of Robert Pollard, the owner, that it was paid in mistake by Walker, and that the amount thereof was refunded to Walker by Mr. Allison after the sale to the plaintiff below, can make no difference. The district of Spring Garden had received the money before the <em>scire facias </em>was issued in satisfaction of the debt due from the lot, and had a right to retain it. The purpose of the Acts of Assembly was therefore accomplished. It is immaterial by whom the payment was made.
