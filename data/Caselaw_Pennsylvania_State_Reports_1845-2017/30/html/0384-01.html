A submission of a matter in controversy to arbitrators is an agreement by the parties that the arbitrators shall, by award, define and settle their respective legal rights' and duties in relation"' thereto, and that they will respectively obey the award.</p>

When an award is made pursuant to the terms of the submission, it becomes the law by which the parties are to act in relation to the subject-matter that was in dispute, and they can be relieved from it only by making clear proof of such circumstances of mistake, corruption, or fraud as would justify an equitable interference with the award.</p>
    <p id="b389-11" data-blocks='[["BL_389.13",389,[164,1464,1163,217]]]'>3.
