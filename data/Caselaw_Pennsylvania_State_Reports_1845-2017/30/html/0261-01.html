The court had in mind the image of a spendthrift husband and father, who, if permitted to convert the property set apart, might deprive his <a id="p263" href="#p263" data-label="263" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*263</a>family of the comforts and benefits which the law intended to secure to them.</p>
    <p id="b263-6" data-blocks='[["BL_263.6",263,[247,501,1160,550]]]'>These cases were well enough decided on their special circumstances, but that the generalization was defective, and the construction too narrow for even the humanity of the statute, is apparent from the case in hand, where the exempted articles were liquors and liquor casks. Now the more specific the form in which the debtor should be compelled to retain such articles, the worse for his family. Only by conversion could they be made to enure to the benefit of those who were peculiarly the objects of the law’s bounty. To tell a liquor dealer he may keep $300 worth of his stock exempt from levy and- sale, but that by conversion he forfeits the benefits of the exemption, is not doing very much for his family — is, in effect, denying them altogether the benefits of the statute.</p>

    <p id="b263-8" data-blocks='[["BL_263.8",263,[247,1318,1160,641]]]'>The statute must be so construed as to permit articles of merchandise to be sold. But it is of the nature of such business to invest the proceeds of sale in other articles of merchandise, and if the statute is not to be defeated of its humane purposes, the newly-purchased goods must be held exempt. In other words, the statute must be so administered as to permit the debtor, who is a dealer, to enjoy $300 of his capital, in trade, in the form and manner in which alone it can be enjoyed, by buying and selling. And a creditor has no right to complain that it is a double exemption, which forbids him to levy his second execution on goods purchased by those which were exempted from the levy of his first execution. It is not a double exemption, but a single one, carried over to the new stock, and running along with the debtor’s business, in such manner as to make the statute available to <em>him, </em>as well as to other poor debtors.</p>

So much property the law allows him, and surely the law will not punish him for using it in a lawful manner for the support of his family.</p>
