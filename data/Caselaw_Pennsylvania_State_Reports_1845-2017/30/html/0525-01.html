The deed contained the following clause:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b525-10" data-blocks='[["BL_525.8",525,[179,1315,1162,764]]]'>“In consideration whereof, the said Amos W. Harding doth covenant and agree, to and with the said Ogden Pratt and Sarah E. his wife, their heirs and assigns, to make a good and sufficient docking along the creek side of said lot, to prevent the water from flowing over on said lot, and in case of inability or neglect in making and keeping up said docking, the said Ogden Pratt and Sarah E. his wife, and their heirs and assigns, are to have the privilege of making the same for ever; and to secure the payment of all expenses arising therefrom, they are to have the privilege of adding it to the purchase-money; and further, the lot itself shall always be security to indemnify for said expenses. It is hereby further understood and agreed, that the said Ogden Pratt and Sarah E. his wife, their heirs and assigns, reserve the right of taking the water across said lot in pipes or logs to be laid under ground, at any point where it will not interfere with buildings that said Harding may build; also reserve the right and privilege of making said docking, and the expenses shall be a continual lien on said lot of land.”</p>

On the 25th July 1855, Pratt gave notice to Harding that he must build the docking, pursuant to his agreement. After a lapse of two or three weeks, the defendant having neglected to comply with this notice, the plaintiff went on and constructed the docking, and brought this suit to recover the expenses thereof.</p>

The work is to be maintained also by Harding after it is constructed, and that part of the agreement establishes a relation of duty essentially connected with ownership, and it stands in the title and runs with it: 27 <em>State Rep. </em>258; 23 <em>Id. </em>316.</p>

Plainly enough, we cannot help implying his acceptance of the terms of the grant, and this is an agreement by him, not under his seal, and he may be sued in <em>assumpsit </em>for a breach of it; though, perhaps, the law would also imply a covenant, if necessary.</p>
