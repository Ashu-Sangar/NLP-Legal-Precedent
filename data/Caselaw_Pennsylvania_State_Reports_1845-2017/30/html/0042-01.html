We cannot presume that the legislature intended to assume or exercise any unconstitutional power over private contracts, but only that, supposing that they were granting a valuable privilege, they omitted to make provision for those who should refuse to accept it. They did not decide that the new stock was equivalent to the old, and should be taken as a compensation for it, but merely acted on the supposition that it would be accepted as equal.</p>

The constitution requires that it shall be done only by due course of law, before the judicial tribunals, and on hearing of the parties; and in that way it is often done. In the partition of interests in real estate, ships, mercantile and manufacturing establishments, courts always proceed by divesting titles and interests of one kind, and substituting others. And this arises from the necessity of such cases. It is an inherent quality of all associated intex-ests that they may be converted into separate interests; and if it were not so, such interests would often be worthless to some owners, because of disagreements among them which the law could not correct, and the disorders of such associations would be an incurable evil.</p>
