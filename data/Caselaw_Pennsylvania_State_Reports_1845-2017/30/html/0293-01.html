The complaint regards eighteen windows obstructed and darkened by a party-wall erected by the adjoining owner. Was this an eviction or disturbance for which the lessor is answerable by reason of the covenants entered into with the lessees ? This depends upon the contract, and the right of the lessor to the premises. It will not be denied, that if the lessor had conveyed or leased by express terms to the lessees, a right to the unobstructed enjoyment of light and air over the vacant lot, for and during their term, he would have been answerable for it, in case of eviction or disturbance. It would have been a clear breach of his covenant for quiet enjoyment. ■ Although it is truly said that these elements are of <em>“ </em>common right,” yet, so far as they descend upon, or exist above, a man’s ground, they are as much his property as is the ground itself, subject, of course, to the common use of all while on the premises. So a lateral approach of light and air may be an easement; <em>dale and Whatley </em>191; the right being subject to be acquired by grant or prescription, and of course to be lost in the same way.</p>

Had the lessor conveyed, either expressly or by implication, anything, the title to which this assertion or exercise of ownership by the adjoiner was paramount ? In the lease itself, although it was very special, and defined clearly what the parties had respectively undertaken to do, yet there was not one word in regard to these windows, or the enjoyment of light and air through them. There was no express undertaking on the subject, and no breach of the covenant on that account.</p>
    <p id="b296-6" data-blocks='[["BL_296.5",296,[283,796,1159,944]]]'>Did the right pass under the term <em>“ </em>appurtenances” in the lease ? If it had been offered to prove that a right to an easement of the kind existed in the lessor, and had been attached to his building, it would most certainly have so passed. In fact it would then have been part of the thing granted, and would have passed as an incident by any terms that would convey the principal. But there was not the slightest attempt to show that this was the case, or that such an easement ever existed by grant, prescription, occupancy, or in any other way. In no case is the ordinary enjoyment of light and air an appurtenance to property; it only becomes so by a right of way or approach derived by purchase — in England by prescription — in modern times by prior occupancy for twenty years. It is thought this doctrine is inapplicable to our country, and has never been adopted as the law of the land. It certainly seems not to be recognised in this Commonwealth. But nothing is predicated of it in this case, as it does not appear that the Columbia Hotel was erected one, or five, or ten years before the new erection. The word <em>“ </em>appurtenances” in the lease, therefore, did not apply to light and air in their ordinary descent; and as the lessor had no special property, or a right of passage to his windows over his neighbour’s property, it did not pass in that, shape.</p>
    <p id="b296-7" data-blocks='[["BL_296.6",296,[281,1735,1160,691]],["BL_297.1",297,[217,408,1157,87]]]'>Had the vacant lot belonged to the lessor at the time of leasing, then an easement by implication, in the passage of light and air, would have followed: Maynard <em>v. </em>Esher, 5 <em>Harris </em>226; Story <em>v. </em>Odin, <a href="/mass/12/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="12 Mass. 157" data-case-ids="2052001" data-case-paths="/mass/12/0139-01">12 <em>Mass. </em>157</a>. There seems to be no doubt of this. But such an implication exists only in case of ownership. To extend it to a case where there was no ownership, would simply make the rule universal, and imply an easement for the passage of these elements whenever one happened to build adjoining vacant ground; a doctrine which neither reason nor policy could sanction. But the implication arising out of ownership only, is an argument of power against its extension to non-ownership. It undoubtedly does not so extend. The passage of light and air over adjoining lands, unlike that of water, affords <em>per se </em>no evidence of the enlargement of such by an easement: <em>Gale and Whatley </em>191. So no presumption could have arisen in this case that the lessor had any right to an easement by being the prior builder on his lot. <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>And the law itself forbids the lessees from regarding it as such — ■ if they were deceived it was their own fault.</p>

We think he was not bound to do so; and that if the evidence had been received it would have furnished no evidence of fraud on part of the lessor, or become the foundation in equity for relief of the lessee. The substance of the complaint regarded something that the lessor was no more presumed to know than the lessees — it was nothing which concerned the title of the lessor or the title he was about to pass to the lessees. It was a collateral fact — something only within the knowledge and determination of a stranger to both parties, and, if material to either, I can see no obligation resting on either side to furnish to the other the information. It was not alleged that'the lessor made any representations on the subject, or that there was any concealment of the information; or that any relation of trust and confidence existed between the parties; or that the lessees were misled by his silence, and entered into the contract under the belief that the vacant lot would not be occupied; or that they were in a position in which they could not by diligence have ascertained the fact for themselves, and that they were not legally bound to take notice of the probability that the ground would be occupied by buildings, and inquire for themselves. These were elements to be shown to constitute fraud, and make the testimony available.</p>

In all these, and kindred cases, there must be no false representations, nor purposed concealments: all must be truly stated and fully disclosed. “ The vendor and vendee,” says <em>Athinson on Marketable Titles </em>134, “in the absence of special circumstances, are to be considered as acting at arm’s length.” “ When the means of information as to the facts and circumstances affecting the value of the subject of sale are equally accessible to both parties, and neither of them does anything to impose on the other, the disclosure of any superior knowledge which one party may <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>have over the other, is not requisite to the validity of the contract:” <em><a href="/mass/12/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="12 Mass. 157" data-case-ids="2052001" data-case-paths="/mass/12/0139-01">Id.</a> </em>Illustrative of this is the celebrated case of Laidlaw <em>v. </em>Organ, <a href="/us/15/0178-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 Wheat. 178" data-case-ids="1444853" data-case-paths="/us/15/0178-01">2 <em>Wheaton </em>178</a>. The parties had been negotiating for the purchase of a quantity of tobacco; the buyer got private information of the conclusion of peace with Great Britain, and called, very early in the morning following the receipt of it, on the holders of the tobacco, and, ascertaining that they had received no intelligence of the peace, purchased it at a great profit. The contract was contested for fraud and concealment. Chief Justice Marshall delivered the opinion of the court, to the effect that the buyer was not bound to communicate intelligence of extrinsic circumstances which might influence the price, though it were exclusively in his possession. And Chief Justice Gibson, in Kintzing <em>v. </em>McElrath, 5 <em>Barr </em>467, in commenting on this decision, says: “It would be difficult to circumscribe the contrary doctrine within proper limits, where the means of intelligence are equally accessible to both parties.” See also Hershey <em>v. </em>Keembortz, 6 <em>Barr </em>129. When the information is derived from strangers to the parties negotiating, and not affecting the quality or title of the thing negotiated for, it is not such as the opposite party can call for. We see no error in the rejection of the evidence on account of this part of the proposition, as there was no moral or legal obligation for the lessor to disclose any information he had on the subject of the intended improvement of the adjoining lot. It was not in the line of his title. It was derived from a stranger; it might be true or false; and the lessees could have got it by inquiry as well as the lessor.</p>
