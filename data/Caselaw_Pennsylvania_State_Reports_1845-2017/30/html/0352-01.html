    <p class="summary" id="b354-7" data-blocks='[["BL_354.7",354,[297,753,1167,1242]]]'>“ The proceedings in this case were originally commenced before two justices, under the Act of 1836, to obtain possession of the land in dispute, which had been sold at sheriff’s .sale as the property of Abraham Green, and purchased in by the plaintiff. The defendant being in possession made the oath prescribed by the statute, and the proceedings were removed into this court. By that oath, he in substance declares that he did not come into possession of the land under Abraham Green, and that he does not claim to hold it by a title derived from him, subsequent to the judgment upon which it was sold, but in his own right, and under a different and independent title. If we understand the defendant’s counsel aright, it is claimed that these proceedings must be dismissed, and the plaintiff turned over to his action of ejectment, in ease it should be established to the satisfaction of the court and jury, that the defendant did not go into the possession of the land under Green, and does not claim to hold it under him. The court dissent from this. The defendant asserts that he holds a paramount title, one that overrides the right of the plaintiff under the sheriff’s deed. The defendant becomes an actor in the court, for the establishment of his paramount title; and we have to inquire whether he had such a title as, under all the facts in the case, ought in law to defeat the plaintiff in the recovery of the possession. The defendant’s title, and the manner in which it was acquired, as well as the circumstances under which he obtained the possession, are all proper subjects of investigation. The inquiry into all the rights of the parties is as broad and full, as it would be in an action of ejectment, except that the plaintiff is confined to his right under the sheriff’s deed, and the defendant is not at liberty to set up any title inconsistent with his oath before the justices.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b354-8" data-blocks='[["BL_354.8",354,[304,1996,1160,428]],["BL_355.1",355,[210,406,1163,474]]]'>“ It is contended that the title relied upon by the defendant is not a different title from that claimed by Abraham Green, and which became vested in the plaintiff by the sheriff’s sale, and, therefore, that the defendant cannot set it up to defeat the plaintiff’s recovering. By a different title we understand a title not in any way derived under or through the defendant in the execution. Here the legal title was originally in the Bingham estate, and an equity growing out of and connected with that title was in Abraham Green; and that it was that equity alone that the sheriff sells and that the plaintiff purchased. Although parts of the <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>same title, they are totally distinct and different rights, independent of each other, each subject to liens against the respective owners, the one is conveyed without in the least affecting the other. In the hands of the same owner the equity becomes merged in the legal title, constituting one entire and complete right or title in the hands of different owners. They constitute different and wholly independent rights and titles; and so they are to be regarded in this case. The point of inquiry then is, —Can the defendant avail himself of his legal title, under the evidence in this cause, to protect himself in the possession, or ought he to be compelled to surrender the possession to the plaintiff?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.6",355,[207,879,1164,389]]]'>“On the 5th of July 1838, the Bingham estate contracted this land to Lyman Robinson, who went into possession, and improved by clearing some twenty-six acres, and erecting a house. Under this contract, he acquired a substantial and valuable equity in the land. While thus in possession, judgment in favour of the plaintiff was entered against Robinson, on which the land was sold, and a sheriff’s deed made to the plaintiff in November 1842. This vested the equitable interest in the plaintiff: that is, the right to the land itself, subject to the payment of the purchase-money.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b355-7" data-blocks='[["BL_355.7",355,[207,1266,1163,1162]],["BL_356.1",356,[296,413,1158,851]]]'>“ On the 25th of January 1843, Bush contracted this land to Abraham Green, and on the same day entered judgments against him to the amount of $1100. Green remained in possession over one year, when he moved off about one hundred rods into another lot and informed the agent of the Bingham estate that he could not pay the purchase-money. On or about this same time (when Abraham Green left the possesion), Peter Green, Abraham’s brother, who lived many miles away from the land, entered into a contract with the Bingham estate for the land. It was not competent for that estate thus to divest the equitable right of the plaintiff. The records of this court informed its agent that Robinson’s equity had become vested in the plaintiff. Was there collusion in this business between Abraham and Peter Green ? Did they well understand each other? In the winter or spring of 1843, Abraham Green went into possession of this land under Bush, the plaintiff; he remained upon it over a year; that is, down to the spring or summer of 1844; he then undertook to surrender the old Robinson contract, not having paid a cent to Bush, and moved off about one hundred rods on another lot, and, July 22d, Peter, his brother stepped in, obtained a new contract from the Bingham estate, and in March 1845, a deed. Was there no understanding between these brothers in this business ? If there was an understanding, then Peter Green’s possession was collusive and fraudulent as against the right of the plaintiff, and he, if he were a party, would be bound to surrender the possession to the plaintiff. Would Walker under such a state of facts stand in any better position than Peter Green ? The court think not. The proceedings were commenced <a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>July 1846, and the deed from Peter Green to Walker is dated 29th May 1846. Thus, after Walker had been served with notice to quit, he went and procured the title from his brother-in-law, Peter Green. The whole case looks as if these brothers and brothers-in-law had put their heads together to defraud the plaintiff out of his right. If the jury believe that there was an understanding between Abraham and Peter Green about this business, that Abraham should go out and Peter get the Bingham title, and take the possession, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover. The holder of the legal title, if he found the possession abandoned— really so — might in good faith enter, and being in possession might-hold until his purchase-money was paid; but not when he obtained the possession with any purpose of defeating the equitable right of his vendee, or those claiming under him. The records and the sheriff’s sale was notice to the parties, of the liens upon and the rights acquired to this equitable interest, under the Robinson contract. If the rents and profits of the lands in the hands of Walker were equal to the balance of purchase-money due on the Robinson contract, then the plaintiff would, in equity, have the whole title, and will be entitled to recover.</p>

It was right to treat it as a trick. Then his brother Peter’s purchase, after the levy on the land under Bush’s execution, and the transfer to his brother-in-law, Walker, after the sheriff’s sale, and after the commencement of this suit, became very plainly and naturally suspicious, and called for evidence on their side that they were honest purchasers for value paid.
