Philadelphia to Phoenixville. It appears from the evidence, that in the early part of the month of July 1854, the plaintiff was a passenger in the train of cars belonging to the defendant, used to carry passengers on the before-mentioned road; — that when near to Phoenixville the locomotive which drew the train, struck a cow passing across the track, knocked her off the track, but in her struggles she threw herself under the wheels of the second car, in which the plaintiff was seated, overset it, and inflicted on the plaintiff the injury which it is said he received. At or near where the accident happened, the railroad crossed on a bridge, a public highway, fifteen feet below the railroad; and on one side of the said public highway a private way raised the bank on to a level with the railway, while on the other side a path conducted to the same level, neither side having any fence to protect the railway from intrusion. The engineer saw the cow as she climbed the upper part of the pathway, reversed the engine, gave notice to the brakemen to put down the brakes, and used all the means in his power to stop the train, but the distance was not great enough to accomplish his purpose, and the accident we have noticed occurred. It is proper to remark that the road was in good order, the wheels had been carefully examined during the day, the cars were sound, and the train was running when the cow was discovered, below the usual speed, at the rate of eighteen miles an hour. <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>
      <em>I see nothing in the case, to warrant the imputation of censure, or of negligence, towards the agents of the company, </em>although the distances at which the cow could be seen, have been variously stated, and the evidence on the point has been examined by counsel. It is also fair to notice, that the plaintiff was inside the car of the defendant, seated on one of the seats occupied by passengers, and negligence of no kind can be imputed to him. Such would seem to have been the condition of the parties to this suit when the injury complained of is said to have been inflicted.</p>

    <p id="b236-7" data-blocks='[["BL_236.6",236,[292,1154,1163,1286]],["BL_237.1",237,[243,436,1171,1592]]]'>“ This question .has never in terms been determined. I have already said that <em>the evidence does not disclose any negligence on the part of the agents of the company. </em>Notwithstanding the criticism as to the distance at which this cow could be seen, and the employment to which the attention of the engineer .was directed when the cow first came in sight, <em>no proof of negligence has been exhibited against the agents and engineers, which would authorize me to submit it to the consideration of the jury. </em>Passing by the circumstances of the accident which we have heard detailed, it is undoubted, that the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company is a purchaser, in consideration of public accommodation, of the privilege of using its road for the transportation of passengers, by means of locomotive engines; the evidence is uncontradicted, that at the time of the accident, the said company was using its road in accordance with its chartered privileges and in the usual way. In such use of its road the company is responsible for the direct and immediate consequences of errors committed by itself or its agents, and not for accidents resulting from causes beyond its control. <em>It is, indeed, laid down, and is undoubted law, that the proprietors of a railroad, as passenger carriers, are bound to the most exact care and diligence, not only in the management of their trains and cars, but also in the structure and care of their track, and in all the arrangements necessary to the safety of passengers. They are held to the strictest responsibility for care, vigilance, and skill on the part of themselves, and all persons employed by them. Do this care, vigilance, and shill, require the company to provide suitable fences and guards to keep cattle off the railroad ? I cannot consent to adopt that opinion. </em>The language of Chief Justice Gibson bears strongly on this point. It is conceded, says that eminent <em>judge </em>— ‘ That an <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>American company is not bound to fence its railway, as an American farmer is bound to fence his fields. In a country so new and sparse as ours, of which the trunks of the principal railways are more extensive than in the island of Great Britain, the cost of fencing them would be greater than could be borne. The rights and responsibilities of a people are shaped by the circumstances of their condition. If they will have railways, they must be content to have them in the only way they are practicable. If an owner suffer his cattle to be at large, it must be at the risk of losing them, or paying for their transgressions.’ These observations made by Judge Gibson, in a case between the railroad company and the owner of a cow which had been killed on the track, bears strongly on the case you are trying. It declares, in terms, that in Pennsylvania a railroad company is not bound to fence its road. The fair and just inference is, that where an animal, as a cow, is run over by a train of cars, and these cars, or some of them, being thrown off the track, injures a passenger, no negligence on that account is attributable to the company. Where there are no fences cattle will trespass. If a railroad company are not bound to fence, it was no neglect that this company did not fence. <em>I hold, therefore, that the presence of the cow on the track was not the result of negligence in the company. The company could not be expected to guard against her approach, were not bound to do so, and, in the language of Judge Gribson, the engineer is not bound to stop his train the moment he sees cattle on the track, however distant. </em>Negligence in injuring passengers, by wantonly, indifferently, or negligently running over an animal on the track, is punishable in damages in an action against the company, but where due care has been exercised, as would seem to be the case in the instance before us, the company are not liable to damages. In this view of the case, I affirm the proposition of the defendant, that <em>if the jury believe the testimony in this cause, there was no negligence on the part of the defendant or its agents, and the plaintiff is not entitled to recover. </em>Should the jury take this view of the case there will be no need to go into the question of damages, for the verdict should be for the defendant. Should we be wrong in the conclusion we have come to, the Supreme Court will set us right.”</p>

And grant that the owner is bound to indemnify the company for the mischief she caused, yet, as between the company and its passenger, liability is to be measured by the terms of their contract. Having undertaken to carry safely, and holding themselves out to the world as able to do so, they are not to suffer cows to endanger the life of the passenger any more than a defective rail or axle. Whether they maintain an armed police at cross roads, as is done by similar companies in Europe, or fence, or place cattle guards within the bed of their road, or, by other contrivance, exclude this risk, is for themselves to consider and determine. We do not say they are bound to do the one or the other, but if by some means they do not exclude the risk, they are bound to respond in damages when injury accrues. Perhaps the passenger would have remedy against the owner of the cow— it is clear from Skinner’s Case that the company would — but the passenger has unquestionable remedy against the company.

If a road runs through a farmer’s pasture grounds, where his cattle are wont to be, possibly, as between the company and the farmer, the latter may be bound to fence; but, as between the company and the passenger, the company are bound to see that the cattle are fenced out. If cattle are accustomed to wander on unenclosed grounds, through which the road runs, the company are bound to take notice of this fact; and, either by fencing in their track, or by enforcing the owner’s obligation to keep his cattle at home, or by moderating the speed of the train, or in some other manner, to secure the safety of the passenger. That is their paramount duty. To enable them to perform it, the law entitles them to a clear track: 7 <em>Harris </em>298; 12 <em>Harris </em>469. Neither cows nor men, not even the servants of the company engaged in the company’s work, are permitted to obstruct it. And because their right to a clear tract is absolute, their duty to carry safely is imperative.
