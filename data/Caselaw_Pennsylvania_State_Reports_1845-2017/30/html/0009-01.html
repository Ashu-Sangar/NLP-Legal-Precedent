      <em>"We </em>do not’consider it necessary to express any opinion on the question whether the holder of a certificate of the state loan has such a pledge of the tolls on the state canals and railroads as could be enforced in a court of justice. Conceding, for the purposes of the present motion, that he has such a pledge, we are nevertheless of opinion -that the right of a pledgee extends no further than to require a sale of the thing pledged, and an application of the proceeds to the payment of his claim. This is what the Act of Assembly proposes to accomplish. It is what a court- of equity would do under the' circumstances disclosed, if the'controversy were between private individuals. But the legislature has the right to prescribe <em>remedies </em>and change them at pleasure, so that the <em>rights </em>of the parties are not materially impaired. <em>We </em>? are perfectly satisfied that the rights of the state creditors will not \be impaired by a fair public sale of the Main Line to the highest land best bidder, and the application of the proceeds to the payment of the state debt. On the contrary, we are bound to presume, from the evidence before us, that such a proceeding will i be highly beneficial to the creditors of the state. It will reduce jL the amount of the public debt, and render the residue more secure. <em>\ We </em>have no right to presume that the works will be sold for less i than their full value. The creditor has therefore no case for relief on the footing of the pledge of the tolls on the public works.</p>

It is alleged that the legislature have no constitutional authority to bind succeeding legislatures in these particulars. If such a contract be unconstitutional and void, the canal commissioners are in the line of their duty in suggesting this objection to the court; and if the court should hold the Act of Assembly void, it would be the duty of the commissioners, as faithful agents of the state, intrusted with the custody and management of the works, to retain possession of them for the use of the Commonwealth, regardless of the unauthorized attempt to deprive the public of their rights.

According to the ancient common law, where there is no statute provision to the. contrary, upon the civil death of a corporation, all its real estate remaining unsold reverts back to the original grantors and their heirs. The debts due to and from the corporation are all extinguished. Neither stockholders, nor the directors, nor trustees, can recover debts or be charged with them in their natural capacity. All the personal estate vests in the Commonwealth: 2 <em>Kent’s Com. </em>307; 1 <em>Bl. Com. </em>484. But under the modern rule of equity jurisprudence, the severity of the common law in this respect is greatly mitigated, and it is held that it is the <em>franchise, </em>and not the property of the corporation, that is forfeited by a judgment of ouster, and that the property of the corporation is a trust fund for the payment of debts, and distribution among stockholders: Wood <em>v. </em>Summer, 3 <em>Mason’s R. </em>309; Adair <em>v. </em>Shaw, 1 <em>Sch. &amp; Lefr. </em>261; Mumma <em>v. </em>The Potomac Company, <a href="/us/33/0281-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="8 Pet. 281" data-case-ids="1438395" data-case-paths="/us/33/0281-01">8 <em>Peters </em>281</a>; Stainton <em>v. </em>The Carron Company, 23 <em>Eng.

This provision does' not vary very materially from the rule which equity would adopt, independent of the Act of Assembly. It is no release of the punishment for injury or abuse. Nor is it a release of the eminent domain under which the corporation may be repealed without either abuse or misuse whenever the public interest requires it, on giving just compensation to the stockholders. The word “ may,” as applied to the action of the legislature in this respect, is not to be construed as “shall” or “must.” If the construction were doubtful, the doubt must be resolved in favour of the state. A corporation can never claim a privilege against the state without showing that it is clearly entitled to it by the terms of the charter. .There is nothing in this section which binds the legislature to make “ full compensation to the stockholders.” That is only to be done if the legislature should by a legislative act revoke the privileges granted; but there is no obligation on their part to pass any act of revocation. If this should not be done, the judgment of ouster, with all its legal and equitable incidents, would remain in full force. There is therefore no release of the right to punish for misuse or abuse, nor any release of the eminent domain, in the provisions contained in the 15th section of the Act of Assembly.</p>

The Act of Assembly"bf 16th May 1857, makes provision for a public sale; and, for the purpose of inviting competition, directs that public notice of the time and place be given in one <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>or more newspapers, of extended circulation, published in the cities of Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Washington, Boston, New York, and in the borough o£ Harrisburg. It authorizes “ any person or persons, or railroad or canal company now incorporated, or which may hereafter be incorporated, under the laws of this Commonwealth, to become the purchasers for any sum not less than $7,500,000.” But there is a <em>proviso </em>in the 3d section, which declares that “ if the Pennsylvania Railroad Company shall become ¡the purchasers, at the said public sale, or by assignment, they ighall pay, in addition to the purchase-money at which it may be Struck down, the sum of 1,500,000 dollars, and <em>in consideration </em>ithereof,, the said railroad company and the Harrisburg, Mount jjoy and Lancaster Railroad Company shall be discharged by the /Commonwealth <em>for ever </em>from the payment of all taxes upon tontnage, or freight carried over said railroads; and the said Pennsylvania Railroad Company shall also be released from the payment of all other taxes or duties on its capital stock, bonds, dividends, or property, except for school, city, county, borough, or township purposes.” The amount of taxes proposed to be released is beyond calculation. It can only be conjectured. It would be greatly increased by the tax, which would of course be levied on the property about to be sold to the company. Judging from the increase during the last five years, and the constant augmentation of commerce and travel along the route, it would seem reasonable to believe that in five years from this time it would be double its present amount. But conceding that the tax to be released will hereafter amount to no more, per annum, than the sum paid in 1856, the amount, according to the admissions of the railroad company itself, would be $280,739.21 per annum for ever. This sum is more than equal to the interest on $5,600,000, at 5 per cent., the rate to be charged to the purchasers. In other words, the Act of Assembly proposes to give to the railroad company a consideration equal to $5,600,000, for $1,500,000, and thus to /give that company an advantage equal to $4,100,000 over every '¡other bidder at the sale ! By means of this privilege the Pennfsylvania Railroad Company máy drive from the field of compe|tition all other bidders. It is essential to every fair public auction «that all the bidders shall stand upon an equal footing. If the object had been to make a fair sale of this portion of the state revenue, it might have been evinced by a provision for the transfer of it to the highest bidder, without any distinction in favour of .any one. But this was not done. The extraordinary <em>proviso </em>in [favour of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company is partial, and ^entirely repugnant to the general intent of the act; and if allowed ito stand, the sale under it will furnish one of the most magnificent [¡exhibitions of a <em>“mock </em>auction” that the world has ever witnessed !

Individuals cannot subsist without food. Deprive them of “ the means whereby” they live, and you destroy them as certainly as if you did it by shedding their blood. The necessities of governments are as great as those of individuals. No government can exist without revenues to defray its expenses, and support its officers and agents. The revenue is the food indispensable to its existence.

It has no more right to commit political ,s.uicide than an individual has to destroy the life given by ETs "Creator. Contracting away the taxing power in perpetuity tends, as vre have seen, inevitably to the destruction of the government. If twelve or twenty millions of taxable property may be released to-day, one hundred millions may be released to-morrow, and the principle being established, the process might go on until all power to raise revenue was gone. If this did not destroy the government, it would result in something infinitely more dangerous to the liberties of the people. It would make it the servile dependant of the wealthy corporations or individuals to whom it contracted away its means of support. Although the taxing power is but an incidental one, to be exercised only as the necessary means of performing governmental duties, it is nevertheless a branch of the legislative power which always, in its nature, implies not only the power of making laws, but of altering and repealing them, as the exigencies of the state and circumstances of the times may require : <em>Mutherforth’s Institutes of Natural Law, </em>B. 3, ch. 3, § 3. If one portion of the legislative power may be sold, another may be disposed of in the.same way. If the power to raise revenue may be sold to-day, the power to punish for crimes may be sold to-morrow, and the power to pass laws for the redress of civil rights, may be sold the next day. If the legislative powrer may be sold, the executive and judicial powers may be put in the market with equal propriety. The result to which the principle must inevitably lead, proves that the sale of any portion of govern<a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>mental power is utterly inconsistent with the nature of our free institutions, and totally at variance with the object and general provisions of the constitution of the state. It may be urged that we must confide in the fidelity of the legislature, and that there is every ground for hope that they would not carry such measures to an unreasonable length. This is no answer to the argument. It is a question of constitutional authority, and not a case of confidence at all. Limitations of power, established by written constitutions, have their origin in a distrust of the infirmity of man.

It was held by this court in Wood’s Estate, 9 <em>Harris </em>114, that “the duties of sovereign and subject are reciprocal, and any person who is protected by a government in his person or property, may be compelled to pay for that protection. As taxes are to be assessed for the sole purpose of supporting the government, the propriety of exacting them, the persons and property to be made liable, and the rules for their assessment and collection, are to be determined by its authority. It is, however, <em>a rule of the public law, founded on a principle of justice which no government can disregard without violating the rights of its citizens, that taxes shall be assessed in such manner that all the citizens may pay their quota in proportion to their abilities, and the advantages they derive from the </em>society 9 <em>Harris </em>114; 10 <em>Harris </em>497. This principle is sanctioned by writers of the highest authority: <em>Vattel, </em>B. 1, ch. 20, § 240; <em>Rutherforth’s Inst, of Nat. Law, </em>B. 2, ch. 3, § 5; <em>Puffendorfs Law of Nations, </em>B. 7, ch. 9, § 10. It is expressly declared by Baron Puffendorf, that “ no immunities or exemptions” (from taxation) ought to be “ granted to certain persons to the defrauding or oppressing of the rest.” It is upon this principle that when the private property of the citizen is ¿taken for public use, just compensation is to be made to him <em>out I of the common fund, </em>in order that the contribution to the public <em>I </em>interest may fall in a just proportion upon all the citizens: <em>Ruther</em>I <em>forth, </em>B. 2, ch. 3, § 5. As the legislature are necessarily the judges of the method of assessing taxes, it is to be presumed that they have regarded the rule of contribution sanctioned by justice and the equal rights of the citizens; and their enactments are not always subject to judicial review. Where they make appropriations to institutions of learning or charity, or grant lands or pensions to persons who have served in the defence of the nation, it is presumed to be a compensation for the good that has been done or is to be done to the community. Where they grant to the same institutions or individuals an exemption from taxation, <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>such grants, for the same reason, are not regarded as a violation of the rules of justice and equity. So long as there is no <em>contract, </em>which may tie the hands of succeeding legislatures against repealing such exemptions; and so long as they are not repealed, they seem to have been enforced as a legitimate exercise of legislative power: 1 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>62; <a href="/watts/6/0435-01" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="6 Watts 435" data-case-ids="1846146" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0435-01">6 <em>Watts </em>435</a>. But where there is no pretence of an intention to equalize the taxation among the people, but an avowed purpose to sell to one class of citizens an exemption from all taxes for ever, and thus to throw all the public burdens upon the other for all time to come, it is, to all intents and purposes, imposing a tax upon them without the consent of their representatives, and is such a plain, palpable, and open violation of the rights and liberties of the people, such a clear case of transcending the just limits of legislative power, that the judiciary is bound to pronounce such an act null and void.</p>

Tbe decisions of tbe supreme courts of the several states, o.n the construction of the constitution and laws of their respective states, are, in like manner, binding on the Supreme Court of the United States. That court has no more right to overrule a judgment of a state court, on a question of state law, than the state court has to overrule the United States court on a question of United States law. All contracts are to be construed and understood according to the law of the place where they are made and to be performed. The laws and constitution of a state are to be construed and understood everywhere according to the judicial construction which they receive in the state where they are made and are to operate. This is the rule of jurisprudence which prevails universally throughout the civilized world. It is the rule which always ought to govern, and which generally does govern the Supreme Court of the United States. Wherever there is a departure from it, the necessary result is to impair public confidence in that exalted tribunal, and to introduce disastrous confusion into the administration of the law. It cannot be expected that the judges of the federal court should be as familiar with the constitution, laws, and usages of Ohio, as the supreme judges of that state, who reside within her limits, who have been chosen on account of their acquaintance with her laws, and whose especial business it is to expound them. The decision of the highest judicial .tribunal in a state, on the construction of the state constitution, or a state law, is authoritative everywhere, when the same question arises, because it is pronounced by the only tribunal having direct and immediate jurisdiction over the question. The decision of the United States court, on the same point, where it incidentally arises, is not authority elsewhere, because it has no direct and immediate jurisdiction over the question. Its duty is to receive the state law as it is expounded in the tribunal of the last resort in the state. These views furnish a plain rule for estimating the value of the conflicting decisions which have been cited. We have no hesitation in adopting the decisions of the state courts, on all questions respecting the meaning of their own state constitutions, and the extent of the powers which the people of the states have therein granted to the different departments of their own state governments. It may be added that the United States court was divided in opinion on this question, three eminent judges of that court dissenting, while the state court was unanimous. And it is but just to say, that the opinion of the state court is sustained by a course of argument which has never been satisfactorily answered in the United States court, or elsewhere.</p>

But, if he consents to perform a ministerial act, the judicial power to administer justice and to restrain against acts contrary to law, cannot thereby be arrested or evaded.

There are no words in the constitution which expressly declare, that the legislature shall not relinquish the power to impose taxes upon persons or property, nor is such prohibition to be necessarily implied from any of the restrictions imposed upon legislative action; but unless the power to part with the right to tax, passed to the General Assembly by the grant of legislative power, it does not exist, although not forbidden. It is difficult, if not entirely impossible, to define with precision in what the legislative or law making power consists; but it is very clear that it is not an absolute power to do whatever the General Assembly may determine to do; for, if it were, there <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>would practically be but one department of government instead of three; or, at least, the executive and judicial departments would be at the mercy, and under the control, of the legislative department; and our much valued system of checks and restraints completely destroyed.</p>
    <p id="b38-6" data-blocks='[["BL_38.5",38,[315,627,1160,520]]]'>The power to impose taxes is entirely legislative in its character, and the General Assembly is possessed of this power to the fullest extent; for it was conferred by the people without restriction or limitation. It was conferred, however, to be used as the exigencies of the government required, and not to be bartered away to answer present purposes at the expense of the future. The power to impose taxes does not include the power to grant immunity from taxation, any more than the power to provide punishment for the commission of crime implies the power to grant exemption from all punishment. To deduce the right to contract the power away from the right to exercise it; is to claim the right to destroy, because the right to preserve is conceded.</p>
    <p id="b38-7" data-blocks='[["BL_38.6",38,[314,1144,1167,1288]],["BL_39.1",39,[197,417,1162,129]]]'>The power of taxation, for the purpose of raising a regular and adequate revenue to defray the expenses of the government, is indispensably necessary to the very existence of the government; and if it may be contracted away in part, it may be in the whole, and the government thereby destroyed. I have already said that the power of taxation was given without stint or restraint by the people to their representatives; not to the General Assembly of 1857 alone, but to its successors, as well as its predecessors. Where, then, did one legislature obtain the power to lessen or weaken that to be exercised by the next ? If particular property can be placed outside of the power of the government to reach it for taxation, particular persons may be in a like manner privileged, and so may classes of persons, or those holding to a particular religion or political faith; suppose the General Assembly should declare that all taxes should be assessed upon the persons and property of the members of a certain political party, and that that the persons and property of all others should be, for all time to come, released from taxation; would any one doubt but that here would be an excess of power ? Probably not; and yet in principle it is difficult to conceive how the extent or form of the exemption, can vary the question of constitutional right. I do not deny the power of the legislature to exempt particular property from taxation with or without consideration, or to select objects of taxation; but I do most distinctly affirm, that such legislative acts of exemption, as well as those of selection, may always be amended or repealed by subsequent legislation. The proposition contained in the bill under consideration, is not simply to release taxes already imposed, and thereby undo what former legislation has done; but it is to exhaust the power to assess taxes upon the tonnage of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, and <a id="p39" href="#p39" data-label="39" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*39</a>upon any property now owned or hereafter to be owned by that company, no matter what the value, character, or extent of the property, nor what the exigencies of the government may be.</p>

    <p id="b39-6" data-blocks='[["BL_39.5",39,[193,805,1167,473]]]'>A contrary doctrine would not only tend to weaken, and ultimately to destroy the rightful powers of the General Assembly, but it would also greatly trench upon the inherent power of the people themselves; for, if such a contract can lawfully be made, its obligation will remain, despite legislative enactment or constitutional mandate. The thorough examination which this question has received at the hands of my brethren, dispenses with the necessity of further discussion. But it is said that the complainants, neither as tax-payers, nor as canal commissioners, have such an interest as to justify their complaint being listened to; and it is also alleged that the question is prematurely raised.</p>
    <p id="b39-7" data-blocks='[["BL_39.6",39,[192,1278,1166,1160]],["BL_40.1",40,[310,441,1164,604]]]'>The right of the complainants, both as tax-payers and as canal commissioners, to call in question the constitutional power of the legislature to make the proposed contract, has been sufficiently shown in the opinions just read; and it appears to me to be very plain that the question is not only a material one, but that this is the very time to have it presented and determined. A contract is about to be made upon the faith of an Act of Assembly; and if made, will affect interests of great magnitude. Its execution involves the sale and delivery of property belonging to the Commonwealth of immense value; no part of which can be abandoned, or perverted from its accustomed use, without producing the most injurious consequences. It also involves the creation of a debt, on the part of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, of at least nine million dollars; the incurring of which debt, it is evident, would be induced, in a considerable degree, upon the faith of the release of the taxing power. If the proposed contract is incapable of full execution, and of entire performance by both parties, the plainest principles of common justice require, that it should be so declared before any one has been misled by it. Again, the proposition to sell the right to tax particular property is now made for the first time in the history of Pennsylvania legislation ; and the sooner that it is known that no such contract can be made by either or all of the departments of this government, the better it will be for the parties to this bill, and for every citizen of this Commonwealth. The sooner a question like this is met, the easier it is to dispose of it. There is now no claim of vested rights, nor of abused confidence. A great principle can <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>be vindicated without prejudice to any interest. One department of the government has mistaken its authority; to prevent the ruinous consequences which would certainly follow from acquiescence in the mistake, the power of this court is invoked; and, however great our respect for the immediate representatives of the people, we must pronounce the law as we believe it to be, though by so doing we may declare as unauthorized and void an act of a co-ordinate branch of the government. Nor can we shelter ourselves behind the decisions of the Supreme Court of the United States; for that tribunal is utterly powerless to prevent the mischief here complained of; and to it the people of Pennsylvania have never committed the right to determine, whether their representatives could bargain away one of the most essential powers of government.</p>

The question involves the power of a Pennsylvania legislature under a constitution made by the people of Pennsylvania; and it must be decided by the judicial tribunals of the state of Pennsylvania, upon whom the responsibility of the decision alone rests. It is said that the effect of this injunction will be to lessen competition in bidding for the public property about to be offered for sale. Even were this so, it would not affect the question of the constitutionality of the law under which the sale is proposed to be made; but, instead of lessening competition, the injunction about to be issued will unquestionably promote competition, by placing all who desire to purchase upon an equality.</p>

The effect of the act will then be, that the governor of the Commonwealth may, on the day now fixed, or hereafter to be fixed, sell the entire Main Line of Public Works to any railroad or canal company of this Commonwealth, or to any person or persons, for the highest price bid for the same, not less than seven and a half million of dollars, under the general terms and conditions provided for by the act.
