      <em>“ </em>Residence and cultivation are the elements of a settlement or pre-emption right under the Act of 1786. Residence without cultivation, and cultivation without residence, confer no right. Both were united in the claim of Uriah Leet, whose pre-emption right was undoubted. If that claim did not embrace the whole of the land now claimed by the defendants, it was extended so as to embrace it by his successor, Norman Andrus, who extended and defined the claim originally made by Leet, and conveyed it to Sylvester Beckwith. Up to September 1852, Beckwith was in possession. Not alone by occupying and using the improved land on the premises and cultivating it from year to year, but by having an actual resident settler upon it from the time he purchased, in 1839, till Green, the last actual resident, removed from it. It can make no difference that Green was not technically a tenant and did not pay rent to Beckwith, nor cultivate or crop the land. He was there residing on the land under Beckwith, and Beckwith was farming it; raising large quantities of grain on it, and adding to the improvement. But the judicial construction given to the Act of 1786 requires continuity of actual residence and possession, and that there should not be the smallest cast of abandonment. Abandonment of what ? Not surely of <em>claim, </em>but of <em>residence </em>and <em>cultivation </em>and of the manifest intention of-making the land a place of abode, and the means of supporting a family. This is not necessarily a question of intention. The Supreme Court say it may be, in cases when the claimant is dispossessed or driven off by fire or flood, or forcibly by an intruder, and returns again, or brings his action to recover the possession; but he must return within a reasonable time, or make the effort to get back, if expelled by an intruder — by bringing his action to recover possession in a reasonable time. So, when the claimant is deprived of his possession by the collusion of his tenant with an adverse claimant or disseisor. In all such cases, unless he uses reasonable diligence to continue his actual residence upon the land, as well as his possession for purposes of cultivation, the law regards him as having abandoned and forfeited his right.</p>
    <p id="b406-6" data-blocks='[["BL_406.5",406,[303,1920,1154,385]]]'>“ In this case, the continuity of residence on the premises in controversy was severed in September 1852, by the removal of Green, the last tenant in possession under Beckwith. Beckwith resided upon a small lot of appropriated land within a few rods of the house Green had occupied, and assented to taking it down, and knew of its removal from the premises, and of its being used in building a small house for Green on land owned by Henry Stevens. No person resided on the vacant land from September 1852, the time of Green’s removal, until in September 1856.</p>

After it issued, it was not necessary for them, in order to protect their rights under their settlement claim, if they had any, to build upon the land, and put in a tenant. And the question presented for the determination of the court is, whether the absence of residence on the land from September 1852, until the issuing of their warrant in 1855, constitutes, under the circumstances of the case, an abandonment of the pre-emption claim which Beckwith had to the land, in September 1852, and previously.</p>
    <p id="b407-7" data-blocks='[["BL_407.7",407,[201,932,1159,774]]]'>“We are of opinion that it does, that no good reason can be extracted from the evidence why the continuity of residence was not kept up, or why so long a space of time was permitted to intervene between the going out of Green in 1852 and the obtaining of the warrant by Messrs. Wickham &amp; Tuthill, in 1855, and without having, in the mean time, an actual resident settlement on the land. No doubt Beckwith and Wickham intended to hold this land. They did not intend to abandon their claim to it. They did continue to occupy, and cultivate and obtain profit from it. But that is not what the law requires. They may even have intended, at some time, to build upon and reside on it, but they abandoned the residence too long to be permitted to resume it as against a <em>bond fide </em>claimant by warrant. Such a claimant is not affected by the notice of the title or claim spread on the record, by the deed of Andrus to Beckwith given in evidence, nor by actual possession and cultivation without residence. Under all the facts in this case, plaintiff is entitled to recover, and three is no question of intention to submit to the jury.”</p>

The last of the houses which had been built on the larger tract, and which was occupied by a tenant of Beckwith, was about this time taken down, and rebuilt a short distance from where it formerly stood, but a few feet outside the line of the tract. On the 18th of September 1854, Hoyt procured his warrant, on which the land in controversy was surveyed on the 8th of December thereafter, and returned the 1st February 1854. Under this state of facts, the learned judge ruled that the residence, being discontinued so long — about two years — was an abandonment in law of the settler’s title, and added: “ No doubt Beckwith and Wickham intended to hold the land. They did not intend to abandon their claim to it. They did continue to occupy, and cultivate, and obtain profits from it. But that is not what the law requires. They may even have intended, at some time, to build upon and reside on it, but they abandoned the residence too long to be permitted to resume it against a <em>bond fide </em>claimant by warrant.” Here is a clear and distinct annunciation of the principles upon which the case was <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>ruled, and it is our duty to see how far it is sustainable on authority.</p>

The Act of 1786 defines what shall constitute a settlement, by providing “ that by a settlement shall be understood an actual, personal resident settlement, with a manifest intention of making it a place of abode, and the means of supporting a family, and <em>continued from time to </em>time, unless interrupted by the enemy, or by going into the military service of the country during the war.” A dispensation in favour of soldiers and sufferers from enemies was so meritorious as to be recognised by the statute, and precluded all other inquiry, when established, on the subject of abandonment. But there are “ many other causes of interruption besides those mentioned in the act, which ought to excuse the party for a time at least:” Atchison <em>v. </em>McCulloch, <a href="/watts/5/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="5 Watts 13" data-case-ids="1843967" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0013-01">5 <em>Watts </em>13</a>.

One by the act of the law, to be pronounced by the court on a given state of facts — the other by law and fact together, to be determined by the jury under instructions from the court. The first is forfeiture in the clearest sense, regardless of intention or merit — the last regards both these questions where they exist, and relieves in a proper case from forfeiture. Lapse of time is the usual element that gives vitality to abandonment as a matter of law, while it may be quite an immaterial ingredient in a case where it assumes a mixed character of law and fact; for a settler may, by unequivocal acts and declarations, abandon as effectually by the lapse of a day; nay, of an hour, as he could in a year.</p>

At different periods, different rules seem to have been attempted to be established, as to what length of time should elapse, to raise the conclusive presumption, that the settler had abandoned his settlement. In Cluggage <em>v. </em>Duncan, 1 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>120, it was said, that “ where a man makes a settlement, and leaves it for a great length of time, it does not signify for him to say he keeps up his claim.” Abandonment was ruled in that case as a question of law, but the <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>length of time does not appear, and the period is left indefinite. In Brentlinger <em>v. </em>Hutchinson, <a href="/watts/1/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="1 Watts 46" data-case-ids="1838045" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0046-01">1 <em>Watts </em>46</a>, the abandonment was for a period of sixteen years, and the judgment of the court below was reversed for submitting the <em>animus revertendi </em>as a question of fact for the jury, and Kennedy, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, says, “ Where there is no dispute as to the length of time, it is a question of law, to be decided by the court, without regard to the <em>intention </em>of the party,” and then proceeds to enunciate a rule as to the time when the presumption should become a question of law, by saying, “when the question of abandonment is made upon a lapse of time <em>less than seven years, </em>accompanied by circumstances from which it might be inferred that tlie party <em>intended </em>to abandon, it was a mixed question of fact and law, to be submitted to the decision of the jury;” and yet expressing some doubt as to whether this rule might accord with the legislative will, as evinced in the Act of 1786, he adds, “but still I think it would be sufficient to give quiet and repose to the public, and at the same time afford ample security to the rights of individuals.” This rule was based upon analogy to the 5th section of the Act of 26th March 1786, which limited settlers, out of possession, to that period to bring suit; and also to the presumption of law, that the holder of a warrant, who neglected to have it returned within that period, had abandoned it. The rule resting on kindred analogies, it may now be regretted, that it has not been followed, as in the case of warrant holders. In Atchison <em>v. </em>McCulloch, <a href="/watts/5/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="5 Watts 13" data-case-ids="1843967" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0013-01">5 <em>Watts </em>13</a>, the same judge, in delivering the opinion of the court, when the question arose, as in the last case, on lapse of time, says, “If the plaintiff could in this way prevent the state from disposing of the land for <em>five </em>or <em>six years, </em>he and his heirs might, upon the same plea, and perhaps with truth, too, do it for a century,” and lays down the law clearly that six years raised the legal presumption of abandonment, that being the period of non-residence in that case. Here was a departure from the rule. Each succeeding case seems to have been ruled on its own facts, but the question invariably arose on periods greater than five years.</p>

J. Gibson says: “ When the plaintiff’s warrant was laid, the settlement had been discontinued for <em>at least five years, </em>during Avhich time the settler had done no more than virtually assert his claim to the ownership, and profess his design to resume his residence.” “ It Avas clearly the province of the court, therefore, to direct that he had abandoned his title in point of law.” This case, also abandoning the rule announced in Brentlinger <em>v. </em>Hutchinson, may itself become the foundation, aided, perhaps, by analogies of a neAY rule as to time, of five years for the consummation of the <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>presumption from lapse of time. It is true, that in Wilson <em>v. </em>Watterson, 4 <em>Barr </em>214, and in Heath <em>v. </em>Biddle, 9 <em>Barr </em>273, a latitude seems to he allowed on the subject not easily reconcilable with either the earlier or later cases; and in Sample <em>v. </em>Robb, 4 <em>Harris </em>305, in the opinion delivered by the same learned judge, absence from the premises for nine years was held to belong to that branch of the doctrine properly administrable by a court and jury. But passing these eases by, the case of Jacobs <em>v. </em>Figard, 1 <em>Casey </em>45, opinion by Chief Justice Lewis, determined that five years and nine months raised the presumption of legal abandonment. In the same book, at page 106, is Smith <em>v. </em>Beck, in which there had been non-residence for ten years, and the same learned judge says: “ Where the residence has been discontinued <em>for the period of five years, </em>and the discontinuance is not accounted for, it is an abandonment of the pre-emption right, and should be so pronounced by the court as matter of law. Whether the absence for a shorter period will produce the same effect, has not yet been decided.” But in Goodman <em>v. </em>Lacey, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20326" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 326">3 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>326</a>, it was determined that six months would not, of itself, amount to an abandonment.</p>

    <p id="b411-6" data-blocks='[["BL_411.5",411,[177,1454,1167,939]]]'>The ease of Smith <em>v. </em>Beck seems to recognise five years as the boundary of the doctrine, and it is certainly true, that it has not hitherto been passed, and for my own part, I would prefer fixing it as the rule. But dealing only with the case in hand, the authorities show, I think, very conclusively, that in no case in which the lapse of time was no greater than in the present, has the presumption of abandonment, from this cause alone, been held by the courts. Nor do we think that, as far advanced as we are from the period and the policy that gave rise to the statutes, we are called upon to contract the rule in regard to actual residence more than our predecessors have done. As has been stated, the discontinuance of the actual resident possession in the case under consideration, was but a few days over two years before Hoyt’s warrant issued. This was too short to give to it the character of an abandonment, in law, from lapse of time. The courts therefore, erred in rejecting the evidence offered by the defendants below, for the purpose of proving the <em>animus revertendi. </em>The dereliction of the resident possession, and the intention to resume it, was still open to proof and explanation, if it could be given. Consistently with the ruling in the rejection of the evidence, the learned judge charged that it was a case of legal abandonment, and, for the reasons shown, this was error also.</p>

Nor was there anything in the ground taken on the other side, that the defendants below could not keep up an actual resident possession by a tenant. They could do so : Smith <em>v. </em>Beck, <em>ut supra. </em>Eor the reasons given, the judgment must be reversed.</p>
