By such a sale the landlord’s right is converted into money, which is brought into court as his, and of course he alone is entitled to claim it there.

Legislation never intends to set aside the claims of justice and of right in favour of mere benevolence; and of this we have a quite recent and well known illustration in the exemption law of 1849.

It is the latter that constitutes the lien if there be any. The former does not secure the arrears, while the latter may, and certainly it was intended <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>to prevent arrears. The right of entry is a means of securing the full execution of the consideration of the lease, and may be effectual for the purpose; it is a lien upon or liability of the estate for the duties of the tenure, and this character would be clearly revealed if we should leave it charged upon the estate in hands of sheriff’s vendee.</p>
      <p id="AIn" data-blocks='[["BL_278.3",278,[281,926,1155,241]]]'>There is an apparent difficulty here arising out of a resemblance between this conventional lien and the legal remedy for non-payment of rent provided by the Landlord and Tenant Act, 1830, a resemblance which may seem to require that the rule in Bantleon <em>v. </em>Smith should now be extended to all leases, though it was not noticed in Sands <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 9" data-case-ids="1854638" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0009-01">3 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>9</a>. It is, however, for the present, a sufficient solution of this difficulty, to suggest that to give such an effect to that act would seem to extend it much beyond its intention.</p>
      <p id="AWO" data-blocks='[["BL_278.4",278,[281,1166,1154,136]]]'>We are of opinion that the present case falls precisely within the principle of Bantleon <em>v. </em>Smith, that the right of entry constitutes a lien for the rent in arrear, that the right to exercise it for those arrears was taken away by the sheriff’s sale, and that the lessors are entitled to share in the distribution.</p>

The miners are the first claimants against the whole fund of these three classes of property. As the whole is liable to the miners, and each class is differently liable to other conditions, the payment to the miners must reduce each class proportionably. Then there will remain for distribution of the proceeds of the leasehold, $1196.33 ; of the personal chattels liable to distress, $1266.53 ; and of those not so liable, $1266.50.</p>
