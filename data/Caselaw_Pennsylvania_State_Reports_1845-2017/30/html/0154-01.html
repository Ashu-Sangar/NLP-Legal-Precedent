The law is complied with when the board of trustees is so provided for that it must necessarily consist, in its majority, of laymen who are elected by the lay members of the church, and when the charter follows the words of the act, in requiring that the property shall vest in such a board of trustees.</p>

It ought to be all written on a single sheet of paper, where a society cannot afford parchment for a document of such essential and permanent importance to their corporate existence and guidance. When such a one as this once parts from our possession, we can have no mode of securing the threads that connect the parts with our certificate and seal.</p>
