Seaver against William H. Blair and Thomas H. Hutton, trading as Blair &amp; Hutton. Seaver was a salesman in the employ of the defendants, <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>tea merchants, and claimed compensation for his services for one year. The defendants were the successors of Russel &amp; Blair, having purchased the interest of Russel. The plaintiff, on the trial, called Hugh J. Smith, the defendants’ book-keeper, and proved that Blair told the witness to make out the plaintiff’s account, and to ascertain the amount of sales on the old and the new stock, and to allow Seaver 10 per cent, on the net profits after all bad debts and expenses were deducted. Smith made out the account, and Seaver took a copy of it, the original of which was produced by the witness and given in evidence by the plaintiff. From this account it appeared the plaintiff was entitled to $1455.90, which he acknowledged to have received. In this account the old stock of Russel &amp; Blair was put down at $91,900.96, cost price.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b275-6" data-blocks='[["BL_275.5",275,[213,981,1165,341]]]'>The plaintiff then called Lewis Cooper, the executor of Francis Russel, to proile that they only paid for Russel’s moiety of the old stock $40,000. On that account they contended that stock should have been computed at $80,000, instead of the sum at which Blair &amp; Hutton set it down, and to show an error in the account, and larger profits than the account made out by them exhibited. The defendants objected to this testimony, but the court admitted it; and this is one of the errors complained of.</p>

The witness was sworn, but before being examined, was objected to on the ground that he did not believe in a future state of rewards and punishments; and a .witness was called who testified that in the summer of 1853 Sharp had told him “ that the violation of the Sabbath, and what the world called religious, would not interfere with his filture. He said he did not believe the Bible to be the inspired work of God, and it laid down rules which did not bind him.”</p>

There was no direct evidence upon the subject; an inference could be drawn from the testimony of Hugh J. Smith that Seaver was to receive ten per cent, on the nett amount of profits, for his services as clerk. Assuming that the jury would find from the evidence that he was to receive a portion of the actual profits, the evidence of Cooper was clearly admissible, as its direct tendency was to establish what the profits were. Consequently it was the duty of the court to receive this evidence, for to have rejected it would have been a determination of the measure of compensation by the court. As this was a question of fact, the court was bound to submit it to the jury.</p>
