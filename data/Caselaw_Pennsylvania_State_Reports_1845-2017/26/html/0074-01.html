Bowers died in 1851, intestate, being indebted to the plaintiff, who was his father, by two promissory notes, amounting to the sum of |657.37. The defendant agreed, if the plaintiff would renounce his right to letters of administration on the estate of Romulus J. Bowers, and permit and procure the same to be issued to the defendant, he would assume and pay the amount of the notes plaintiff held against the estate. The plaintiff accordingly filed his renunciation, and letters of administration were in due form of law issued to the defendant.</p>

After argument the court below (Hare, J.) delivered the. following opinion and arrested the judgment:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="AT0" data-blocks='[["BL_75.7",75,[170,1140,1172,1288]],["BL_76.1",76,[336,421,1164,127]]]'>“ The question raised by this motion is one of very considerable intrinsic difficulty, increased by the absence of all conclusive or determining authority, which we have been able to find either in the argument at the bar, or by our own researches. It cannot be denied that the widow and father of the intestate had a claim to the administration of his estate, which might, and probably would have been listened to by the register, had they not been induced to renounce it by the expectations held out by the defendant. Courts of justice do not weigh the adequacy of eonsiderations, unless as a means of detecting or preventing fraud, and a smaller sacrifice than that made by the plaintiff, has been held to give force to graver obligations than those assumed by the defendant. But although there may be no want of consideration for this promise, there is an 'objection of a more serious nature. To sustain this action, we must hold that the office of administering an estate, which is a place- of trust and confidence, may be made a matter of traffic and sale among those who have pretensions to exercise it; and as no contract can be binding, unless its obligation is mutual, it must necessarily follow that if the administrator can lose money by such a bargain, he may make it, and may stipulate with a creditor or legatee to take less than his demand, as the condition on which he will give his time and services. The law has defined the duties and liabilities of administrators with great exactitude, and we do not think the parties entitled either to increase or diminish them. Both duty and liability are limited to the collection of the assets of the estate, and their faithful appropriation to the discharge of its obligations. Nothing less than this will be permitted, and nothing more should be imposed or required. An administrator is not bound by the most direct personal promise to pay a debt or legacy after ad<a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>ministration has been granted, unless he has assets, and the substantial, if not the technical reason of the case, is the same before he enters on the duties of his office, as it is afterwards.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b76-6" data-blocks='[["BL_76.5",76,[331,551,1176,945]]]'>“But, even if this promise would have been legally binding in England, it does not follow that it will be so in Pennsylvania. Oiir jurisprudence is enriched with whatever equity has added to the original stores of the common law. The administration of an estate is strictly a trust. A trust can make no adverse bargain by anticipation or otherwise with a <em>cestui que trust. </em>Can a <em>cestui que trust </em>enforce a hostile contract against a trustee ? The conduct of trusts will be attended with risks, which few men will like to encounter, if every expression by trustees of hope or anticipation, as to the solvency of the estate, if committed to their management, can be brought before a jury, as evidence of a promise binding their whole estate to the payment of debts to which 'they are strangers. The statute of frauds provided that no action should be brought against an executor or administrator, upon a promise to answer in damages out of his own estate, unless the agreement or a memorandum of it were in writing, and thus guarded against the danger and uncertainty of testimony by. requiring irrefragable proof both of the consideration and the promise. Were this provision in force here, or were it not in force in the other states of this country and in England, we should have been spared the necessity of deciding this case, or should have been guided by the light of precedent in deciding it.</p>

I call it an <em>office, </em>not because it is so strictly, but because it very much resembles one, and is frequently so called in the books. An office is a right to exercise a public or private employment, and to take the fees and emoluments thereunto belonging. An administrator is appointed by a public officer, under his seal of office, to exercise a trust and perform duties which are carefully defined by law, and which affect both public and private interests, and his compensation is measured by legal standards, though not defined in the fee bill. In Beck <em>v. </em>Stitzel, 9 <em>Harris </em>522, it was held that words were actionable without proof of special damage, which imputed to an administrator <em>“ </em>a positive and fraudulent breach of his <em>official </em>oath.” If public policy forbids traffic in the office of postmaster, as was decided in Filson’s Trustees <em>v. </em>Himes, 5 <em>Barr </em>456, it will, for superior reasons, interdict barter in respect to the more sacred trust of administration.</p>

The administration would nevertheless be effectual <a id="p78" href="#p78" data-label="78" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*78</a>and valid. But, by agreeing to pay George the full amount of his debts, without regard to the sufficiency of the assets, William made a contract that was prejudicial to other creditors, for he bound himself so to administer the estate-as to indemnify himself. If all the debts could not be fully paid, he had a separate or peculiar interest that this one'should be, and thus he placed himself in possible antagonism to those whose interests he was bound to represent and guard. ■ A mere creditor administrator has an interest that his debt should be fully paid, but he has contracted for no preference over others. His interest is common with them, and the nearer he can bring the assets to full payment the better for them.</p>
