There must be such a delivery and change of possession attending the transfer, as the nature of the property is capable of; otherwise the law pronounces the sale fraudulent as against creditors and <em>bona fide </em>purchasers. A large quantity of lumber piled up in a mill yard is not susceptible of the same delivery that can he made of a horse. The purchaser should take the delivery of the former by counting or ascertaining its quantity, and by marking it conspicuously with his name, and by reducing it into his actual possession by removal, at as early a period as, from the nature of the property, it can reasonably be done. If he fail to do this, the law deems the sale fraudulent, and the property would be liable to an execution against the vendor, at any time before it was reduced into the <em>actual and exelu~ ■sive </em>possession of the vendee. We must look to the situation of this property at the time the execution of Haynes attached, and see if all had been done that the law requires to perfect and validate the sale. Wheeler is uncertain as to the period that elapsed between the bargain at the house and the time when the delivery was made, and the lumber marked. He says about three weeks or less. Gibbs is much more definite. He says the talk took place at the house about the 18th or 20th of-February; that before the bargain was concluded the parties went to the mill, and ascertained the quantity by counting the courses; that the horse was then delivered to Miller in part payment, the plaintiff agreeing to pay the $100 in money the next week; that this sum was so paid by the witness for the plaintiff on the 2oth, and a receipt taken therefor; at which time witnesses were called to the formal <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>delivery of the lumber, and the plaintiff’s name plainly written upon <em>the </em>several piles. This took place before Haynes issued his execution, and, if the evidence of Gibbs is believed, with the full knowledge of Haynes himself. Although the terms of sale may have been agreed upon at Miller’s house, yet if the jury believe that, on the same day, and in pursuance of their bargain, the parties went and saw the lumber, ascertained its quantity, and-that, on the'receipt by Miller of his pay in full, witnesses were called to the delivery, and the plaintiff’s name conspicuously marked on the several piles, this would be in law a good delivery of the possession, provided, however, it was followed by the actual removal by the plaintiff of the lumber, at as early a period as' he reasonably could, without a sacrifice of the whole, or a considera- • ble part of its value. Ulster is the point on the river where this lumber was to be drawn for rafting, a distance of 18 miles from the mill. According to the evidence, within two or three days after it was paid for and delivered, the snow went off, and the roads became broken up, and nearly or quite impassable for heavy loads, and so continued until after the lumber was levied upon; that teams could not be employed to haul, and that it would have cost as much, or more than the lumber was worth to have hauled' it. If the jury believe this, the plaintiff was not bound to haul, the lumber at such a sacrifice, but might wait until he could do so at a reasonable cost; and that the leaving of the lumber in the mill yard, up to the time of the levy upon it, under such circumstances, would not in law make the sale fraudulent and void, and subject the property to levy and sale on an execution against Miller.”</p>
