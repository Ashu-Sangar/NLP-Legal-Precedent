Erick, defendant, and Samuel Baugh, Executor of Thomas C. Brown, deceased, and others, garnishees. On the 2d February, 1852, A. R. Chambers recovered judgment against the defendant, Brick, for $3035.95, and on the 7th July, 1853, issued this attachment. Thomas C. Brown, the garnishee’s testator, died insolvent, and indebted to Brick in the sum of $2500. Baugh having filed his accounts of the estate of Brown, they were referred to an auditor, on the 17th June, 1853, to make distribution among the creditors. The report of the auditor was filed on the 7th October, 1853, and confirmed on the 21st of the same month.</p>

Chambers, in consideration, as was alleged, of $100, and a debt which Brick owed him. David M. Chambers appeared before the auditor, and claimed the share of the estate coming to Brick, and the auditor awarded to him in his report the sum of $641.16.</p>

Under these acts it has been held that no <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>such interest can be attached until the accounts are settled: until after a decree of distribution; 7 <em>Barr </em>485, 10 <em>Barr </em>419.
