That the borough of Bristol was incorporated in the year 1720, by letters patent, and that the charter was amended by an act of the General Assembly, passed in the year 1851, and further amended by another act passed on the 18th day of April, 1853. That under the supposed and pretended authority of the last-mentioned act, the burgess and council of the borough did, on the 26th day of May, 1855, pass a certain ordinance, by which it was enacted, among other things, that Dorrance street, fifty feet in width, shall be and is hereby laid out and extended through land of Sarah Keen, to Radcliff street,” &amp;c.</p>

The motion now before us is for a preliminary injunction; and all that is necessary for us to say at this stage of the case is, that the argument has failed to convince us that the act of 18th February, 1858, which authorizes the burgess and town council of the borough of Bristol to lay out and construct streets in said borough, is unconstitutional.</p>
    <p id="b47-14" data-blocks='[["BL_47.15",47,[162,2340,1159,86]],["BL_48.1",48,[337,417,1168,729]]]'>Ordinarily the power of taxation which is given to municipal corporations is adequate security to the citizen for his property <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>which may be taken in opening streets for public use. No other security need be required in the act of the General Assembly giving the corporate authorities power to open streets. Where, however, it is clearly shown that the power of taxation is inadequate within a reasonable time to pay the damages likely to be occasioned, we have no doubt that it is the right and duty of this court to interfere, when properly called upon, and prevent the property from being taken or the damages from being done, until adequate security is given. The present is a case which requires such interference. The power of taxation in the borough of Bristol is so limited that the amount of damages likely to be occasioned to the complainant’s land in all probability could not be paid out of the public treasury of said borough within any reasonable time. To make the complainant perfectly safe, we will not allow the street to be opened through her lands, until the bond of the borough with one sufficient surety in the penal sum of five thousand dollars be given, as mentioned in the annexed'</p>
