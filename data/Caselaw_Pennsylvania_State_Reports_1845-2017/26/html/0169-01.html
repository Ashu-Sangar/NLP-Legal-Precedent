That the words “give” and “given,” employed by the statute in defining the offence not laid, are found in the indictment, is of no moment, for if they be construed to mean a <em>delivery </em>of the liquor sold, which they may he without violence to language, they become appropriate terms in defining the offence intended to be charged. Appropriate or superfluous, however, they do not produce duplicity, for the gift of liquor to be an offence must be in “ <em>connexion with some other business or profitable </em>employment,” and this is not laid in the indictment. The offence charged is a sale and delivery of liquors without license, and that is a single and well defined charge. Perceiving no error in the record, the judgment is affirmed.</p>
