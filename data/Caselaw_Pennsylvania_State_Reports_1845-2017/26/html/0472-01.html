On the 9th of December, 1852, the order issued; on the 21st of the same month the order was continued; and at April Sessions, 1853, the report was made, and the road ordered to be opened. On the 18th of February, 1854, the report was read a second time, and that part of the report laying out the new road confirmed, and that part vacating the old road not approved. The order to open issued March the 8th, 1854.</p>

L. R. </em>441</a>, we decided in 1853 that this act means what it says, and that if, for any sufficient reason, the report cannot be made at the next term, the proper course is to apply to the court to continue the order, and to make it returnable to the next succeeding term.</p>
    <p id="b472-14" data-blocks='[["BL_472.17",472,[294,2195,1165,216]],["BL_473.1",473,[202,398,1172,80]]]'>In this case, the viewers were appointed at the June Sessions of 1852, to report to the October Sessions, but no report was made. At December Sessions a continuance was entered and a new viewer appointed. The next term was March, 1853, at which there was no report, but an Act of Assembly having provided <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>for a term in April, the report came in at the sessions of that month.</p>
    <p id="b473-6" data-blocks='[["BL_473.5",473,[204,485,1170,464]]]'>Against such a practice there stands the Act of Assembly and the decision of this court, cited above. What is urged in favour of it ? Simply that the plaintiff in error did not except in the court below, and for this two cases are relied on (5 <em>Harris </em>117, and 6 <em>Harris </em>239), neither of which involved the present question. There are certain expressions in the opinions in those cases which are to be taken with a qualification. When it is said that <em>all </em>irregularities and errors to which exceptions are not taken in the Quarter Sessions will be considered as waived, the court must be understood as excepting such as appear on the face of the record.</p>

If we say he should have complained below, he may answer as this plaintiff in error did, that he had no notice of the proceeding until it was too late. But if he answer not at all, or if he say he chose to rely on his writ of error, which is a writ of right, I see not how he is to be denied the justice he demands.</p>
