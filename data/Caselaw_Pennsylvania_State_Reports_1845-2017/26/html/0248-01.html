The claim filed set out that it was for “the sum of $440, against all that certain three-story brick building, and the lot or piece of ground whereon the same is erected, situate,” &amp;c., “ the said sum of $440 being the balance of the sum of $1000, being the contract price ■for the erection and construction of said building, and the materials •furnished for the same, within six months last past, to wit, from the 1st of July, 1851, to the 1st of October, 1852, for and about the erection and construction of the said herein described building and appurtenances,” &amp;c. This lien was filed on the 8th November, 1852.</p>
