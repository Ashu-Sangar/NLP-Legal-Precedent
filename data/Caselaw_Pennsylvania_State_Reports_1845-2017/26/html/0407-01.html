The parties own adjoining lands, and some 30 or 40 rods above the dividing line is a strong spring on thé land of the plaintiffs, the natural outlet of which is in the direction of the defendant’s land. This outlet having rising ground on both sides of it, serves to carry off not only, the water of this spring, but also the water from rain and snow which fall on some-600 acres of land, property of the plaintiff and others. At a very early period in the history of Berks county, a public road was laid out across the outlet, near the spring, with a small bridge, composed of logs and plank, over the outlet, leaving a waterway underneath. The bridge was repaired from time to time, and the passage under it cleared of rubbish, and finally a plank trunk was put in to conduct the water under the bridge. Some few years since the public road was vacated, and then the father of the plaintiffs took out the trunk and opened a passage for the water. Some witnesses speak of the spring as a natural pond, covering half an acre of ground, and others say that formerly they mowed grass growing where the pond has been known of late years. Whether it was a reservoir by nature, or made so by the embankments of the public road, and the partial obstruction of the outlet, is not an ascertained fact in the case.- The attention of the jury was not directed to it, and no point was, submitted on the subject which enables us to infer how they may have regarded it.</p>

There was evidence that made it the duty of the court to submit this question, and which justified the jury in finding as they did; but it is complained of on the part of the plaintiffs, that in determining the customary flow, the court did not direct the attention of the jury to the state of the ground before the old road was built.</p>
    <p id="b412-6" data-blocks='[["BL_412.5",412,[327,756,1169,1021]]]'>Doubtless the ancestor of the plaintiffs had a right, after vacation of the old road, to remove it altogether, and restore the premises to the state they Avere in before the road was built. If '-the effect of exercising this right was to give the water its original, but long-suspended flowage, and thereby cause it to penetrate the defendant’s land, Avhich, during the partial obstruction of the road, it had failed to reach, it was a very important conclusion of fact, and should have been ascertained and established. But if plaintiff’s counsel thought there was evidence to establish it, they doubtless presented it in argument to the jury, and if they wished the court to charge upon it, they should have called on them by an appropriate point to do so. It is not error for a court to omit to charge on every possible aspect of the facts, especially when uninvited by the party complaining. So far as the judge dealt with the facts, he presented them fairly. The Avitnesses, to Avhose testimony he referred, spoke of the flow of the water as they had known it. If their memories were not older than the road, this was not their fault, and it was no reason why the court should withhold their testimony from the jury. If there was evidence that proved a different state of waters before the road was built, the court said nothing to damage the effect of it, and the plaintiffs had the benefit of it; but not having invoked judicial comment upon it, they have no reason to complain that judicial comment was withheld.</p>

Most certainly he did not, for the court told the jury that “ to prevent the waters of floods and freshets flowing where they were accustomed to flow, the defendant could have no right. Any obstruction to any such waters would give the plaintiffs the right of action.” Was this sod dam an obstruction of any such waters ?

This perhaps accounts for the fact that the water only of floods and freshets reached Griesemer’s land. Whether the ordinary flow wasted itself by absorption and evaporation, or was consumed in irrigation of the 50 acres of plaintiffs’ meadow, it did not visit the .defendant’s land, and from the topography of the place, it was physically impossible that it should. But to compel it to go there, a ditch was dug, which, according to one witness, extended at least 12 feet into Griesemer’s land. Finding that the water thus introduced was injurious to his crops, Griesemer built the sod dam across the ditch at the line fence, and this is the wrong complained of.</p>

It is not however to be understood, he goes on still further to say, that because the flow of water must not be caused by the act of man, that therefore the proprietor who transmits water to the inferior heritage, is not permitted to do anything on his own land — that he is condemned to abandon it to perpetual sterility, or never vary the course of cultivation, simply because such acts would produce some change in the manner of discharging the water.

If, from the natural disposition of the place, a basin was formed on the plaintiffs’ land, some 17 rods short of the defendant’s, from which the water flowed upon the defendant only in time of floods or freshets, the defendant was the superior owner in respect of that place in all ordinary times, and it would be a reversal of the principles stated to subject him, against his consent, to an artificial channel that would deprive him of the advantages of his position.

The sod dam, if indeed it ever had a substantive existence, of which the counsel on neither side were able to convince themselves, was in this view of the case, an innocent and lawful erection. It was not setting up a nuisance against a nuisance, any more than the shutting the door against an unwelcome visiter is a nuisance. The only servitude the plaintiffs could claim in the defendant’s land was that it should receiye the overflow which was natural and customary, and the court throughout their charge guarded this right. There was no invasion of it by'the defendant, and he was not, therefore, liable in damages.

The land of both, though now within the corporate limits of the borough of Manchester, consists of out lots of the town of Allegheny, and is occupied by them as farming, or rather as gardening land.

This had got choked up from neglect, and the authorities of Manchester, at the instance of the plaintiff and others, had built a new culvert'in its place. After this the amount of water flowing through said channel was greatly increased in time of storms by means of a road cut into the hill by an adjoining proprie tor (a cemetery .company), which collected into one drain, and thence into this channel, large quantities of water which had been previously dischai’ged in a natural way over a large surface. This increase of water did great injury to the defendant, and to protect himself therefrom, he stopped up the culvert, and thus threw the water back upon the road, on the plaintiff’s side of it, overflowed his land, and interfered with his garden operations.</p>

It is a right, in the enjoyment of which a reasonable regard must always be had to the rights of others. On the other hand — as are our rights, so are our duties. We claim the use of running waters according to the order of nature where it is for our benefit, and the same order requires us to bear the inconvenience of them when they are injurious.</p>

If the defendant has, by the erection of any obstruction, thrown thorn back upon the plaintiff to his injury, the latter has a right to recover; and the defendant cannot excuse himself on the ground that the owners above him have increased the flow of water to that point so as to make it injurious to him. He cannot, by stopping the channel, visit their sins upon the plaintiff. For the injury done to him by others he must seek redress against them: <em>Corp. Jur. Civ. Dig. </em>39, 3, 1, 18. If you are not able to say whether the injury arose from the act of the plaintiff in giving his drains an improper direction, or from the wrongful act of the defendant, of course you will find for the defendant.</p>

They are in general the same as in the case of running water — they follow nature. Not readily finding the subject treated of in any of our usual books of reference, I venture to extract the law from books of a foreign <em>origin </em>— Corp. <em>Jur. Civ. </em>39, 3, 1, and 43, 21; <em>Code Nap. </em>sec. 640; <em>Poth. du Voisinage. </em>It is so simple in its character that we are little likely to be led astray by any modification of it arising from peculiar institutions.</p>

The inconvenience arises from its position, and is usually more than compensated by other circumstances. Hence the owner of the lower ground has no right to erect embankments whereby the natural flow of the water from the upper ground shall be stopped; nor has the owner of the upper ground a right to make any excavations or drains by which the flow of water is directed from its natural channel, and a new channel made on the lower ground; nor can he collect into one channel waters usually flowing off into his neighbour’s fields by several channels, and thus increase the wash upon the lower fields.</p>

And as he may use running streams to irrigate his lands, even though he does thereby, not unreasonably, diminish the supply of his neighbour, so also he may use proper means of draining his ground where it is too moist, and discharge the water according to the natural channel, even though the flow of water upon his neighbour be thereby somewhat increased.</p>

So in this case, it is manifest that the cemetery company had no right to collect into one place and discharge upon the defendant’s ground, the water falling upon the whole surface of the hill, and which before had discharged itself .in many directions. If he could stop it without injury to any but the cemetery company, he had a right to do it, but he cannot do it to the injury of the plaintiff.</p>

A road is a way for travel, not for water; and it would be ruinous to our public roads if each adjoining proprietor could insist upon discharging the drainage of his land upon them, or preventing the roads from being drained upon his land. Roads are made for the convenience of travel, and in no sense to relieve land bordering upon them fx-om the burdens to which they are natoally subservient. When there is a natural channel or hollow for discharging the now of water, it must be suffered to remain until altered by agreement of those concerned, and the water cannot be turned upon the road until the proper authorities have provided means’ of carrying it away. <em>Corp.
