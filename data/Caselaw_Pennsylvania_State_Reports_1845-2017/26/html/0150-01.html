A guaranty is a contract, and as to its general requisites stands upon the same footing as other contracts. A contract is an agreement between competent parties upon a sufficient consideration to do an act allowed by the municipal law, and in a guaranty all these must be found. There must be the consent of both parties, an offer on one side and its acceptance by the other, and of this consent you must have proper evidence. In the English system the contract of guaranty is by statute required to be in writing, and when reduced to writing, the language is construed most strongly against the guarantor. In Pennsylvania a guaranty need not be in writing, but as a protection against fraud the evidence of the promise of guaranty is to be clear and explicit, that there may be no room to suspect mistake or any unfairness in the transaction: Petriken <em>v. </em>Baldy, 7 <em>W. Ser. </em>430. The usual mode of making a. guaranty of a future credit is, that the guarantor offers (makes a pollicitation) to guaranty; and when the offer is accepted and goods sold on the faith of it, the merchant selling the goods gives notice of the acceptance. The guarantor is entitled to this notice, unless indeed the agreement to accept be simultaneous with the offer: Kay <em>v. </em>Allen, 9 <em>Barr </em>320. Notice is merely one of the steps required to complete a guaranty. If the parties complete the contract, the one by offering and the other by accepting the offer, and all in the same conversation, no further notice is required. For in a guaranty, as in every other contract resting in stipulation, the concurrence of consenting minds creates the obligation, such consent being once established need not be repeated. In the present case the parties met at Boas’ tavern in Easton, and the plaintiff alleges that the guaranty was there made; an offer on one side, its acceptance on the other, and a communication of that acceptance to Unangst; all this the plaintiff alleges took place there at that time. No subsequent notice of acceptance is pretended. This raises for you the question, <em>‘Do you believe from the evidence that XJnangst, at Boas’ tavern, offered to guaranty Wenner to an indefinite amount, or to the amount of </em>$10,000, <em>or less, and that this offer was accepted at that time by Hibler through his properly authorized agent, Snyder V </em>(The attention of the jury is directed to each term of this question.) You will not confound Snyder’s subsequent actions in the ease with the contract as evidenced at the time of its alleged completion at Boas’. The evidence of the contract (if one were made) are the facts that occurred at that time and place. <em>The evidence that Unangst made an offer to guaranty, or that his offer -was accepted at the time, is slight. </em>But it is for your consideration — you will interpret all <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>the symbols. <em>The question whether Snyder had authority as agent of Hibler to malee a contract of guaranty, and whether the merchandise </em>(the liquor) <em>was delivered to Wenner, are also for your consideration. </em>If you find that Snyder had such authority, that the merchandise was delivered to Wenner and that there was a contract to guaranty consummated at Boas’, your verdict will be for the plaintiff, otherwise for the defendant. You are the judges of the credibility of the witnesses.”</p>

In such a case the law is well settled, that the evidence of the promise must be “ clear and explicit, that there should be no room to suspect mistake, misapprehension, or any unfairness in the transaction:” Petriken <em>v. </em>Baldy, 7 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>430. “ It is the duty of the individual who contracts with one man on the credit of another, not to trust to ambiguous phrases and strained constructions, but to require an explicit and plain declaration of the obligations he is about to assume:” Russell <em>v. </em>Clark’s Executor, <a href="/us/11/0069-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="7 Cranch 69" data-case-ids="572728" data-case-paths="/us/11/0069-01">7 <em>Cranch </em>69</a>.

In this case the evidence relied on comes from the plaintiff’s agent. It is not likely to lose anything material to the plaintiff as it passes through such a channel. The witness, told Unangst that he “ was selling for Hibler, and would not like to sell (to George Wenner) unless he made a <em>Iona fide </em>one — to be safe, you know.” Unangst observed, “if George Wenner is not good enough, I am.” The witness then replied, “ Yes, for $10,000, if you requested it.” But Unangst, although thus invited to make the request, did not do so. He said nothing more on the subject. He merely “smiled,” and afterwards asked the witness to take a drink. In this there is no “clear and explicit” contract to be liable for the goods to be furnished to Wenner — no “ explicit and plain declaration of the obligation.” There was no agreement between the parties at all. There was no acceptance of any offer of guaranty — no amount fixed by the parties, nor was there any subsequent notice of the amount furnished on the credit of the alleged guaranty. There was no evidence to justify the court in submitting to the jury the question of guaranty. Taking all that the witness stated to be true, it amounted to nothing like a contract between the parties. The court ought to have instructed the <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>jury that the plaintiff, under the evidence, was not entitled to recover.</p>
