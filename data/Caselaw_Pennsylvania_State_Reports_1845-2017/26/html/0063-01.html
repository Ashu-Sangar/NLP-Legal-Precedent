William Abbott, after obtaining this judgment against Coates, had failed in business, and on the 19th of March, 1841, had entered into an agreement with his creditors, the tenor of which was that inasmuch as it was “hoped and believed by himself and his creditors <em>that if his property was managed and disposed of hy his own </em>agency, it might pay his creditors in full and leave a surplus for himself and family,” the creditors.agreed with Abbott that he should make a general assignments all his property to Howard Yardley, in trust to convey the same to Gideon Scull, Benjamin Jones, Jr., and William Abbott, (the assignor), in trust to sell and dispose of the same <em>from and after one year from the date of the </em>assignment or sooner with the consent of the said Wil<a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>liam Abbott; and, after paying all expenses of the said trust and all liens on the property assigned, to distribute the proceeds rate-ably among Abbott’s creditors; and it was further stipulated in the agreement as follows: “ and among the expenses of said trust shall be included a commission to the said William Abbott, <em>who will act as the agent of the said assignees, but in Ms own name and wholly at the risk of the assigned estate, </em>not exceeding fifteen hundred dollars per annum, to be taken for the support of himself and family at a rate not exceeding one hundred and twenty-five dollars a month for the,year allowed to wind up the personal effects.” Abbott’s agreement with his creditors was followed by the assignment made to Yardley in pursuance of it, whereby he conveyed all his property to Yardley, together with “all the powers, rights, and authorities, to them the said Gideon Scull, Benj. Jones, Jr., and William Abbott, jointly, <em>or to him the said William Abbott separately, </em>expressed in the above recited articles of agreement.” Yardley then conveyed to Scull, Jones, and Abbott, reciting fully the agreement of the creditors with Abbott and the assignment from Abbott to Yardley. The agreement of Abbott with his creditors was never recorded, and his assignees have never filed any inventory or appraisement, or given bond for the faithful performance of their duties.</p>

In 1842 he filed in his own name an account of his management of the business. Subsequently, an account was filed in the names of all three of the assignees, and the auditor of that account, in' allowing the $1500 secured to Abbott by the assignment, reported the fact that “ the other trustees had incurred little responsibility,- and had a very limited share in the troubles and details of the business.”</p>

Abbott, assigned this judgment to him, executing the assignment in his own name and in the names of his co-assignees, for whom he professed to have authority to act. He also, at the same time, delivered to Mr. Butler the original judgment-bond of Coates on which the judgment had been entered, and gave him an order on the prothonotary to mark the judgment to the use of E. H. Butler, which order was also signed by Abbott in his own name and the names of his co-assignees.</p>

Mr. Butler afterwards filed his account in the Court of Common Pleas, which was referred to an auditor for adjustment and distribution. On the hearing before the auditor, Mr. Butler, as the owner of the judgment of Abbott <em>v. </em>Coates, which he had purchased in good faith and for a valuable consideration, claimed to be allowed his <em>pro rata </em>share of the fund. This was resisted by Scull, Jones, and Abbott (Abbott’s assignees), upon the ground that Abbott had no authority to sell the judgment, and they claimed the dividend for themselves. The auditor disallowed Mr. Butler’s claim, sustained the position taken by Abbott’s assignees, and awarded the dividend to them. Mr. Butler filed exceptions. The court below confirmed the report of the auditor, and decreed the dividend to Abbott’s assignees. Thereupon Mr. Butler took this appeal.</p>

If one party intended to make $600, and the other $2500, by the bargain, their offences against good morals are equal in principle, although differing in degree. But we have no evidence to show that either party had any knowledge which would make it against conscience to enter into the bargain. However that may be, it is clear that there is no evidence to invalidate the contract in a court of justice. Butler made the purchase before he was appointed a trustee, and he had as good a right to make it as any other stranger. The only question discussed is whether Wm. Abbott had authority to make the transfer? It is conceded that if the transfer to Howard Yardley and by him to Gideon Scull, Benjamin Jones, and William Abbott are invalid, Abbott’s sale of the judgment is perfectly free from objection. In that case he stood as the owner with full right to sell it for the best price he could obtain. But if the transfers are valid and effective (which we neither affirm nor deny), what powers did they give to Abbott ? It is evident that the chief object of Abbott’s assignment to Yardley, and Yardley’s assignment to Scull, Jones, and Abbott, was to continue Abbott in possession, as before the assignment, with full power to manage and dispose of the property as agent of the assignees. The latter were authorized by the instrument to sell the personal estate “absolutely,” and the real estate “in fee simple,” after the expiration of one year from the date of the assignment. During the year previous to the general sale of the property, it was expected that Abbott would have to pay close attention to the business, to manage the property to the best advantage, and for this he was allowed $1500. But, after the expiration of the year, the assignees had full power to sell the real and personal estate, and William Abbott had full power to “ act as their agent in his own <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>name, at the risk of the assigned estate.” There was no limit to Abbott’s authority as agent. It was by the terms of the assignment co-extensive with the powers of his principals. As they had an absolute power to sell, so had he. With these ample powers, he received a valuable consideration from Butler for the judgment against Coates; and, not only in his own name, but in the names of the assignees, he transferred .the judgment to Butler. This transfer passed the title to Butler. If there was anything improvident in the bargain, let the creditors blame themselves for the folly of assenting to such an arrangement, or let them look to their agent for indemnity. Butler is not to be injured by taking them at their word and dealing with the person appointed by them to transact the business. They have, through their agent Abbott, received Butler’s money. If the purchase had turned out an unprofitable one, the loss would have fallen upon him. As it has turned out a valuable investment, it is just that he should have the benefit of it.</p>
