If it is void by way of executory devise, and creates merely an estate tail in Acksah Quintan, the first taker, then she having died without issue, the property would revert to Robert Scott’s heirs, and the plaintiff would only recover her share as one of them. The solution of this inquiry depends on whether an indefinite failure of issue is meant, or a definite failure, — that is, a failure within a life or lives in being and 21 years after; if the first, it is an estate tail in the first taker. If the second, it is a good executory devise, and the limitation over to Eliza Scott, the plaintiff, would take effect.</p>

The farm and the $650 are coupled together, in the limitation over, showing, as I think, that it was in the testator’s mind that both should take effect at the same time. But it is expressly provided that the money is to go to plaintiff, ‘ if not received by my said daughter Acksah in her lifetime;’ and the farm is to go over ‘together ;with’ the $650. The language of both the codicils confirms this view, as showing what was the general intent of the testator as to the time when the limitations over of the property given conditionally to Acksah, should take effect. In them he plainly indicates the time of her death as the period in his mind for the occurrence of the contingency. Although not decisive of the particular intent in the clause in question, they throw light upon it. We search out the intent of the testator as we can gather it from the four corners of the will; for, if legal, it will and ought to govern. Regarding this devising clause, then, as a good executory devise; it follows that the whole title and right of recovery, whatever you may find to be its extent, is .in the plaintiff, so as to entitle her, <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>if she recovers at all, to recover an entirety, and not-an undivided purpart.” • •</p>
