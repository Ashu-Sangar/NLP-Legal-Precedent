The possibility of converting small sums into coin in Philadelphia, whether through the action of banks or brokers, without loss to the holder, is no <em>certain </em>criterion, as that may be done through a spirit of accommodation-; but the ability to raise gold and silver coin for sums to any amount likely to come into the possession of any dealer or bank in the city, without loss or discount, would be strong and cogent evidence that the paper was at <em>par. </em>You have a right to hear the combined or separate opinions of merchants, bankers, and brokers; in short, of all men dealing in, or making use of, bank paper, and from their whole statements make up your opinions as to whether the paper of the Harrisburg Bank was or was not equal to gold and silver coin in the city of Philadelphia, for all purposes for which paper of the banks of that city can be ordinarily used. If it was, it may be said to have been at <em>par. </em>If it could not be converted into coin without loss to the holder, so as in his hands to be equal to any other money in the city for that purpose, it was not, at par within the meaning of the legislative enactment. For some purposes the notes of city hanks are not equal in value to gold or silver coin; they are not received in the custom-house, and the holder might be put to some “inconvenience in exchanging them.

And the delinquent banks were the gainers hereby, for it tended to keep their notes in circulation in the country, whilst those that found their way to the cities could be shaved at a rate which would pay an agent and put money into the pocket of the bank besides. It was in effect a financial scheme for taxing the public for the benefit of the brokers and the banks. The legislature meant to explode the scheme, or tax it in turn for the benefit of the public. The banks were creatures of the legislative power, designed to furnish the people with a uniform paper currency, and as all the currency of the state in its natural circulation passes through the two cities of Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, each bank shall keep its notes at par at these points or pay into the treasury the two mills for forfeiture. Such was the evil and such the remedy proposed.</p>

    </p>
    <p id="b456-6" data-blocks='[["BL_456.5",456,[281,562,1174,1197]]]'>Now if the redemption of bank issues be considered “the transaction of banking business/’ it is not banking business for the sole benefit and profit of the bank or its officers, and so is not within the letter of the prohibition. But keeping notes at par, which is the thing enjoined by the 47th section, is not banking business within the meaning of the 50th section. The legislature did not intend to repeal by implication the express and precise provision they had adopted in the same law only three sections before. It would stultify them to so construe their enactment. As to the transfer of the capital of country hanks to the cities to redeem their notes, there are two answers; — first, those country banks which have always kept their notes at par have not found it necessary to transfer any more of their capital than was represented by that portion of their circulation which reached the cities, and to this extent they were bound to transfer to maintain a uniform currency. But in point of fact it is presumed that every bank has an agency in the city to redeem its notes, whether at par or a discount, the only difference being that in the one instance they are redeemed for the benefit of the holder without profit to ■the bank — in the other at the. cost of the holder for the benefit of the bank. If the Harrisburg Bank had shown that no city bank would receive its deposits and apply them to redeem its notes when presented, there would have been some force in the objection that it was not permitted to establish an agency; but this was neither alleged nor shown. Banks do continually deposit with each other and draw upon one another, and this has never been .considered a transaction of banking business out of the appointed locality.</p>
    <p id="b456-7" data-blocks='[["BL_456.6",456,[279,1760,1170,430]]]'>It was further urged that any arrangement for the redemption .of country notes by city banks would avail nothing in a suspension of specie payments. Very likely. It is not probable a city bank would redeem country notes when it could not redeem its own; but this is the exceptional case, not the ordinary rule. All banks are expected and required to be specie-paying banks, and the legislation of 1850 and the judicial construction of it are founded ,on this presumption. Of course, no argument drawn from the .unnatural and illegal condition of suspension of specie payments has any application to the case in hand.</p>

The court instructed the jury that if the bank and the accounting officers applied the payments to the years subsequent to Ma'y, 1852, no other appropriation could be made of them now, and that the application of the' statute of limitations to such dues as accrued prior to that date would depend on the question whether notice was given to the Commonwealth’s officers more than two years before this suit was brought; that the notes were not kept at par for the years 1850 and 1851. But inasmuch as $850 were admitted to be due when the suit was brought, though paid before the trial, the court held that if the jury found the notice, the Commonwealth would still be entitled to a nominal verdict to carry costs.
