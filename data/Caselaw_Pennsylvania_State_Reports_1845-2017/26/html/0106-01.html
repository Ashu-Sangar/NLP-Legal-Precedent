Mohr against Daniel Bickel, with notice to John Warg, as garnishee. The attachment was served on the 11th May, 1846, on the garnishee, and returned <em>non est inventus, </em>as <em>to the </em>defendant Bickel.</p>

The sheriff returned on oath that he served a copy of the interrogatories on John Warg, by leaving it at his residence with his wife, October 2, 1846. No answers having been put in, the court on the 19th November, 1846, entered judgment against the garnishee for the debt, &amp;c. A <em>fieri facias </em>was issued, and the defendant came in and presented an affidavit to the court that he never had notice of the filing of the interrogatories, and moved to set aside the judgment. The counsel of the garnishee contended that the service of the interrogatories to be effectual must be a personal one, there being no rule of court regulating the manner of service. The court refused to open or set aside the judgment.</p>

It is a general rule, although of statutory origin, that a copy left at the party’s dwelling with his wife is a good service. No statute makes such-service of a notice to take depositions sufficient, yet it was held in Snyder <em>v. </em>Wilt, 3 <em>Harris </em>65, that a notice to take depositions was well served by leaving a copy with the party’s wife: Campbell <em>v. </em>Shrum, <a href="/watts/3/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Watts 60" data-case-ids="1841271" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0060-01">3 <em>Watts </em>60</a>, is to the same effect, but there was a rule of court on the subject.</p>

      <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>The rest of the plaintiff in error’s case rests on a clerical error in docketing the rule as of the 5th August, 1846, instead of the 28th. The rule was to answer on the first day of the <em>next </em>term, and as it was not served until the 2'(^h October, and a term intervened between the 5th and 28th of August, the mistake of date was a very important one. That it was a mistake we infer from the uneontradicted statements of the defendant in error’s paper-book. Amendable at any moment, it is no ground for reversal.</p>
