      <em>■ </em>This was an ejectment brought by Daniel Smith and wife, against Joshua Grim and Andrew Giltner, to recover -two tracts of land; one containing 30 acres, and the other 79 perches. John Notestein was the owner of the premises in dispute, and on the 9th of March, 1844, conveyed the 30 acre tract by deed to Catharine Fry, who was married to Daniel Smith in 1847. • The consideration named in the deed was $500, but no money was paid. Catharine Fry had lived with Notestein from 1829, being then about five or six years of age, and her services in his family were alleged to be the real consideration of the conveyance. Notestein, on the 11th of March, 1844, made a general assignment for the benefit of his creditors; the proceeds of the property assigned were only sufficient to discharge the liens against his real estate and pay the expenses, of. the trust. Notestein,lived on the premises until he 'died in 1846. At the time of the conveyance to Catharine Fry, Notestein was indebted to Grim, one- of the defendants, and to Eisenhard, for which they brought suit against his administrator, and recovered judgments amounting together to the sum of <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>$742.22, besides costs. Grim, after obtaining judgment against the administrator, issued <em>a, fieri facias, </em>had the premises in dispute levied on, condemned, and sold by the sheriff on the 18th March, 1850, to Joshua Grim, the defendant in this suit, and plaintiff in the execution, for the sum of $440, and a deed duly acknowledged to him by the sheriff on the 2d of May, 1850. On the 21st March, 1850, Giltner, one of the defendants, under a lease from Grim, entered upon the premises with his family and household goods in the absence of plaintiff’s tenant; and the two remained there until 1st April, 1850, when the plaintiff’s tenant left and the defendants continued in the sole possession. The plaintiff also gave in evidence a deed from the assignee of Notestein for the 79 perches claimed in the writ. The defendants denied being in possession of this' “'art. This action was instituted on the 1st of May, 1850.</p>
