    <p class="summary" id="b52-7" data-blocks='[["BL_52.6",52,[289,639,1161,556]]]'>; The complainant was authorized as executor to sell or let on ground-rent the real estate of his testator by a special Act of Assembly, passed 29th March, 1851. And in July, 1851, by articles of agreement with the defendant, agreed to sell to him a tract of about 80 acres, situated in the district of Richmond, and on the river Delaware, for the sum of $65,600 — of which, $20,600 was to be paid in cash, and the balance in four or more ground-rents. The parties afterwards agreed that the ground-rents should be six, and also specified their several amounts, and that the land should be conveyed to respondent by six ground-rent deeds in the usual form. The land was surveyed and divided into six lots, and the complainant, at the request of the defendant, delivered the title-papers to the conveyancers to prepare the deeds.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b52-9" data-blocks='[["BL_52.8",52,[290,1494,1162,475]]]'>He at first declined because the complainant had not joined with his surety in executing the bond. Whereupon a new bond was given signed by both. The respondent then paid $18,500 of the hand-money and signed and acknowledged the ground-rent deeds, and left them in the hands of the conveyancer, and refused to deliver them or pay the balance of the purchase-money, alleging that there was a deficiency of six acres in the land, that amount being made up of gradual accretions from the river, and that there was an unsatisfied mortgage given in 1804 to secure an annuity for the life of an individual who died in 1806. The complainant afterwards procured satisfaction to be entered upon this mortgage.</p>

He insists upon a deduction from the price. But the grounds on which he bases .this demand are, none of them, solid or tenable.</p>
    <p id="b53-12" data-blocks='[["BL_53.13",53,[220,1332,1170,256]]]'>1. .The delay of the plaintiff in making title is not sufficient under the circumstances. It does not appear that any precise time .was fixed in the contract when the conveyance should be made. There was no delay which the plaintiff could avoid. In what there was the defendant acquiesced. It was caused, too, at least partially, by himself.</p>
    <p id="Au" data-blocks='[["BL_53.14",53,[229,1589,1160,244]]]'>2. There was an old mortgage on the land nearly fifty years old, given to secure a life annuity to a person who died long ago. It was not fair in the defendant to catch at such an objection as this. It was in fact no encumbrance. Still, in order to silence him, the plaintiff procured satisfaction to be formally entered on the record.</p>
    <p id="b53-15" data-blocks='[["BL_53.15",53,[228,1843,1162,559]]]'>3. The quantity of land sold was mentioned in the contract as eighty acres. He asks to be allowed for a deficiency. In point of fact there was no deficiency. It measured the full quantity, and rather more. But he objects that only seventy-four acres were inside the river bank — the other six acres having been added by accretions from the river. But for the latter he was offered a title as good as that by which the first land was held. The title to both was and is perfect. To call the whole piece less than 80 acres would have been a misdescription. It was so misdescribed in some of the proceedings, and the defendant would not rest until it was changed. Since this amendment, made at his own instance, he objects again that the accretions ought not to be considered a part of his purchase.</p>
    <p id="b53-16" data-blocks='[["BL_53.16",53,[270,2402,1116,34]],["BL_54.1",54,[295,431,1162,340]]]'>4. This land lies in what was once the district of Richmond. <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>The streets in that part of the city were laid out before the purchase, but not confirmed until afterwards. The defendant complains that they are so laid out as to make the shapes of the lots into which he means to divide the farm in some places less desirable than they would have been if the streets had run where the plaintiff induced him to believe they would. The burden of proving this lay on him. He has totally failed to show that there was either warranty or misrepresentation on the subject.</p>
    <p id="b54-6" data-blocks='[["BL_54.5",54,[294,771,1162,726]]]'>5. After the contract for sale was made, some of the buildings were burnt, fences destroyed, ditches filled up, and the property otherwise damaged. A contract like this vests the equitable title in the purchaser; and upon him the loss falls, if it be injured by an unavoidable accident before or after the legal estate is conveyed. Where the injury might have been prevented by proper care, the vendor is not responsible unless he has put himself under some obligation, express or implied, to keep it in good condition. No such obligation existed here, for the defendant might have taken possession of it himself and done whatever was required to protect it. He did authorize two persons to take it, and they have had it ever since. At least it does not appear that either they or he have been interfered with by the plaintiff. If the property has been injured (as it certainly has), it was either by the defendant’s own fault or by some misfortune which no diligence could have arrested. In either case equity will not allow a deduction to be made from the purchase-money.</p>
    <p id="b54-7" data-blocks='[["BL_54.6",54,[463,1496,991,300]]]'>And now, to wit, 20th May, 1856, this cause having been reached, and the argument of counsel having been heard, and the court having taken time to consider thereof, it is adjudged and decreed that the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia county be affirmed, and that the complainant do recover such further costs as he may have expended in this behalf.</p>
