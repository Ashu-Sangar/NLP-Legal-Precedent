In relation to titles to land it does so by adopting the forms of both, as legal forms, and treating all complete equitable titles as complete legal ones, where the persons named as trustees have no duty to perform that requires the seisin and possession to be in them; and then our common law enforces the trust as a legal estate. It makes equitable estates the subjects of alienation, devise, and descent, and of actions of ejectment and partition, and liable to debts, curtesy, and dower; in all of which particulars it differs from the common law of England as to both uses and trusts. And this principle, fully carried out, would merge the statute of uses, and produce, of itself, exactly the same result in the execution of the estate, just as English equity disregards the form of a trust when there is no substantial and approved purpose to be gained by it. We do not say that it would do to carry it out; but only indicate its efficacy as a general • principle. We have carried it out generally ; for even those uses that were not executed by the statute, for example, those that are <a id="p231" href="#p231" data-label="231" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*231</a>limited against the rules of the common law, 1 <em>Rep. </em>129, b; a use limited upon a use; a use of chattels real, and a trust to receive rents and pay them to another, 2 <em>Bl.

In the matter of ordinary trusts for individuals, the principle yields only where there is some sort of disability in the owner, that entitles him to the protection of the court. Neither law nor equity undertakes the special guardianship of all those estates that parties choose to create in a peculiar form. Most of them are with us mere legal estates in all their effects, and as to all the remedies for their protection. In England, the form of a trust not executed by the statute of uses, decides the court that is to administer the remedies relating to it; but even there the equitable estate is treated, in all material respects, exactly as courts of law would treat it if it were in the legal form. English equity strikes out improper restraints on the enjoyment of the estates, and also, when the beneficiaries desire it, all directions to sell land and distribute the proceeds; but it treats such eases as estates not executed by the statute of uses, and retains its jurisdiction for decreeing an account and conveyance. We generally strike down the trust itself, and treat the beneficial estate as the true one: 3 <em>W. </em>&amp; <em>Ser. </em>216; <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%2062" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Whart. 62">3 <em>Whart. </em>62</a>; 4 <em><a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%2062" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Whart. 62">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=3%20Whart.%2062" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Whart. 62">126</a>.</p>

And the administration of minors’ estates is not committed here to a Court of Chancery, and they have not, therefore, this reason for being called equitable estates. They are administered in the Orphans’ Court according to the rules of law that are applicable to them; rules derived from statutes, bommon law and equity, but not, on that account, anything else than the legal principles pertaining to the subject.
