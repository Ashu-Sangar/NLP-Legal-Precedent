The learned president of'the Common Pleas has shown in a satisfactory manner, that the county is properly chargeable with the costs. She cannot escape that liability by pleading such a sentence of the <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>defendant as that stated in this case, because she was no party to it.
