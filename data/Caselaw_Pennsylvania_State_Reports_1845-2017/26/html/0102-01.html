But it is an execution so far collateral to the judgment that it may proceed simultaneously with the ordinary executions: 5 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>222: and if it be vexatious and prodtice nothing, its costs are not taxed in the original case, but must be borne by the plaintiff.</p>

True also, the garnishee .claimed to be allowed his expenses in the case, and this was properly disallowed: 9 <em>State R. </em>468; but this is not chargeable as a part of the controversy, and was simply a submission to the court to decide whether now or formerly he was entitled to be paid for his trouble and expenses, and what amount.</p>
