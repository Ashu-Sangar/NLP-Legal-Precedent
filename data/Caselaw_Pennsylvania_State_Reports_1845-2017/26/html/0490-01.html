In the .special' verdict the jury find “ that the sheriff was spoken to by the plaintiff, John Keefe, in relation to the <em>fi. fa. </em>which was in his hands, and that- the sheriff was not delayed in the execution of the process' by the directions of the plaintiff, and that the writ was issued to prevent other creditors from levying on the property.”</p>

The fact that he issued it to prevent other creditors from levying on the property, when taken in connexion with the ■other fact found, viz., that he gave no directions to the sheriff which delayed its execution, simply means that he issued his execution in order to get the first lien upon the defendant’s personal estate. This he had a right to do. It matters little to the other execution creditors what the appellant’s intention was in issuing his writ if he did nothing to prejudice his rights after it was issued. He had an undoubted right to <em>issue </em>his execution so as to get the first lien, but he had' no right to use it'for the' purposes of a lien solely. If he had interfered with the sheriff in the performance of his duty, causing delay in the proceeding, and had given directions inconsistent with the command contained in the writ, his right of priority would have been lost. Nothing of this, however, is found in the special verdict; and if the facts are correctly stated in the auditor’s report and in the evidence, printed on the plaintiff’s paperTbook, there was no ground for the allegation that the appellant’s execution was not issued with the <em>bona fide </em>intention of making the money due upon his judgment. Whether the <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>decree was founded upon the report of the auditor or upon the Special verdict, it should have been in favour of the appellant.</p>
