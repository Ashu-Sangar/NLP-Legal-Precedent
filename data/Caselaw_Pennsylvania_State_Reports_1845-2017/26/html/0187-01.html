Before the supervisor had the fence taken down, he had caused notice to be given to the plaintiff that it must be taken out of the road, and it was only after the refusal of the plaintiff to change the fence that it was removed by the direction of the defendant. There was no evidence to charge the supervisor with malice towards the plaintiff, and even if it had appeared from the subsequent investigation that the right of the public to the road was not complete, it would by no means have followed that the supervisor was liable to the penalty given in the act under which the suit was brought. The language of the <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>act is, “if any person or persons shall maliciously or voluntarily break down any post and rail, or other fence put up for the enclosure of land, and carry away, break, or destroy any post, rail, or-other material,” &amp;c. Now in the case before us there, was neither a breaking down any fence, nor was there carrying away, breaking, or destroying any material of which any fence was built, but simply a removal of a fence under a claim of right. The case therefore was not within the purview of the .act, and the court belohv would have been justified in directing a verdict for the defendant. To prevent any future controversy, it is proper for us to add, that the use of the ground by the public as a highway for more than twenty-one years, made it a public road just as effectually as though it had originally been laid out and opened by the proper-authorities. The declaration of Jedediah Irish, if it had been admitted, would have had no bearing upon the case, and was consequently rightly rejected.</p>
