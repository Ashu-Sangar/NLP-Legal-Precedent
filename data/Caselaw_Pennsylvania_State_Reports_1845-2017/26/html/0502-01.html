Taylor the money due on the mortgages, and obtain his release; and that one of the bonds for $5075 was to be deposited with Mr. Mackey, as security for the liens of the judgments — which bond he was not to deliver up until the judgments were satisfied.

It was competent for the plaintiff to show his own acts in carrying out the agreement in reference to the releases; and what was said by him and others whilst procuring the releases, was proper evidence to illustrate what was done.

A few days before the first payment became due on the contract in suit, the parties met in Lockhaven, and the purchasers, learning that the land was encumbered by the mortgages and judgments above mentioned, refused to make the payment until the liens were removed. According to the testimony of Mr. Mackey, at whose office the meeting took place, it was finally agreed that the parties should meet in Philadelphia on the 29th September, when a certain sum of money was to be paid directly to Mr. Taylor, who had offered to release the mortgage liens upon receiving it, and one of the bonds of five thousand and seventy-five dollars was to be deposited with Mr. Mackey as security for the payment of the judgments.</p>

    <p id="b508-6" data-blocks='[["BL_508.5",508,[306,661,1158,86]]]'>First, a3 to the necessity of tendering a conveyance before suit brought.</p>

Mr. Mackey testified that the deed was drawn by him at the instance of all the parties, and left with him by Mr. Little, to be delivered to Devling &amp; Co. upon the payment of the instalment due 1st October, and giving the securities mentioned in the contract for the remainder of the purchase-money. This deed was before the parties at Mr. Mackey’s office, when the agreement was made that the money should be paid, and the releases obtained from Mr. Taylor, in Philadelphia. It was understood that the deed was ready to be delivered when the vendees were entitled to receive it, and as the jury have found that they have never complied or offered to comply with their agreement to pay the money, and give the securities upon the release of the mortgage liens, a formal tender of the conveyance before suit brought was unnecessary.</p>
    <p id="b508-8" data-blocks='[["BL_508.7",508,[304,1518,1158,86]]]'>Second, “That at'the time suit was brought plaintiff was not entitled to call for specific performance.”</p>

When the action was commenced the'plaintiff’s legal title was encumbered by the two mortgages, and by the lien of several judgments, and had the defendants stood upon their written agreement solely these encumbrances must Lave been removed before the purchase-money, or any part of it, could have been legally demanded. But the plaintiff and the defendants agreed that so much of the first instalment as was necessary should be paid to the mortgagees, upon the residue of the mortgage liens being released, and that one of the unpaid bonds should remain with Mr. Mackey until the judgments were paid and satisfied, and in pursuance of this agreement the plaintiffs actually procured the releases to be executed, ready for delivery upon payment of the money as agreed upon. Now equity will not permit the defendants to refuse to perform this agreement, and fall back upon their legal right to demand a conveyance free from encumbrance, when it is apparent that their neglect to pay the money is the sole reason why the land has not been discharged from the mortgage liens. But, thirdly, it is said that the releases executed by the mortgagees, or filed in court, are not sufficient to discharge the liens of the mortgagees, because one of them was signed by an <a id="p509" href="#p509" data-label="509" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*509</a>attorney in fact for one of the executors of Hugh Birkhead, deceased, without producing the power of attorney, and the other by Mr. Taylor, as assignee of S. B. H. Vance, without showing the deed of assignment. It is also argued that these releases are not binding upon the mortgagees, but that they can be withdrawn at any time before the money is actually paid, and the releases delivered.</p>

The release is signed by all the mortgagees except Vance, and upon its face purports to release his interest by his assignee.' No objection was made to the release when offered. Had there been, the assignment would doubtless have been read from the records of Clinton county. It is too late to make the objection now. Neither can we permit the plaintiff in error to allege that the mortgagees may possibly withdraw the' release without a particle of evidence, that any such intention on their part exists, or ever has existed, and when it is clear that the releases have been ready for delivery for nearly two years, and are now under the control of the court where the suit was brought. Upon the whole case we are of opinion that there is no error in the record which requires a reversal of the judgment. That upon payment of the judgment and delivery of the bond and mortgages, the defendants will be entitled to the deed and releases now deposited with the prothonotary, which will give to them all they contracted for, viz., a title in fee simple, clear of all encumbrances, created by the defendant in error.</p>
