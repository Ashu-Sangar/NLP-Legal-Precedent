But this mistake is of a kind that is always overlooked, because it never affects the merits of the cause; and therefore this plaintiff ought not, for this, to have been turned out of court.</p>

In this instance the plaintiff avers that she sold and delivered goods to the defendant, and he denies this. Her case shows that she is the legal plaintiff, and the description of her as administratrix goes for nothing. If it appeared that she had sold the goods as administratrix, and was collecting their price for the estate, nobody would hesitate in adopting this view: 8 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>124; 2 <em>Penn. R. </em>490. But the rule applies even Avhen the description does not truly indicate the relation of the party to the money or property claimed; as when one sues or is sued as executor, instead of as trustee or devisee: <em>5 State R. </em>510; 7 <em>Id. </em>243: or as administrator, instead of as husband of his late wife: 6 <em>Id. </em>348.</p>
