A rule was granted calling on him to show cause why a special injunction should not issue, returnable before the court at Philadelphia, on the first Monday in January next. At the same time, it was ordered by Mr. Justice Woodward, then at his chambers in the Eastern District, <em>“ </em>that an admonitory order issue (to the defendant directed) <em>commanding </em>him to suspend all action under the Act of 6th October, <em>1855,” “ </em>until the hearing and decision of the rule.” The present motion is to dissolve the order last mentioned.’ As the injunction operates on <em>the person </em>of Mr. Casey and not on <em>the railroad, </em>the <em>subpoena </em>might have been served upon him in any district where he was to be'found; and as he “ accepted service,” it must be intended that the service was legal. The judge, at his chambers, had therefore authority to make any proper order preparatory to the hearing of the cause on its merits. An “ <em>admonitory order,” </em>in the proper sense of the term, is such an order as he had authority to grant. But an <em>injunction, </em>whether preliminary, temporary, or special, cannot be granted without security, “ to be approved of by the court or judge, conditioned to indemnify the other party for all damages that may be sustained by reason of such injunction.” This is a positive provision of the Act of 6th May, 1844, which the courts have no right to disobey. Its terms are general, and they include injunctions of every description, except those granted on the final hearing of the cause.</p>
    <p id="b291-11" data-blocks='[["BL_291.13",291,[225,2301,1165,128]],["BL_292.1",292,[304,401,1169,720]]]'>Injunctions are frequently in the form of a <em>writ, </em>but these forms are not adapted to every ease, and therefore the prohibition in numerous instances assumes the shape of an <em>order, </em>in the nature <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>óf an injunction. As the courts treat the disobedience of all orders as a contempt, and enforce the performance of them by imprisonment, the distinction between a <em>writ </em>of injunction and an <em>order </em>in the nature of one, is disregarded in practice. Both are known by the name <em>of injunctions: ¡Eden on Injunctions </em>337 — 8. If the order be issued in mandatory language, it is substantially an injunction. If in terms of advice or caution, it is what has become known as an “ admonitory order.” Where there is no statute requiring security before injunctions are granted, the chancellor may use language so imperative as to amount to an injunction without transcending his power. To call such an order an “ admonitory order” would be a misnomer; although a harmless one. But under the Act of 1844 the case is very different. We must be careful to distinguish one from the other. To issue an <em>order </em>which is to have the effect of an <em>injunction, </em>without demanding the security required by the statute, would be an unjustifiable evasion of the law.</p>

In practice it is the business of the party in whose favour a decree is made to prepare a draft of it and submit it to the opposite party, and then to the judge. (Rule 79.) It is usually approved of, if not excepted to. As both parties were present when the draft was signed by the judge, and as no exception was taken to the form of it, his signature was almost a matter of course.

It rides down and nullifies all other laws which are inconsistent with it. Perhaps this is the very first argument, that ever was made, to show that a statute was void because it conflicted with a rule of the common law. To change the common law, and repeal earlier statutes, is the main, if not the only business which the legislature has to perform. A statute may be valid, no matter how inconsistent it is with the doctrine of estoppel, unless the doctrine of estoppel be a part of the constitution, which it certainly is not. When we are inquiring what the legislature <em>can </em>do, we are not helped a particle by being told what a court <em>would </em>do. When we are considering whether a statute ought to be obeyed or disregarded, it is very unsatisfactory to be informed how the law stood a hundred years before the statute was passed. Judges and chancellors have established certain rules of proceeding for their own guidance in the distribution of justice among Suitors. One of these rules is, that a party in certain cases shall mot be permitted to aver the truth; and this is called an estoppel. But the legislature is not restricted by it. The General Assembly can make and unmake all rules of practice, pleading, and evidence, at its pleasure. The power that makes the law must, in its nature and essence, be so totally different from the power which administers the law, that it is most illogical to reason from one to the other. The limitations on the legislative power of the state are not to be found in the general body of the law, but only in the constitution itself, which is the <em>lex legum, </em>or law of laws.</p>

That instrument declares that no law shall be made impairing the obligation of contracts. This charter was a contract; but one of its terms was, that it might be repealed if it should be abused or misused. The corporators did abuse and misuse it, and thus they placed themselves in the mercy of the legislature. Bid the atonement which they were compelled to make for their default, restore them again to the condition in which they would have remained if they had never been guilty of it ? They had a charter, irrepealable if they would obey it, and they were independent of the legislature. But they fell from that estate by disobedience, and their charter became repealable.

That is not in the bargain; and since they stand upon their contract, we do not see how we can give them more than what is there set down. The legislature agreed to disarm itself of the repealing power on condition that the corporators would remain and abide within their charter; when they went out of it, the condition was broken. The fact that they left the path of duty is not disproved by the other fact that they afterwards returned to it. Nor is their case at all helped by showing that they were <em>driven </em>back under the lash of a court.

When this immunity is bestowed on certain conditions, the conditions cannot be changed without changing the charter, and no such change can be made except by the express and plain words of the legislature. The corporation claims to hold the immunity, and for its title it points to a bill in equity filed by the attorney-general, and to a decree of the Supreme Court, and to its own act of removing the road. But the corporation itself cannot add anything to the charter, nor can it do so even with the assistance of the executive and the judiciary.

It is a familiar and well established rule of constitutional law that the prohibition to impair the obligation of contracts is not applicable to an Act of Assembly, unless it violates directly some right secured by an existing contract, bargain, or agreement. That provision does not protect from legislative interference other rights acquired or created in other ways. Here, now, is an Act of Assembly which enforces one of the stipulations of a contract between the state and a corporation. The corporators say to the legislature, “ You shall not do this thing. We admit that your act is according to the very terms of our agreement; but certain facts and circumstances have occurred since, which bind you in justice, equity, and law, to abstain from taking advantage of the agreement.” The short and conclusive answer of the legislature is this: “ To enforce a contract is not to impair it, and whatever the obligations may be which arise out of the subsequent facts, it is enough that they are not obligations of the contract.”</p>

We are clear in our conviction, that the right of repeal, under such a reservation, can be successfully denied only when the corporators are able to show that no abuse was <em>ever </em>cornmitted.

For the same offence, the charter might have been forfeited on <em>quo warranto, </em>but another mode of reparation was adopted for the very reason that the state did not choose to undergo the risk, and embarrassment, and delay of a judicial trial. She would not have the machinery of a court interposed between her and her rights. She did not desire to play with lawyers and judges at the game of special pleading. She was unwilling to go for justice to a place where estoppels might prevent her from asserting the truth. She would retain the right of legislative repeal free from all restraints but those imposed by the constitution, or else she would not grant the charter.

If this be true, the injunction ought to be awarded; for no legislature can do such a thing under our constitution. ( When a corporation is dissolved by a repeal of its charter, the legislature may appoint, or authorize the governor to appoint a person to take charge of its assets for the use of the creditors and stockholders ; and this is not confiscation, any more than it is confiscation to appoint an administrator to a dead man, or a committee for a lunatic. But money, or goods, or lands, which are or were the private property of a defunct corporation, cannot be arbitrarily seized for the use of the state without compensation paid or provided for.,) This act, however, takes nothing but the road. Is that private property ? Certainly not! It is a public highway, solemnly devoted by law to the public use. When the lands were taken to build it on they were taken for public use; otherwise they could not have been taken at all. It is true the plaintiffs had a right to take tolls from all who travelled or carried freight on it, according to certain rates fixed in the charter, but that was a mere franchise; a privilege derived entirely from the charter, and it was gone when the charter was repealed. The state may grant to a corporation, or to an individual, the franchise of taking tolls on any highway, opened or to be opened, whether it be a railroad or river, canal or bridge, turnpike or common road. When the franchise ceases by its own limitation, by forfeiture or by repeal, the highway is thrown back on the hands of the state, and it becomes her duty, <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>as the sovereign guardian of the public rights and interests, to take care of it. She may renew the franchise, give it to some other person, exercise it herself, or declare the highway open and free to all the people. If the railway itself was the private property of the stockholders, then it remains theirs and they may use it without a charter as other people use their own — run it on their own account — charge what tolls they please — close it or open it when they think proper — disregard every interest except their own. The repeal of charters on such terms would be courted by every railroad company in the state ; for it would have no effect but to emancipate them from the control of law, and convert their limited privileges into a broad, unbounded license. On this principle, a corporation might be rewarded, but never punished, for misconduct. Repeal of its charter, instead of bringing it to a shameful end, would put “length of days in its right hand, and in .its left hand riches and honour.” But it is not so. ^Railroads made by the authority of the Commonwealth upon land taken under her right of eminent domain, and established by her laws as thoroughfares for the commerce that passes through her borders, are her highways. No corporation has any property in them, though corporations may have franchises annexed to and exer^cisable within them.</p>

But what estate ? The estate endures for ever if the charter be perpetual; for years, if it be given for a limited period; and at will, if it be repealable at the pleasure of the legislature. This corporation, after its privi- * leges were abused, had an estate at will, and the Commonwealth chose to demand repossession. That terminated the estate as completely as an, estate for years would be terminated after the * expiration of the term. The grant was exhausted, the corporation lived its time out. Its lease of life was expressly limited, at the day of its creation, to the period when the legislature should dissolve it for misconduct. When the legislative will was spoken, its hour had come. Having no right to keep the franchises any longer, it would be absurd to claim compensation for taking them away. To say that the stockholders have a right to compensation for the franchises, because they are wrongfully taken, and that they were wrongfully taken because they have a right to compensation, would be reasoning in a very vicious circle. If the stockholders had a right to retain the franchises, the charter could not be repealed at all, with or without compensation. If they had no right to retain them, they have no claim to compensation.</p>

The corporators, on their part, bound themselves to build for the state a railroad, to be used by all the people as a public highway. This railroad was to be made between designated termini within a certain time, and in a prescribed way. In consideration thereof the state consented <em>tq </em>clothe the shareholders with a portion of her own sovereignty, to erect them into a body politic, to delegate to them her right of eminent domain, and to grant them the franchise of taking certain fixéd tolls from all who should travel or carry on her highway aforesaid. But the estate which the corporators were to have in those franchises was expressly limited by this condition, namely, that if the privileges thus given should be abused or misused, the contract might be rescinded by the legislature. If the corpora-tors did in fact abuse or misuse the special privileges with which they were invested by the charter, the resumption of them was not a violation of the contract. It is equally clear that if the company always behaved itself well, complied in good faith with every stipulation to be performed on its own part, and was never guilty of any abuse or misuse, then the repealing act was contrary to the terms of the contract, and unauthorized by the Constitution.</p>

But I do not see clearly the principle upon which it can stand. A legislative body in a matter like this is known to proceed without formal notice, without specific accusation, and without opportunity to answer. There is no confronting of the parties with the witnesses, nor nothing that can be called a hearing or trial. It would, therefore, seem unjust to hold that a legislative act is, like a judicial sentence, conclusive of every fact which ought to have been found before it was passed. It might more plausibly be likened to an award made by an umpire to whom both parties have agreed that the subject should be referred. When one employed to do work for the state consents that its value shall be estimated by a state officer, such estimate is binding. If it be agreed in a contract between a corporation and an individual that all disputes concerning the subject-matter shall be settled by the company’s engineer, the engineer’s decision is final: (4 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>205.) So here the plaintiffs agreed that the legislature might repeal in a certain event, and impliedly referred the whole question to that body. But even on this view it is not conclusive in any absolute sense' of the word; for an award itself may be set aside for plain mistake of law or fact. For myself, I incline to the opinion that when the constitutional power of the legislature to pass a law depends on matter of fact, the party to be affected by it ought to have an opportunity afterwards of showing how the fact is.

For a corporation we must have the “ charity that endureth all things, and believeth all things,” but to the legislature of the state we must deny even that common courtesy, which heretofore has always been considered as due from one branch of the government to another. Our experiment of a free representative government is not so bad a failure yet, as this argument would make it appear.

It is a maxim, indeed, that he who alleges a law to be unconstitutional, must show it to be so, and if he leaves it in doubt, it is valid. This of course means that the legislature is presumed not only to have put the true interpretation on the constitution, but also to have understood the facts of the particular case, and that it did not wilfully disregard either. It would be strange, certainly, if the judiciary would have so much respect for members of Assembly, as to follow their judgment implicitly in every difficult question of constitutional law, and at the same time so much contempt as to take it for granted that they are always wrong about the simplest matter of fact. The cases are numerous in which laws have been sustained by presuming the facts necessary to free them from constitutional objections. At our last term for the Western District, a case was before us where the title to an estate, which had descended to several heirs, was vested by Act of Assembly, for certain purposes, in one of them. We held that it was our duty, in the absence of proof on the subject, to presume that all parties in interest had consented to it. Crease <em>v. </em>Bobcock, <a href="/mass/40/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="23 Pick. 334" data-case-ids="2044329" data-case-paths="/mass/40/0334-01">23 <em>Pick. </em>334</a>, was exactly like this. The Chelsea Bank had a charter repealable in case a certain default was committed. If was -repealed, and when the constitutionality of the repealing act came up for decision before the Supreme Court of Massachusetts, it was unanimously decided that the fact necessary to make the law valid, must be taken for true, as an inference from the law itself. A few sentences from the elaborate opinion of Judge Morton will show the conclusion of the court. “ The legislature,” says he, <em>“ </em>have restricted themselves from exercising the power of repeal, until a certain event happens. This they must necessarily ascertain before they can properly exercise the power. Their decision must <em>prima facie </em>be presumed right. Whether it be conclusive or not, is a question which it is not now necessary to determine.” The Supreme Court of the United States have given their opinion on the point in a still stronger case, Cooper <em>v. </em>Tellfair, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Dall.%2014" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="4 Dall. 14">4 <em>Dall. </em>14</a>. The legislature of Georgia had passed a law, banishing a citizen and confiscating his property for treason. The state constitution required all treasons to be tried in the county where committed. The law was therefore void, if the offence charged upon the party was committed in any county. The court, for the purpose of sustaining the law, presumed the very improbable fact that the offence, though committed in the state, was not committed within the body of any county. On authority and principle we are clearly of opinion <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>that the repealing act must be held constitutional, unless the plaintiffs can show by plain and satisfactory evidence, that the privileges granted in the charter of 1842 were not abused or misused.</p>
    <p id="b318-4" data-blocks='[["BL_318.5",318,[336,540,1169,1062]]]'>But the evidence <em>against </em>the plaintiffs is so strong, that not much is left for presumption to do. In the first place, we have the record of an equity suit, in which it was solemnly decided that the plaintiffs had violated their charter by the commission of certain wrongful acts there mentioned. I do not say that this record proves abuse or misuse of the privileges granted to the corporation; for that was not the point of the inquiry. But it does conclusively establish all the <em>facts </em>charged in the bill, and adjudged to be true by the final decree. Whether those facts amount to abuse and misuse is another question, to be considered presently. This is not all. The same facts substantially have been proved over again by fresh depositions taken in this cause. The parol and record evidence together proves, beyond any possible chance of contradiction, that the plaintiffs put their western terminus, and consequently a portion of their line of road, at places which the act of incorporation did not authorize; taking and using for that purpose ground which they had no right to. touch, and which had been legally devoted to other public purposes. It is equally undeniable that they interfered unnecessarily with several streets, and rendered others wholly impassable; and that part of the Buffalo road was exclusively occupied by them. This was done in the face of a charter which expressly forbade them to obstruct or impede the free use of any public street or road. These are the facts. Now what is abuse or misuse ?</p>

The popular sense in which they are used every day is well known. To abuse, is compounded of <em>ab </em>and <em>utor; </em>and in strictness it signifies to injure, diminish in value, or wear <em>away, </em>by <em>using </em>improperly. Catiline abused the patience of the Roman senate. A man abuses his constitution by excesses which impair its vigour. A judge abuses his office not only by taking bribes, but by any misconduct which detracts from its dignity and usefulness. To abuse the freedom of the press, or the right of debate, is a phrase from which we take a perfectly definite idea. We know very well what is meant when it is said that legislative authority or executive power has been abused. Why, then, are we expected <em>not </em>to know that a corporate privilege has been abused, when we see it used as a colour and a pretext for that which the law pronounces a wrong and injury to the public ? <em>Misuse </em>is a still simpler word. It signifies merely to <em>use amiss. </em>He who would prove that any power has not been misused, must' show that it has been always used rightly, or else not used at all.</p>

Acts which would be an abuse of one thing may be no abuse of another. We are therefore to ascertain precisely what is abuse or misuse of corporate privileges by a company. Abuse includes misuse. We take them both together and define them thus: Any positive act in violation of the charter, and in derogation of public right, wilfully done or caused to be done by those appointed to manage the general concerns of the corporation. Let us analyze this definition.</p>
    <p id="b319-6" data-blocks='[["BL_319.5",319,[194,795,1167,1454]]]'>1. The illegal act must be <em>positive. </em>A mere <em>omission, </em>like the failure of a bank to make its annual returns, is not enough. <em>Non-use </em>is a different thing from abuse or misuse. 2. A disregard of the charter which is injurious only to <em>private </em>interests, and which therefore admits of private compensation, is not, I think, within the fair meaning of the Avords. It must be some misconduct which infringes upon a right reserved by the state for the benefit of the public. 8. It must be <em>wilful: </em>that is, not involuntary, accidental, or the consequence of mere mistake. But I mean mistake of <em>fact. </em>Every man is bound to know the <em>law. </em>Especially are the grantees of a privilege like this bound to know the law Avbich limits and defines its extent. They bargained to obey the charter, not as they and their successors might happen to understand it, but according to its true intent and meaning. If we could allow them to have an advantage from their own errors of interpretation, then every grant of corporate privileges must be measured not by the terms of the grant itself, but by the ignorance of the grante.es. A power not large when understandingly administered, might become enormous in the hands of dunces; and the dimensions of the same charter would dilate and contract in proportion to the degree of intelligence that each new set of directors would bring to the business. So high a premium for ignorance would cause it to be feigned sometimes, Avhen it does not exist. The rule is a wise one which conclusively presumes that the managers of railroad companies, like everybody else, understand the law which prescribes their duties. 4. It cannot be said that the company has been guilty of abuse and misuse every time a subordinate officer or agent transgresses the act of incorporation, without authority, express or implied, from the board of directors. It is not sufficient, for instance, that a conductor of his own head should charge an exorbitant fare. But if the directors should establish a tariff of tolls greater than the law alloAVS, and compel the public to pay them, this would be a manifest abuse.</p>

The act of incorporation fixed their terminus <a id="p320" href="#p320" data-label="320" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*320</a>at the borough of Erie. They knew exactly where this was in 1842, when they got the charter. It is hard to see how anything but wilful blindness could make them believe that a subsequent change in the limits of the borough, and its erection into a city, was an extension of their charter. But allowing this to pass, what can be said for their obstruction of roads and streets ? They could not misread the command on that subject. The same clause forbids them to take down a dwelling-house, or run through a graveyard. They could shut their eyes as easily on the whole as on a part of the prohibition. They had the charter six years before they struck a blow. There was time enough for deliberation and consultation. Then they used it as a colour for the commission of public wrongs, which it expressly forbade. They lived in the guilt of these wrongs, and in the daily repetition of them, for six years more, and yielded at last only to the pow'er of an injunction. To say now that all this was involuntary, accidental; a mere innocent blunder, is not a <em>defence </em>but an <em>offence.</em>

Some of the citizens were in favour of it, some opposed it, many were silenced by the assurance that it was a mere temporary arrangement, and the majority perhaps were indifferent. The councils gave their assent with the express proviso, that they might withdraw it whenever they saw fit. But if the councils had given their absolute consent, and the whole population had backed them, what would it amount to ? It might serve some purpose as a makeweight in settling the balance of mutual grievances between the town and the railroad companies, but no man can seriously believe that it is a legal excuse, or that it would change the responsibilities of these plaintiffs to the state.

The unconstitutionality of the repealing act was then put principally on the ground, that our decree against the company on the former suit was an estoppel; an estoppel upon the state which prevents her from letting the General Assembly pass a law, or renders it void after it is passed. The notion seemed to be, that whatever was a good defence for a corporation in court on a <em>quo </em>warranto, would be equally available as a ground for setting aside a legislative revocation of its franchises. In other words, a charter that cannot be forfeited, cannot be repealed. Therefore if a railway corporation abuses its powers by committing a nuisance, no court can compel it to abate the nuisance without taking away from the legislature the power of repeal, at least so far as that power depends on the same abuse.</p>

One is a legislative, and the other a judicial act. The power of the legislature and the power of the court are based on different foundations: are bestowed for different purposes, depend on different principles, are exercised in different ways, and their acts are valid or void for different reasons. The right of repeal (if it be reserved) is a limitation of the estate, which the corporators have in the franchises; forfeiture takes away the franchises whatever may be the extent of the grant. The Commonwealth can come into one of her courts and claim a forfeiture only when there is no rule of law to forbid it; but a charter may be repealed without regard to the law, unless it be protected by some specific prohibition of the constitution. The law in some cases will enable a corporation, which is arraigned on a <em>quo warranto </em>to keep the truth away from the court, by pleading an estoppel; but the constitution does not forbid the legislature to know and act upon the truth in any case, whatever. Courts it is said lean against forfeitures; and this is perhaps truer, than it ought to be; but the legislative department of the government, when it has the control of a corporation, must be allowed to- lean as it pleases. The annals of jurisprudence do not show that these two things have ever been confounded before.</p>

The legislature passed a law declaring that the relation of landlord and tenant should nevertheless be deemed and taken to exist. This legislative act changed the effect of the lease to the prejudice of one party and the advantage of the other, and by consequence it destroyed a legal title previously vested.

It is now alleged that the Act of 14th April, 1852, and the decree of this court, pronounced on the 7th September, 1854, were new contracts between the state and the company, by both of which the state promised to waive all previous abuse and misuse, and not to repeal the charter on account thereof. If there were such contracts, the repealing act certainly <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>impaired their obligation, and is therefore void. Let us see if the fact be true as asserted.</p>
    <p id="b323-5" data-blocks='[["BL_323.5",323,[217,531,1164,636]]]'>We are obliged here again to repeat what has been so often said, that a contract between the state and a corporation cannot be raised by implication. Judicial construction in favour of a company will go so far, and so far .only, as the state or her authorized agents <em>intended </em>to go when the contract was made; and that intention must be expressed in words too plain for doubt. Apply this to the Act of 1852. It authorizes the stockholders to vote for directors in a yvay which had been previously forbidden, and it contains a general provision relative to the gauge of railroads in Erie county. But no intention to embrace any other subject is hinted at in the remotest manner. Yet we are asked to declare that there is an agreement in it not to use the repealing power according to the terms of the original charter. We could insert anything else into it just as easily. We might as well say that it contains a contract to sell the Commonwealth out and out.</p>
    <p id="b323-6" data-blocks='[["BL_323.6",323,[210,1176,1171,556]]]'>It is, if possible, more difficult still to make a contract out of -our decree for the removal of the road. It has no single element of a contract in it. No thought of bargaining was in the mind of any judge or counsel or party. Least of all, did we intend to take from the General Assembly any power which the constitution bestowed, or add any privilege to the company which the charter did not give. On the contrary, we expressly declared that nothing beyond the. charter could be expected at our hands. If we have any authority to make a new contract, or to change the terms of an old one between the state and a corporation, we have all along been mistaking the nature of our functions; and if a decree and a contract be the same thing, we have heretofore misunderstood the meaning of both words.</p>

It is no part of the law. When the words of the enacting -clause are very doubtful, we may look at the preamble as one means of discovering the intent of the lawgiver. It is a very unsatisfactory resort even for that purpose, as is abundantly shown by the authorities collected in <em>Dwarris on Statutes, </em>p. 655, and by general opinions of this court: <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20355" class="citation" data-index="48" data-cite="1 Watts 355">1 <em>Watts </em>355</a>; 4 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>151. But this is no question of construction. Nobody doubts the meaning of the act under consideration. It is undeniably intended to repeal the company’s charter; and what is more, the preamble has not a word in it inconsistent with that intention. It is conceded that the preamble is inartistieally drawn. Some important facts are" omitted, and others are defectively stated. But the law would be go'od without a preamble, and a bad one does not hurt it. If the proposition could be admitted that a statute of which the whole enacting part is clear, unambiguous, and free from all conflict with <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>the <em>lex </em>legum, is nevertheless void because it does not accord with something said in the preamble, it would form a head of constitutional law as new and rather more startling than that of estoppel itself. We have said that estoppel is no part of the constitution; but preambles are not even part of the law.</p>
    <p id="b324-6" data-blocks='[["BL_324.5",324,[278,637,1190,1802]],["BL_325.1",325,[221,398,1164,80]]]'>J It is further objected to this law, that it is an act of confiscation — takes private property for the public use of the state without compensation. The government of the United States is forbidden to do this by the federal constitution. That instrument of course has nothing to do with this part of the case. But the ; state constitution also declares that “ no man’s property shall ’ be taken or applied to public use without the consent of his , representatives, and without compensation being made.” Does this act violate the state constitution in that part of it? We answered this in the negative when we refused the special injunction, and gave reasons which need not now to be repeated. Railroads built under the authority of law for the general purposes o? commerce, are public highways. On this principle alone~we~de-" cided that municipal subscriptions were valid. On this principle alone can land and materials be seized to make them. On this principle alone can the laws be justified which limit the tolls upon them. On this principle alone have we the power, so often exercised, of compelling those who have charge of them to keep within the boundaries of the law. On this principle alone we have always held that no individual or corporation can possibly have any right or privilege connected with them except what the law has expressly conferred. The charter of this company contained a series of regulations presenting the manner in which a public highway should be used; the repeal abolished those regulations and substituted a different set. By the charter, and by the charter alone, were the plaintiffs authorized to interfere with it at all; the repeal necessarily took that authority away. A public highway is not private property any more than a public oflice is private property. The execution of the law relating to an office is intrusted to an individual; a corporation as well as an individual may be intrusted with the execution of the law which relates to a highway. In either case, if the trust be abused it may be withdrawn; but neither the highway nor the office is thereby extinguished. The people still have a right to be served in both, and it is the duty of the state to see that they are. The removed officer has no right to keep the records, and the removed company has no right to keep the road. If this law be unconstitutional because it takes the road from the company, then it follows that no charter of a railroad, canal, or turnpike company can ever be repealed however clear the right, nor forfeited however gross the abuse, without leaving the highway in the possession of the corporators as |their private property, and giving them, as private owners, a con<a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>trol over it infinitely greater and more dangerous than they had before.</p>
    <p id="b325-5" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[220,485,1164,811]]]'>The suggestion that the repealing act will have the effect of putting the road into the possession of the persons whose lands were taken to build it on, is entitled to still less regard. In the first place, it is founded in manifest error. The lands were taken and devoted to public use as a highway for ever, unless the state should see proper to vacate and abandon the road. It has not been vacated or abandoned. It is to be used by the public as heretofore. The public will has been expressed that it shall be hereafter used in a different way, and the public rights upon it be guarded by different agents. If this be a vacation of the road, then the Columbia Railroad would be vacated by a change in the board of canal commissioners. Again, the landholders are not complaining of this law, nor have they authorized the company to complain for them. It is nothing to them whether the state chooses to let the cars run over the road under the command of one agent or another. But even if the landowners were here and could prove that the land has reverted to them by the operation of the repealing act, I presume nobody thinks it would be unconstitutional for that reason.</p>
    <p id="b325-6" data-blocks='[["BL_325.6",325,[217,1304,1167,1074]]]'>Another and most important point has been raised in the case on the final argument. Since this bill was brought, and since the motion for a special injunction, to wit, on the 22d of April, 1856, the legislature passed a new act of incorporation for the plaintiffs, giving them new privileges, and imposing upon them new duties and restrictions. This act was accepted by the stockholders, and under it the road has been redelivered to the company. Why then do they insist on a judicial recognition of their franchises under the repealed charter ? This might be hard to answer,.unless it be that they think the old charter more advantageous than the new one. They probably intend, if they can, to repudiate the contract they made with the state in 1856, and fall back upon that of 1842. But could they do this even if the intermediate repealing act were void ? Most certainly not. The charter of 1842 is repealed by the Act of 1856 if it was never repealed before. They will not say that the last-mentioned repeal is void, for they gave it their full assent. These plaintiffs then are before us demanding a restitution of what they call their rights under a contract which they themselves have solemnly agreed to rescind, and in whose place they have substituted a new contract, of which they are at this moment enjoying the benefits and advantages. We are thoroughly satisfied that if there w;ere no other objections to the plaintiffs’ case, we would be obliged to dismiss the bill for the sole reason that the law under which they claim has been repealed with their own consent.</p>
    <p id="b325-7" data-blocks='[["BL_325.7",325,[266,2376,1118,46]],["BL_326.1",326,[278,394,1165,514]]]'>The only specific relief prayed for in the bill, as originally filed, <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>was an injunction against the defendant to restrain him from taking possession of the road and collecting the tolls. Under the Act of 1856 they have got already what is better than an injunction — the actual enjoyment of all they ask — the full possession of the road. They need no injunction, and can have none, to protect a right which nobody intends to take away. But they have amended the bill so as to pray for an account. There is no averment nor no evidence of any fact which shows that they ought to have an account. We are convinced that the defendant has no money in his hands to which the plaintiffs even pretend a claim. When this point was discussed at the bar, nobody asserted that the plaintiffs had any just demand upon the defendant for money.</p>
    <p id="b326-4" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[275,908,1166,373]]]'>The prayer of the plaintiffs to be protected in the possession of the railroad and its revenues under the charter of 1842, must be refused. — 1st, Because that charter was constitutionally repealed in 1855, for abuse and misuse; 2d, Because it was also repealed in 1856, with their own consent; and 3d, Because they have the railroad in their possession under another charter which they have accepted. Their prayer for an account is refused, because they' show us no ground nor reason for believing that there is any account between them and the defendant.</p>
