July, 1786, a-warrant issued to John Stille for 400 acres, in Luzerne county, bounded on the east by land granted the .same day to John Donaldson, and on the north by the state of New York. Two separate and distinct surveys were made upon this warrant, located upon different land, one containing 400 acres and 94 perches, and the other 414 acres and 140 perches, being ■the land in dispute. These surveys both purport to have been made on the same day, to wit, 27th July, 1788. The survey of ■ 400 acres and 94 perches was returned and accepted on the 17th November, 1788, and a patent was issued to Wm. Coxe, Jr., then the owner of the survey, on the 26th November, 1788. The title -Was regularly traced from the patentee to the plaintiffs in this suit. From a list of returns made by George Palmer, deputy surveyor of that district, it appears that the other survey was returned on the 15th October, 1794; but no endorsement of return or acceptance appears upon the survey. The plaintiffs, on the 17th February, 1844, procured the board of property to make an order which is endorsed on the survey of 400 acres and 94 perches, as follows: “February 17th, 1844. The board of property direct .the patent upon the survey to be cancelled and a new patent to issue for 414 acres and 140 perches, returned by George Palmer, on the same warrant.” On the face of the patent is written, “ Patent of which this is a record is erroneous and surrendered, and new patent issued to Charles S. Coxe, and in trust, &amp;c., by order of the board of property, 30'th January, 1844.”</p>

But these acts are presumed to be done at the instance of the warrant-holder. But admitting he did all this, did he go far enough to correct , that mistake, if there was one, and did he correct the mistake in a reasonable time. I leave this question for the jury.

Coxe, on the 26th November, 1788, for 400 acres, 94 perches, and from the description, they would have seen it was not for the land they wanted. If they looked further, they would have found, that in the chain of that title, from the patentee through different conveyances, down to 1820, and all the deeds, up to the time they made the examination, described the land in the same way. Was •there anything to indicate that the plaintiffs claimed any other land than that described in their patent and the deeds following it ? If the jury should be satisfied, from all the evidence, that the return of survey of 400 acres, 94 perches, and the patent that issued thereon, was all done in mistake, the further question is whether this mistake was corrected in a reasonable time, and if not, and not until the right of the defendants commenced, it cannot avail the plaintiffs under the evidence in this cause.</p>

We are to determine the rights of third parties, whose claim intervened long before any proceeding was had by the board. Can a warrantee have surveys of two different tracts, accept a patent for one of them, and afterwards take the other away from a settler who has appropriated it in the mean time ? Certainly not. <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>There can be but one survey under one warrant. When one is returned, and a patent issued thereon, another one, whether made before or after, and whether returned by the deputy surveyor or not, is utterly void and of none effect. . If a warrant-holder can have only one survey, but has caused two to be made and returned,' he must make his election between them, or run the risk of losing both. That election cannot be made in any way more emphatic than by choosing on which of the two his patent shall issue. After he has done this, the land not patented is as much open to a subsequent warrantee or settler as if it had never been surveyed at all. .</p>

They ask us to let them abandon a tract which they have bought, and compensate them for it by giving them a different tract which has been paid for by other persons. A patent acquiesced in for fifty-six years is to be nullified, and a new one issued to cover an improve-' ment which was twenty-three years old before the settler had any notice, actual or constructive, that an adverse claim existed. We are of opinion that when.the defendants went on the land in dispute it was vacant to all intents and purposes. The survey on the ground was nothing, for it professed to be made on a warrant which had long before been satisfied by another survey and patent.</p>

The fair presumption is that every man understands what he does or causes to be done about his own business. Before an error like this is admitted, it ought to be clearly proved.

Their points must therefore have been either erroneous or immaterial; and a failure to answer them could do no harm to anybody but the defendants, who are of course not complaining.</p>
