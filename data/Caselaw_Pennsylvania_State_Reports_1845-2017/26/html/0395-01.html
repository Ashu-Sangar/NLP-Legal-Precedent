And during the term of his office, he, the said George W. Johnston, while discharging the duties of prothonotary, received from suitors at the prothonotary’s office of said county, the sum of $159.17 of costs belonging and due to the said Joseph Smith, his predecessor in office, which were taxed on the dockets of said office and paid to the said George W. Johnston at different times and in small sums as per statement of the same hereto annexed, which, with the records of the cases therein mentioned or referred to, are made part of this case stated.
