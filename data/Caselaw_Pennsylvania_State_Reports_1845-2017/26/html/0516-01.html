Louisa Yenner, his wife, survived him, and continued in possession of the real and personal property mentioned in his will, except the articles bequeathed to Henry Ziegley, which he got. And on the 14th day of April, 1850, the said Louisa Yenner, for a valuable consideration, conveyed to Charles Walter all her right, title, and interest in said real and personal estate, to which she was entitled under the said will. In 1856, the said widow, Louisa Yenner, died. The personal estate sold at her death for $29. It was appraised at the death of the testator at $100., On the 23d day of April, 1856, the plaintiff, as executor as aforesaid, sold the real estate of the said Peter Yenner, deceased, consisting of a house and lot of ground in the borough of York, to Simon Kopp, one of the defendants, for the sum of $1000, payable in cash on the delivery of the deed and possession, and the said purchaser, with Jacob Kopp as his surety, subscribed an agreement to pay the said purchase-money, according to the conditions of sale.</p>

The testator gives to his wife Louisa “ so much of my real and personal estate as the law allows her under the intestate laws of Pennsylvania, <em>absolutely.” </em>After a small legacy to Henry Zeigley, the testator then gives the <em>residue </em>of his estate to his wife for life, remainder to a brother and sisters, share and share alike. He died without issue. If the word “ absolutely” had been omitted from the devise, the widow would have taken a life estate only in the quantity allowed by the intestate laws. But the insertion of that word in the will shows that the testator intended to give her a fee simple. To hold that she took merely a life estate is to give no effect whatever to a word of known signification. There are other reasons in support of this construction, but it is not necessary to state them, as the case is a clear one. The power given to the executors to sell at the death of the wife, and to divide the proceeds, “as I have directed the same to be divided” manifestly relates to that part of the estate which was to be divided, “ share and share alike,” among his brother and sisters. It has no relation to the moiety given in fee simple to the widow, about which <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>there was no direction for a division. The reference to the intestate laws fixes the <em>quantity </em>of land devised — the term “ absolutely” determines the nature of the <em>estate. </em>As the widow takes a fee simple in one-half the testator’s real estate, the judgment for the defendant, on the case stated, must be affirmed.</p>
