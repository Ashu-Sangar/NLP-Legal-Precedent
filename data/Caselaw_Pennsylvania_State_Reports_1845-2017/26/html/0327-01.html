The parties appeared before the arbitrators, and Rebecca also appeared, and the claims of all of them were urged and passed upon, and an award made giving to Rebecca Lobb the sum of $1000.

It can scarcely be doubted from the evidence in the cause that such an arrangement took place, as the evidence is full upon the point, and I have to say to you that ‘ if you believe that an arrangement and settlement was made among the parties interested in the estate of Benjamin Lobb, deceased, to the effect that George Lobb should be credited as administrator, &amp;c., of Benjamin Lobb, deceased, with the-amount of the award in favour of Rebecca Lobb, and pay Rebecca Lobb that amount — and that this arrangement was acceded to by <em>Rebecca Lobb, </em>and settlement made accordingly, the remedy <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>against the administrators .upon the award is extinguished, and the suit should be brought against George Lobb personally.’ It is due to justice to say, that there is evidence in the testimony of Mr. Hannum, of the existence of such an arrangement, which you ought not lightly to disregard.</p>

In this view, the evidence is irresistible to prove an arrangement such as before indicated. We have then the fact proved without contradiction, that George Lobb took upon himself, by the settlement of the parties, the payment of the sum awarded to Rebecca Lobb.

If Rebecca Lobb did not agree to the arrangement by which she was to look to George Lobb for payment, and relinquish her rights against the estate of Benjamin Lobb, she cannot be made to pursue George Lobb, and her action is properly conceived against the administration. If, on the contrary, she did agree to the arrangement, and did relinquish her claim against the estate of Benjamin Lobb, deceased, then the present action is improperly conceived, and she cannot recover. The evidence on this point is plain and readily remembered. Mr. Hannum saw her while the arrangement was being made — he says she stated she had never been paid. ‘I stated to her that if she held them both responsible, says the witness— meaning the administrators of Benjamin Lobb — they could not settle it in that way unless security should be given.
