Blight, deceased, against Jacob 0. Ewing. In 1847 the premises, consisting of an unimproved and unproductive lot on the Ridge Road near the old House of Refuge, containing about six acres, was owned by Mrs. Elizabeth B. Sergeant, the mother-of plaintiff’s testatrix, subject to a ground rent of $2000 per annum. On the second of March, 1847, Mrs. Sergeant and the defendant entered into an agreement, by which the defendant was to have the leasing or selling of the property for her, and -whenever it became necessary to pay off the ground rent, Ewing was to loan her $10,000, and she to raise the balance of $25,000. Ewing was to contribute his services in selling or renting the property, and the net profits were to be equally.divided between them.' Under this agreement Ewing entered upon the property and erected buildings and leased them. The contracts were in the joint names of himself and Mrs. Sergeant. Mrs. Sergeant died on the 8th June, 1852, having devised the property to her daughter, Mrs. Blight.</p>

On the 13th July, 1852, Mrs. Blight brought an ejectment against him for the premises, and on the 16th of November of the same year obtained a verdict for the same. She died shortly afterwards, and her executors were substituted, and -judgment entered on the verdict on the 14th February, 1853; and the judgment afterwards affirmed on writ of error brought to this court, and a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem </em>issued, and the plaintiffs put in possession, and this suit was then brought for mesne profits.</p>

B. Sergeant and J. 0. Ewing, gave to the latter no interest in the real estate of the former, but merely created an agency which ceased upon the death of Mrs. Sergeant. From the time of the death of Mrs. Sergeant to the recovery of the possession of the real estate in the action of ejectment, Mr. Ewing’s possession was a wrongful one, against Mrs. Blight in her lifetime, and against her executors after her decease, and for which wrongful possession the defendant was liable to respond in an action of trespass for the mesne profits.</p>
    <p id="b137-6" data-blocks='[["BL_137.7",137,[195,892,1168,387]]]'>That the action was well brought in the name of the executors, for the damages which accrued both before and after tho death of Mrs. Blight, cannot be questioned, since the decision of this court in the case of Cobb <em>v. </em>Biddle, 2 <em>Harris </em>444. It was of no manner of importance whether Mr. Ewing’s original possession was lawful or unlawful, nor how much or how little he paid Mr. Wright as agent during the time of the adverse possession, and consequently there was no error committed in rejecting the evidence contained in the 1st and 2d bills of exceptions.</p>
    <p id="b137-7" data-blocks='[["BL_137.8",137,[189,1280,1177,303]]]'>It is complained that the judge, before whom the case was tried, fold the jury that although it was not a case for vindictive damages, but merely compensation, in estimating the annual value of the land, they were entitled to treat the defendant as a wrongdoer, and in case of doubt, to lean against him and in favour of . the plaintiffs, so far as to be sure of awarding full compensation for the wrong done.</p>
    <p id="b137-8" data-blocks='[["BL_137.9",137,[200,1580,1168,261]]]'>The argument is, that the evidence which was offered and rejected would have shown that the defendant was not a wrongdoer, but that he came lawfully into the possession, and that injustice was done the defendant by first preventing him from proving that he obtained the possession in a lawful manner, and then treating him as a wrongdoer.</p>
    <p id="b137-9" data-blocks='[["BL_137.10",137,[202,1840,1166,216]]]'>The position is somewhat plausible, but it does not distinguish the original entry from the subsequent holding. After the decease of Mrs. Sergeant, Mr. Ewing, in withholding the possession of the premises from Mrs. Blight, was a wrongdoer, for his right to the possession died with Mrs. Sergeant.</p>
