To determine whether this rule will avoid the contract in the case under consideration, it is necessary to ascertain what the contract was, and whether or not it was an unlawful contract. From the bill of exceptions we learn that the suit was brought to recover a sum of money which the defendant had agreed to pay to the plaintiff for obtaining a purchaser for certain real estate of the defendant in the city and county of Philadelphia. The allegation is, that the plaintiff was not a licensed real estate broker, and that therefore he could not recover for services rendered in selling real estate.</p>

The contract was therefore neither expressly prohibited nor forbidden by law, nor was it unlawful by implication in consequence of a penalty being incurred in its creation and execution.</p>
