The case finds expressly that neither the President and Managers of the Company, nor the receivers appointed under the Act of 12th April, 1851, had such notice. That this is a necessary pre-requisite in all cases, is so clearly determined in the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Eitler’s Administrator and others, 12 <em>Ser. R. </em>277, that I do not deem it necessary to do more than simply refer to that case. It is there decided that the summons or notice to settle the account is required <em>in all eases, </em>before the officers of the treasury and accounting department can proceed to adjust it under the section in question. That is <em>in no case </em>to be dispensed with — all that is dispensed with is the process to <em>compel the party </em>to exhibit his account. Notice not having been given here, the act of the accounting officers was done without authority and creates no obligation. If it were necessary to add anything to the reasoning of Judge Gibson in the above cited case, it would be found in a previous section of the same act (section 11), which deprives a party who refuses or neglects to exhibit his account to the auditor-general as directed by the act, and whose account is estimated against him agreeably to section 14, of the right of appeal. Now it would <em>be </em>manifestly unjust to conclude a party on the basis of such a settlement, altogether <em>ex parte </em>and conjectural as it is, who has never been guilty of any <em>laches </em>or neglect of duty, or refusal to perform it — and who has never had any notice. It is argued that in the present case it was the duty of the defendants to have rendered their accounts at stated times; and that their failure or neglect to do so, brings them within the scope of the arbitrary discretion vested by the 14th section in the accounting department. But the case cited is also decisive against this view of the case. The notice to the party subsequently is of no avail, <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>inasmuch as the law expressly takes away the right of appeal to correct errors or injustice, and a revision of the account as settled would he entirely discretionary with the officers of the accounting department. As he is thus left without remedy, he ought not to he concluded on the ground of such notice and acquiescence. Having no redress, he could do nothing but acquiesce, and no act of his showing a want of acquiescence could have relieved him.</p>

In such a case, certainly, a preliminary notice that the auditor-general will proceed to impose the taxes on a given day is not necessary. Notice is given when the tax is imposed, and then an appeal may be taken and heard according to law. Here, no appeal was taken, and of course the tax must be taken to have been rightly imposed.</p>
