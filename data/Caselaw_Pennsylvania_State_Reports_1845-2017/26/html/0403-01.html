Shroder, the assignee of Peter Haldeman. Although not a party to the record, he was the real party in interest. It would certainly have been more regular if the assignee had applied for leave to defend before judgment was entered by the justice against the garnishees. We are not however, disposed to hold parties strictly to forms in proceedings before justices of the peace. Informally the assignee was admitted to defend, for it appeai-s upon the transcript that his agent appeared before the justice, and gave in evidence a certified copy of the assignment from the recorder’s office. The judgment of the justice unappealed from would have been conclusive alike upon the assignee and the garnishee.</p>
