M. About nine o’clock of the morning of his death he asked Christian Hininger to write his will, and said if he should die he wanted all his property to go to his wife. Hininger went to his own house, which was near to Ruoff’s, and wrote the paper in question, and brought it back and read it to the deceased, and he said that was his will. Hininger says, “ he was very weak <a id="p220" href="#p220" data-label="220" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*220</a>in Ms body, but had his full senses. I raised him up in bed for him to sign the will, and he took the pen in his hand; he said he was too weak to write his name and that it would do as well without it, because he requested all persons -to witness that he left everything to his wife.”</p>

The excuse is that he was prevented from signing by the extremity of his last sickness, and so are the proofs, but he was not prevented from requesting some person to sign for him, for all the witnesses say he had his senses and conversed about the will much more than would have been necessary to prefer such a request, yet no one of them pretends that he made such request. It is not the case of a testator prevented by the extremity of his last sickness both from signing and requesting another to sign for him. According to the evidence he could not sign, but could request and did not.</p>
