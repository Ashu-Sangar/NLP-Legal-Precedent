      <em>“ </em>The purchase of Williamson from McKnight and wife is an ancient transaction. It is more than thirty-three years since the deed was executed, and more than thirty years since the execution of the first lease from Williamson to McKnight, and we think it is as satisfactorily proved as transactions of ancient date are susceptible of, that the possession of Mr. Williamson, by his tenants and Sibbetts, and his heirs claiming since, has been continued and uninterrupted for that period. If you think so, the title thus acquired by Mrs. Sibbetts and her children ought not now to be disturbed, if, as we have said, the purchase by Williamson was an honest one. We think the history of this transaction shows the present controversy originated in mistake, <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>and not in fraud. Mr. Williamson may have honestly thought that McKnight and wife had the power to sell, and that by the conveyance from them he acquired a good title. So thought his counsel in the ejectment brought by Clark, and so thought the president judge of this court at that time, who presided more than twenty years in this district, and sustained the character of a sound jurist. But Mr. Williamson, his counsel, and the court were in error, and that error was corrected by the Supreme Court. If the plaintiffs have rested upon their rights until time has perfected the imperfect title of Mrs. Sibbetts and her children, they ought not to complain of a loss incurred through their own negligence.”</p>

It is true that an estate <em>durante viduitate, </em>or for any like uncertain time, in count or pleading, may be set forth in general terms as a life estate: <em>Co. Lit. </em>b. 1 c. 6, s. 56 and 57. But it is also true that the proper description of a life estate is <em>“ </em>where a man letteth lands or tenements to another for the term of the life of the lessee, or for the term of the life of another man. In this case the <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>lessee is tenant for term of life. None other of a lesser estate can have a freehold.” “But if a man grant to a woman <em>dum solafuit, </em>or <em>durante </em>viduitate, or for any like uncertain time, the lessee hath in judgment of law ah estate for life determinable, if livery be madeIbid. In the case before us, the widow had a life estate <em>determinable </em>upon the contingency of her marriage, with a contingent limitation to herself and her children as tenants in common in fee simple: Buckworth v. Theskell, 3 <em>B. &amp; P. </em>652, note. It is sometimes called a conditional limitation: Bennett <em>v. </em>Robinson, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%20850" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Watts 850">10 <em>Watts </em>850</a>. But the name is not material to the present question, as, in either case, “ the estate was spent by the contingency of her marriage even without entry by the heir or devisee over:” <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%20350" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Watts 350">10 <em>Watts </em>350</a>. There is a distinction between a <em>condition </em>that requireth a re-entry and a <em>limitation </em>that <em>ipso facto ■ </em>determineth the estate without any entry: <em>Co. Lit. </em>b. 3, ch. 5, s. 215. “ The material distinction between a condition and a limitation consists in this, that a condition does not defeat the estate, although it Be broken, until entry by the grantor or his heirs.” “ But it is in the nature of a limitation to determine the estate when the period of limitation arrives, without entry or claim, and no act is requisite to vest the right in him who has the next expectant interest:” 4 <em>Kent’s Com. </em>126-127.- An estate for'life was, by the common law, subject to a condition in law that the tenant for life shall perform the due renders and services to the lord of the fee, of which fealty was constantly one. An alienation of a greater estate than he had was therefore a cause of forfeiture, because, among other reasons, it amounted to a renunciation of the feudal connexion and dependence, and implied a refusal to perform the services, and tended in its consequences to defeat and divert the remainder or reversion expectant: 2 <em>Black. Com. </em>274-275; 4 <em>Kent </em>82. But in Pennsylvania a conveyance by tenant for life, of a greater estate than he possessed or could lawfully convey, passes only the title and estate which the tenant could lawfully grant: McKee <em>v. </em>Prout, <a href="/us/3/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Dall. 486" data-case-ids="11739140" data-case-paths="/us/3/0486-01">3 <em>Dall. </em>486</a>. It follows that a new right of entry accrues, upon the death of the tenant ■ for life, against which the previous possession is not pleadable in bar. But in the case before us the life estate was determinable by the very terms of its creation. It was determined by the marriage of the widow in 1805i.. At that time Robert Coffey, the son of the testator, had a right of entry, but he did not avail himself' of it. On the 26th November, 1814, Elizabeth, his daughter, in whose right this suit is brought, was born. In 1815 her father died. The possession of the widow might fairly be considered as permissive, and not adverse until she joined in the conveyance to "Williamson in 1822. Prom .that period the indications of an adverse possession by Williamson were too plain to be disregarded. Elizabeth Coffey being then under age, was entitled to ten years. <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>after that disability was removed, to bring her action. In 1845, if the possession was adverse, her right was barred. She could not tack the disability of coverture to that of infancy: Weddle <em>v. </em>Robertson, <a href="/watts/6/0486-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Watts 486" data-case-ids="1846040" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0486-01">6 <em>Watts </em>486</a>; Rankin <em>v. </em>Tynbrook, <a href="/watts/6/0388-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Watts 388" data-case-ids="1846063" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0388-01">6 <em>Watts </em>388</a>, 391; Carlisle <em>v. </em>Stitler, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Pa.%206" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Pa. 6">1 <em>Pa.

    <p id="b482-6" data-blocks='[["BL_482.5",482,[297,661,1167,345]]]'>■ But it is supposed that the plaintiffs, or those under whom they claim, ought to have been notified of the adverse holding. This might be necessary in order to convert the possession of a trustee, or the widow who stood in that character, into a hostile holding. But where the widow executed a conveyance to a stranger and delivered up the possession to him, and that act is found to be “ open, notorious, and visible,” direct notice to the party affected by it is not necessary: Dikeman <em>v. </em>Parrish, 6 <em>Barr </em>225, 227.</p>
    <p id="b482-7" data-blocks='[["BL_482.6",482,[295,1005,1169,472]]]'>Conceding that the conveyance was in violation of the trust, and that the recitals might lead the vendee to a knowledge of the fact, this is not such a fraud as can deprive the latter of the defence under the statute of limitations. The violation of the rights of the owner was as open as the conveyance and possession. There is no evidence that it was fraudulently concealed. On the contrary, two of the heirs were present at it. A person claiming the title of two others made it the subject of judicial investigation in the Supreme Court in 1828. These facts, and the notoriety of the possession, the assessments, the recording of the deed — were matters sufficient to arrest the attention of the remaining heir.</p>
