Mr. Lewis appeared for Siter, James &amp; Co., and Mr. Pennypaeker for Antrim P. Morgan and several of the lien creditors. On the 12th of June last, the auditor made a partial report to the court, distributing to the lien creditors .$6,330.57 — which paid all the liens (with interest to the day of sale of the land) obtained prior to the contract entered into between Joseph C. Morgan and Antrim P. Morgan, for the sale and purchase of the land sold by the sheriff. This left of the fund in court $485.02, from which is to be deducted the prothonotary’s commissions, and cost of audit, $66, leaving $419.02 yet to be disposed of. It is proper to notice, before entering upon the examination of the questions which arise with reference to the distribution of this balance, that the liens entered prior to the date of the contract between Joseph and Antrim, exceed the amount of purchase-money which Antrim was to'pay. <em>% fhh&gt;&lt; '‡ 4* </em>(tu.-. /A/S</p>

On the 20th of October, 1853, Joseph exposed the land to sale, by public auction, and sold the same to Antrim for <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>$7,350, under written conditions, which, together with Antrim’s . acknowledgment of purchase, will he annexed to this report. The purchase-money was to be applied, feo far as necessary, to the discharge of the encumbrances on or before the - first of April then next, at which time a - conveyance of the property was to be delivered to the purchaser. To January Term, 1854, a fi. fa. was issued on a judgment of Jacob Moses <em>v. </em>J. &amp; A. Morgan for $380 with interest, under which personal property of Joseph was sold to the amount of $339. To the same term a fi. fa. was issued by the same plaintiff against the same defendant on a judgment for $300, with interest, which was retened <em>nulla Iona. </em>To the same term a fi. fa. was issued by John Moses against the same defendants, on a judgment for $980 with interest, under which the land mentioned was levied upon and condemned. To April Term, 1854, ■ a vend. exp. was issued upon the last-mentioned judgment, and on the 11th of March, 1854, the land was sold for $6,850, subject to a mortgage for $1,000 with interest.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b179-7" data-blocks='[["BL_179.5",179,[193,1144,1186,861]]]'>“ The claim of Antrim P. Morgan to the balance of purchase-money is resisted on the ground that he had <em>no interest in the land. </em>To determine this question it is necessary, in the first place, to ascertain what the contract between Joseph and Antrim was, so far as it is exhibited by the writing annexed, it is clear and readily understood. But it is alleged that before the property was put - up at Joseph’s sale, it was agreed between Joseph and Antrim, that if Antrim purchased and Moses proceeded against the property on his lien, the parties were to be released from the contract. To establish a parol agreement to affect the terms of a written contract, the proof should be <em>entirely satisfactory. </em>The only evidence to support this allegation of a parol agreement is to be found in the testimony of Joseph C. Morgan, and this, in the judgment of the auditor, is insufficient for the purpose. Viewing it in connexion with the subsequent conduct of the parties, the auditor infers from the testimony of this witness that Antrim stipulated for the privilege of calling on Joseph to release him, in case he should desire it, from his contract, if Moses proceeded against the land. And this is believed to be the extent of what was intended and understood by the parties at the time.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b179-8" data-blocks='[["BL_179.6",179,[203,2003,1170,434]],["BL_180.1",180,[307,415,1172,945]]]'>“ It does not appear that Antrim ever exercised this privilege; it was his right to waive it if he saw fit to do so. After Moses had proceeded against the land, both Joseph and Antrim seem to have regarded the written contract as subsisting and in full force. Joseph was anxious to be rid of it, and offered to purchase his release from Antrim: while Antrim desired to adhere to it, and insisted on holding Joseph to its terms; and the language and conduct of the parties when treating on this subject clearly indicates that they then considered the contract of sale and purchase as binding upon them. Regarding the contract, however, as ex-<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>.hibitedby the written conditions of sale and acknowledgment of purchase alone (free from any conditions such as has been alluded to), the counsel for Siter, James <em>k </em>Co. insist that Antrim P. Morgan had no interest in the land, because he says a purchaser under articles before conveyance of the land can only be interested to the extent of the purchase-money paid, and here none was paid, -and because he could not have a specific execution of the contract in consequence of his neglect to perform his part of it on the first of April, 1864, and in consequence of the sheriff’s sale of the land which deprived Joseph of the power to perform strictly, and of the right, therefore, to compel Antrim to perform, and as the remedy by action or bill for specific performance would not be mutual, equity would not lend her aid for this purpose to Antrim. It seems to be well settled that when articles of agreement are entered into for the sale and purchase of land, the purchaser is considered the ownpr in equity of the land, subject to the payment of the purchase-money; he is regarded as trustee of the purchase-money for the vendor, and the vendor is treated as a trustee for the purchaser of the legal title, having no interest in the land beyond the amount of the purchase-money due. It does not seem to be necessary to produce this effect, that any part of the purchase-money should be paid; it results from the <em>contract.</em>

Did Antrim fail to perform his part of the contract? The first of April, 1864, was the time appointed for its execution. The purchase-money was to be paid in discharge of the liens. Including Siter, James &amp; Co.’s judgment, the liens exceeded the purchase-money which Antrim was to .pay. Prior to the 1st of April the land was taken in exe<a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>cution and sold. In contemplation of law the liens to which Antrim was to apply the purchase-money were paid out of the land. All that Joseph C. Morgan could require under the contract was the payment of the purchase-money in the manner stipulated; the interest he had in the land under the contract was only to this extent. This was done before the first of April, through the sheriff’s sale, and it left nothing for Antrim to do. The proceeds of the sheriff’s sale were subtracted from the land, and represented it after the $7,350 which Antrim had bound himself to pay had been paid out of it to the lien creditors, the balance Antrim is entitled to recover in the place of the land, unless there is something else in his way.</p>

It is true, as a general principle in equity, that where the vendor of land is unable to comply strictly with his contract, and is therefore without the power to require the vendee to comply by proceedings for specific performance, equity will not lend her aid to the vendee in his effort to have a specific performance against the vendor; the remedy must be. mutual. Where, however, the want of ability to comply on the part of the vendee, and therefore want of mutuality in the remedy by specific performance arises from the <em>default of the </em>vendor, he will not be allowed to take advantage of those circumstances; to permit him to do so would be to give him the benefit of his own wrong. This principle is well settled in 2 <em>Story’s 2Sq. </em>p. 106, s. 779. The inability of Joseph C. Morgan to comply strictly with his contract arose from the sheriff’s sale of the land. This sale could not-have taken place if Joseph had kept his engagements Vith his creditors; it resulted from his default in this particular. The auditor does not see anything in the circumstances alluded to, therefore, which, in his judgment would induce equity to withhold from Antrim her aid in obtaining a specific execution of the contract so far as is practicable, and this would be accomplished by decreeing that the balance of the proceeds of sale, which now represents the land, be paid to him. Mr. Pennypacker, for the lien creditors represented by him, claimed to be allowed interest up to the <em>return day of the writ. </em>In support of this position he cited Ream’s Appeal, <a href="/watts/4/0071-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Watts 71" data-case-ids="1842746" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0071-01">4 <em>Watts </em>71</a>; Strohecker <em>v. </em>Farmers’ Bank, <em>lb. </em>p. 81,101, and Car-lisle Bank <em>v. </em>Bartolett.
