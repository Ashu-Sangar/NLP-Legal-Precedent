Before the alderman the plaintiff set out his cause of action to be for <em>“ </em>brick sold and delivered, on account of which defendant contracted to pay a certain judgment, for the payment of which the plaintiff in this suit was held as security, which judgment the defendant has failed to pay and satisfy.” In the Common Pleas, the plaintiff filed a declaration containing the common counts in assumpsit, and laying the cause of action as accrued on the 10th of March, 1851. The cause was tried in the Common Pleas in the absence of the defendant and his counsel, and, as was alleged by him, by a jury that had not been selected in that case, but had remained in the box after trying <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>several other cases, and were sworn in this cause without having been selected by ballot to try this cause.</p>
