Adam Bard, one of the defendants, resided in the city of Reading, and kept a public inn there. David Wenrich was a farmer, and resided about ten miles from Reading in the same county. Elijah Wenrich was a son of David 'Wenrich, and, though having a family of his own, resided with his father, as a hireling for wages. On the 26th October, 1853, an agricultural fair was being held at Reading. Elijah hitched up his father’s team and carried several persons to Reading who were desirous of visiting the fair. These persons paid him the fare, and he kept it himself. When they arrived at Bard’s tavern they found his stables and yards filled with horses and carriages, and on the part of the street adjacent to Bard’s house, and on the same side of the street, there were one or two rows of carriages of his guests, placed there temporarily by Bard’s servants. Young Wenrich drove his team to the opposite side of the street, and unhitched his horses and tied them to the tongue of the wagon, and fed them from a trough placed upon the tongue with feed which he had brought from home.</p>

The horses were hitched to the trough by chains, which, it is alleged, were too long for that situation, and that when the horses stretched back they would reach nearly across to the carriages upon the other side of the street.</p>

Doubtless there was room enough in the street before Wenrich came there with his team. We hold that a tavernkeeper, on such an occasion as this was, may from necessity put vehicles of his guests in the streets — they are to be there but a few hours, and the impediment is temporary: he has, perhaps, a right to <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>do this, as clear as he would have to obstruct the street with his coal or wood.

      <em>“ </em>Bard had first occupied the street in this way. His row of vehicles was placed on his side of Third street, when Wenrich came there. The street was already narrowed by the width of an ordinary carriage. You know how Wenrich’s team was put up — narrowing the street still more. The horses were so tied that . stretching back they are said to have reached almost across the carriageway.</p>

The occupation of it by Wenrich, especially in the way he did occupy it — stabling his four horses at his wagon tongue, two towards the footwalk, and two towards what carriage way was left, and that on a day when so vast a concourse of people with their carriages and animals were crowding the streets of the town, is not to be justified on any ground of right or necessity. It is going to the farthest verge of the law, to say that any necessity could justify Bard in putting his guests’ vehicles in the street, even for the few hours they were to remain there — nothing would justify him in putting their <em>horses </em>there had he done so, and nothing could justify any other persons. The people were not to be subjected, for the convenience of anybody, or of any class of men, or of any business, to running the gauntlet, as it were, along their own highways, through opposing rows of horses’ heels. Economy may induce, or necessity may compel a man to camp out, but he must not make the highway his camping ground.</p>

If nothing of this kind was done by Bard or his servants, Bard should go free. If other vehicles were placed there by Bard or his servants, after Wenrich had put his there, that would be an act which, bringing the passage way to the narrowest limit, would involve Bard with Wenrich in responsibility for any injury that might result from their separate acts. Each acting for himself (though in a manner to conduce to the result, if they did so), becomes liable — and they may be sued, as here, jointly.</p>

It is true that Yohn lived in that very square and might have seen the condition of it — particularly when mounted on horseback. BAt it will be remembered that a cart was passing through, directly in front of him, and one might fairly enough think that he could pass safely through on horseback where a cart was passing or had passed.

Where one permits another to take his wagon and horses, even though there is no compensation made for the use of them, the owner is answerable for injuries occurring through the carelessness of that other in the use of the wagon and horses. He is not responsible for his acts of malice or wantonness, but he is responsible for his reasonable care. And so when the relation of master and servant exists ; the master is in like manner responsible for the care his servant may exercise in managing his wagon and horses; and that relation is not dissolved by the fact that the master gives his servant one day free (on which day the servant has the horses and wagon, and from want of care an injury happens), and the master afterwards deducts one day’s wages. If Elijah was using the horses and wagon of David Wenrich under a general permission or as his servant, David Wenrich would be responsible for his act of carelessness, resulting in injury to another, as if he had himself been managing them: if he was not so using them, then David Wenrich would not be responsible for his carelessness.</p>

You will bear in mind that neither of these defendants, personally, did anything directly tending to this injury. Bard does not appear to have been in the street at all; what was done was by his servants. Wenrieh was miles away in the country, and can only be responsible in case you find that his son was acting under a general permission to take the wagon, or as his servant. Their responsibility, if any, is for the acts of others. These are considerations which should have their weight with a jury in moderating damages.</p>

The servants of Bard placed .vehicles along the street to accommodate his customers, and young Wenrich, left his wagon and horses in the same stree.t, on the opposite side, to accommodate himself. Now, conceding that the independent act of each contributed to the result, can there be a ■. joint recovery against the two for the entire injury?</p>
    <p id="b489-10" data-blocks='[["BL_489.7",489,[196,1378,1171,260]]]'>The Court of Common Pleas instructed the jury that if each acted for himself in a manner to conduce to the result, they might be jointly sued. This instruction cannot be sustained. The declaration charges the defendants as joint wrongdoers. Proof of separate acts, not committed with a common design or for a common purpose, and without concert, will not authorize a joint recovery.</p>

Where one person aids, assists, or employs another to commit a trespass, or assents to its -commission, having an interest therein, a joint action will lie; but ■where two or more commit separate trespasses, or do separate acts tending to produce injury to another without concert, there is no joint liability, and consequently there can be no joint recovery.

The doctrine is also distinctly stated by Mr. Justice Kennedy in Weakly <em>v. </em>Royer, <a href="/watts/3/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 Watts 460" data-case-ids="1841253" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0460-01">3 <em>Watts </em>460</a>, that separate acts of trespass where there is no concert will not authorize a joint recovery, although the injury may be common and produced in part by each of the acts <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>complained of. One is liable for his own tortious act, or for that of his agent or servant, when done by his direction or with his assent; and sometimes, where he neither directs the act nor assents to its commission, when it is done for his benefit. And he is also liable for the tortious conduct of others committed in pursuance of a common design. But no one can be made to answer for the torts of those with whom he had no connexion, and over whom he had no control. It follows from these principles, that if Bard committed an unlawful act, by reason whereof Yohn was injured, Bard is responsible for the damages sustained in consequence of his act. Or, if the injury was sustained by reason in part of the unlawful act of Bard, and in part on account of the unlawful conduct of young Wenrich, each is liable for the entire injury. But the liability in either case is a separate and not a joint one. A recovery and satisfaction as to one would be a satisfaction as to both. If Bard’s acts were lawful in themselves when done, they could not be made unlawful by the subsequent acts of Wenrich without proof that Bard was in some manner connected with or responsible for Wenrieh’s acts. We do not say that there can be no recovery against Bard alone. ' What we determine is, 1st, That David Wenrich, under the evidence before us, was not liable for damages done to the plaintiff by the act of Elijah Wenrich; 2d, That there can be no joint recovery against Bard and Wenrich without proof that there was concert of action between the two in doing that which caused the injury to the plaintiff.</p>
