    <p class="summary" id="b189-10" data-blocks='[["BL_189.9",189,[172,1612,1168,517]]]'>This was an action of covenant upon a policy of insurance in the name of the plaintiff, Joseph Robertshaw, on the life of William Dyson, for $1000. The plaintiff was a creditor of William Dyson to the amount of $ 140, but it appeared incontestibly in evidence, that Dyson himself effected the insurance on his own life, and paid the premium with his own money, and that his intention was not merely to secure the plaintiff, but that it should enure in case of loss for the benefit of his wife; and there was evidence that this was stated in the presence and hearing of the officers of the insurance company. No questions were asked by .them, but in conformity with his directions, they drew the policy in the name of the plaintiff, Robertshaw.</p>

But every life policy made by the assured on his own life, is made for the benefit of others; and if a party so insures his life <em>bona fide </em>for the benefit of others, it seems not to be very material, whether he pay the premium with his own money not borrowed, or borrows money for the purpose: <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Phillips%20149" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Phillips 149">1 <em>Phillips </em>149</a>. These remarks are a criticism on the case of Half our d <em>v. </em>Hymen, 10 <em>B. £ 0. </em>724, in which the King’s Bench, under the controlling words of the stat. of <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Grant%202" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="14 Grant 2">14 Gr. 2</a>, ch. 48, held, that a policy by a father in his own name on the life of his son, in which he had no pecuniary interest, was void. “If a father,” says Bailey, J.,- “ wishing to give his son some property to dispose of, make an insurance on his son’s life, in his (the son’s) name, not for his (the father’s) own benefit, but for the benefit of his son, there is no law to prevent his doing so.</p>

Law and Bq. </em>171. We have no such statute. It is on the principles of public policy and good morals alone, that our courts avoid wagering contracts. A man may make any other contract <em>bona fide </em>in the name of a friend, as a trustee for himself, or for such other lawful purposes as he chooses. Why may he not, for an honest purpose, use the name of a friend as a trustee for his family in the case of a contract of insurance ? In the English case referred to last, it was decided, that if upon a proposal and agreement for a life insurance a policy be drawn up by the insurance office, in a form which differs from the terms of the agreement, and varies the rights of the parties assured, equity will interfere and deal with the case on the footing of the agreement, and not on that of the policy. That was in effect the case here, and it was so put to the jury. The contract was really made with Dyson; he insured his own life — the consideration moved from him — -the company knew <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>they were dealing with Dyson, they asked no questions — there was no fraud, misrepresentation, or concealment. Had the insurance been effected by Robertshaw, without any mention of the interest of any other, no doubt the objection would have been valid. It is true that in marine insurance, if a policy is effected by A. without saying as agent or for whom it may concern, the policy is only avoidable to the extent of the interest of A. in the subject-matter. There is good reason for that; it is a representation that he is only interested in the policy. But it remains to be decided, that if B., the owner of a ship, applies to an insurance company, pays the premium himself, and requests the company to make out the policy in the name of A., that such a policy is void. For myself, I can see no good reason why a man having an insurable interest may not insure it, and present the policy as a gift to a friend; and if such an agreement to give be made at the very time of the contract, why may not the policy be made at once in the name of the donee, the whole transaction being <em>bona fide </em>— no fraud on the company intended ?</p>

If Dyson, at the . time of the contract, constituted Robertshaw his trustee to receive the money in trust, first to pay the debt he owed him, and as to the balance, to hold as trustee for Dyson’s widow — then the declaration was true; he had an interest in Dyson’s life to the full amount insured — the same interest which Dyson himself had.</p>
