That the contract of marriage by a minor, after it has been executed, is binding upon the parties, is from necessity. As against a minor, it cannot be enforced at all, because it is unlawful to make it and consummate it, without the consent of the parent. It was, therefore, competent for the defendant to show that the father had never consented to the marriage of his minor daughter. Whether he had given his consent or not, was a matter of fact; and his declaration was good evidence of it. It would have been competent for the plaintiff to prove that the father had given his assent; and this by what he declared at the time; for it was not susceptible of any other kind of proof. It would therefore seem to follow, that it was equally competent to prove that he had declared his dissent.</p>

The reasons are very obvious — at least they seem quite plain to us. A promise to marry a minor does not require the consent of the parent or guardian to make it binding. If the defendant proposed, and the plaintiff accepted the proposal, it is a sufficient contract. It takes two to make the bargain — but it is not necessary there should be three. It is true that no justice of the peace or minister may marry a minor without the consent of the parent, but that does not affect the validity of the marriage itself, much less of the previous contract between the parties. Perhaps it is true also that contracts to marry ought not to be made without the consent of parents; but it does not follow that when they are so made they may be broken with impunity. The declarations of the father are incompetent, for the further reason that they are mere hearsay. If the fact that he disapproved the match, were a defence, it would have to be proved, like any other fact, by his oath, or the oath of somebody else who knows it.</p>
    <p id="b511-6" data-blocks='[["BL_511.5",511,[183,1149,1164,303]]]'>I have stated the rule broader than this case requires. The offer of the defendant was not to prove that the father <em>refused </em>his consent, but merely that he said he had given no assent and did not know of the engagement. If we should hold the rejection of this offer to be erroneous, we would be obliged to say that any man may trifle as much as he pleases with the minor daughter of another, provided he can conceal the whole affair from the parent.</p>
