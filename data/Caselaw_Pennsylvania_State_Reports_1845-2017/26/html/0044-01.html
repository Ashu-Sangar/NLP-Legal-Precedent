    <p class="summary" id="b44-9" data-blocks='[["BL_44.8",44,[322,1037,1162,428]]]'>This was a bill in equity, filed by Daniel H. Mulvany against John Kennedy, to compel the defendant to restore to him a certain way to which he claimed right. William Kennedy was the owner in fee of a tract of limestone land containing 138 acres, with a front of seventy perches on the river Schuylkill, and on the 25th June, 1833, sold and conveyed to William Bethel, thirteen and one-half acres of the same, with the use of a certain private railroad to convey limestone to the river, and the use of a landing of one hundred and eighty feet on the river. There was also a cart or wagon road at this time to the landing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b44-10" data-blocks='[["BL_44.9",44,[321,1464,1160,216]]]'>Between 1835 and 1840 the Reading Railroad was constructed through the lands of William Kennedy, and instead of building a bridge over the road, built it further up, and the road was then shifted to that place so as to pass under the bridge, and from there it proceeded in a direct course to the river, and the landing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b44-11" data-blocks='[["BL_44.10",44,[322,1677,1158,171]]]'>In the year 1839 or 1840, the Schuylkill Navigation Company raised their dam, which was a short distance below the landing, and changed their tow-path to that side of the river on which this landing was situated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b44-12" data-blocks='[["BL_44.11",44,[322,1849,1159,425]]]'>The company then dug a basin back from the landing and communicating with it, for the use of William Kennedy, and over the channel erected a bridge which was used as a tow-path bridge, and also as a cartway to give access from Bethel’s quarry to the landing on the river. The eastern abutment of this bridge was on Kennedy’s land, and the western on the land claimed now by plaintiff. This bridge was the only means of access from Bethel’s quarry to the landing, and he and his tenants availed themselves of it for six or seven years, and then ceased to use the landing altogether.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b45-6" data-blocks='[["BL_45.5",45,[154,502,1162,217]]]'>The plaintiff alleged that the effect of digging the basin and the channel or entrance to it, and the bridge over the latter, was to destroy the bed of the old road in that vicinity, to render uncertain its locality, and to increase the distance and the grades, over a narrow bridge under the control of the navigation company.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b45-7" data-blocks='[["BL_45.6",45,[153,717,1164,130]]]'>The plaintiff also complained that in cleaning out the basin, large quantities of mud and earth were deposited by the defendant’s workmen upon his land.</p>

The plaintiff notified the defendant to have them filled up, and the road restored as it was, failing to do which the plaintiff filed this bill of complaint.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b45-9" data-blocks='[["BL_45.8",45,[151,1104,1168,388]]]'>The defendant, in his answer, alleged that the basin and channel of which the plaintiff complains, were dug and made by the Schuylkill Navigation Company, under and by agreement between the company, William Bethel, under whom the plaintiff claims, and William Kennedy, under whom defendant claims, and that the then owners used the roads and .bridge, and acquiesced in the arrangement for a number of years. He also suggested that if the plaintiff had any remedy, it was against the navigation company, by whom the acts were done, of which his bill complained.</p>

The plaintiff’s landing and right of way might be taken for public use like any other private property. If taken at all, the whole case shows it was done by <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>that corporation. This, then, is an attempt to make an individual in no wise connected with the company restore that which they have taken without question of their right. No argument can support such a claim, and none is needed to answer it. The statement of the claim is the best possible refutation of it.</p>
