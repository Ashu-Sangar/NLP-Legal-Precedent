They stopped at Middletown on the 21st of April, 1853. Whilst there, a man named Ross came up on the raft, and asked if it was for sale. William replied he would sell it if he could get his price; adding, that he intended to run down to Marietta, and that Ross might see him there. When it arrived there, Ross went again on the raft, bargained for it at 10 cents per foot, to be measured in the presence of William Walters, the agent, and to be delivered at Columbia, but to be paid for at Marietta. The two Walters left the raft, and on their return they found by the marks on the logs, that the raft had been measured in their absence. The measurement was disapproved of by William Walters, who refused to receive any money from Ross on account of the raft. The next morning, Walters found a man by the name of Jacob M. Erisman in possession of the raft; who claimed it upon the ground of having bought it from Ross. The latter individual was never heard of afterwards. Jacob M. Erisman claimed the raft as a <em>bona fide </em>purchaser from Ross. Certain statements had been made in the presence of the two Walters, by one McBride, to the effect that a sale had been made by them to Ross, and by the latter to Jacob M. Erisman. There was some evidence also, that it is the custom on purchasing lumber to agree upon the price, then to have it measured and to make out certificates for each party. The custom in this instance was not complied with.</p>

Walters, to the effect that Walters had sold the raft to Ross, and Ross had sold it to Erisman and absconded, and wished to know from witness, whether he could not compel Erisman to pay him for the raft.</p>

The ground of objection was the conversation had in their presence at Auxer’s office, when McBride, as their spokesman, represented them as the owners of the raft. But supposing that interview to have been just what Auxer represents it, though McBride does not recollect it, and that the sons authorized and sanctioned all that McBride said — nay, to put the case more strongly still, suppose they had spoken for themselves, and claimed to be the owners of the raft, and denied their father’s property in it, all this would have gone only to their credibility and not to their competency as witnesses. It is not possible for a witness to disqualify himself and to deprive a party of his testimony by his mere declarations of an interest. If it were, a party could never be sure of his witness. A word spoken by him, or imputed to him, whether spoken or not, would shut his mouth from testifying, for the rule is that if one party has proved by testimony <em>aliunde </em>that a witness is interested, the other cannot offer the witness’s own oath to show that he has no interest: 4 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>298; <a href="/citations/?q=1%20R.%20196" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 R. 196">1 <em>R. </em>196</a>; 10 <em>Barr </em>167. But the very point has been ruled that a witness cannot disqualify himself by his declarations: Pierce <em>v. </em>Chase, <a href="/mass/8/0406-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Mass. 487" data-case-ids="2028482" data-case-paths="/mass/8/0406-01">8 <em>Mass. R. </em>487</a>; Pollock <em>v. </em>Gillespie, <a href="/yeates/2/0129-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Yeates 129" data-case-ids="812633,812668" data-case-paths="/yeates/2/0129-01,/yeates/2/0129-02">2 <em>Yeates </em>129</a>; Long <em>v. </em>Baillie, 4 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>227. If, therefore, the sons be responsible for all that McBride is represented to have said in their presence, the court was in no error in admitting them as witnesses and referring their credibility to the jury.</p>

Whether in point of fact there was a sale to Ross, was a question for the jury <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>upon the whole evidence, and it was fairly submitted. It was the duty of the court to instruct the jury what would amount to a sale, and it was proper for them to refer to the custom of the river, which required a measurement, certificate, and payment of money to complete the contract.</p>
    <p id="b470-6" data-blocks='[["BL_470.5",470,[302,625,1171,730]]]'>3d, 4th, and 5th errors. We have considered the answers of the court to the several points of the defendant, and we see nothing in them to correct. The facts of Jacob Walter’s ownership and of William’s agency, are established by the verdict, whilst the allegations of a sale to Ross, and helping him to deliver it to the defendant, or of any intentional delivery, or assisting to deliver the raft into the defendant’s possession, are distinctly negatived, and under these circumstances we think the action of trespass was well brought. The defendant took possession of the timber and used it without the actual or implied assent of the owner. This made him a trespasser. He had no title to it, for Ross, from whom he professes to have bought, had none. He had no lawful possession, for the plaintiff’s agent delivered none to him. It is, then, as presented by the record, the ordinary case of one man taking possession and appropriating the property of another without right and against his consent, and for such a wrong trespass <em>de bonis asportatis </em>is the appropriate remedy.</p>
