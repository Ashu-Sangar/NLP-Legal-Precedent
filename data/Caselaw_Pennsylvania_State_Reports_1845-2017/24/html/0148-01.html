As to the day this took place, he first said it was on the 3d or 4th of September, 1852; then, on being asked, he said he thought it was on the 3d; and on cross-examination, repeated his belief that it was on the 3d.

If the letter containing the notice arrived in New Castle on the 2d of September, service of the notice would do on the 3d, but not on the 4th. But if it arrived on the 3d, service on the 4th would be sufficient.

True, as a general rule, the notice must be sent as early as the first mail succeeding the day of the demand; but if the mail closes at so early an hour that it is impracticable to forward a letter by it, one sent by the next mail is in time. As the jury have found that the mail which left Pittsburgh for New Castle between 7 and 8 o’clock on the morning of the 2d September, closed as early as 2 or 3 o’clock of the same morning; it was not a practicable thing for a letter to be mailed on that morning so as to go by that mail; and hence it follows that one placed in the office in time for the next mail was sufficient. Leaving Pittsburgh at 8 o’clock on the morning of the 3d, the letter containing notice of the non-payment of the note would reach Dickson &amp; McClymond, at New Castle, on the same day in the evening, and whether they gave notice to Stephenson that evening or the next morning was unimportant, as in either case it was in time. An endorser is entitled to one day after he receives notice to transmit the same to his prior endorser.</p>
