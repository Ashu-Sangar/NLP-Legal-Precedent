Then, on the death of William, and John without issue, the e'state would have gone to James and the sisters, as heirs at law. But he did not stop at that clause, but added, “ if any of my sons depart this life without a <em>legal heir, </em>his part or portion, of him so dying, shall go and be equally divided among the survivors of my sons” — an impossible condition, if the technical meaning he assigned to the term “ legal heir,” <em>for </em>neither of the devisees could die leaving a' survivor, and be’ without a “ legal heir.” We defeat the manifest intention of the testator if we construe these words according to their ordinary signification. A former part of the will shows that he intended his. daughters should have the bulk of the personal estate, as the above clause proves that he meant the real estate should go to the sons. In respect to the personalty, he said in the last clause of the will, <em>“ </em>my meaning is that in case of any my daughters departing this life without <em>a legal heir of her body begotten, </em>her or their part or portion so dying shall be equally divided among her surviving sisters or sister.” The words of limitation in these two clauses, mean, we suppose, the same thing — the latter translate the former. The sons shall have the real estate, and if either dies without legal heirs of his body begotten, that is without a legitimate child, it shall go over to the survivors; the daughters shall have the personal estate, and if either dies without a legitimate child, it shall go over to the survivors. The expression “legal heir,” therefore, cannot be construed heirs generally, but must mean heir of the body or child.</p>

That such would have been the effect of the devise over if the word issue had been used, is too well established in our own authorities to admit of doubt: Haines <em>v. </em>Witmer, <a href="/yeates/2/0400-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Yeates 400" data-case-ids="812627" data-case-paths="/yeates/2/0400-01">2 <em>Yeates </em>400</a>; Clark <em>v. </em>Baker, 3 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>470; Caskey <em>v. </em>Bremer, 17 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>441; Heffner <em>v. </em>Knepper, <a href="/watts/6/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Watts 18" data-case-ids="1846130" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0018-01">6 <em>Watts </em>18</a>; Eichberger <em>v. </em>Barnitz, 9 <em>Id. </em>447; Langley <em>v. </em>Heald, 7 W. &amp; <em>Ser. </em>96 ; Lapsley <em>v. </em>Lapsley, 9 <em>Barr </em>130. If the words be construed child or children, the effect is the same, for the rule deduced from the English cases, as stated in <em>Powell on Devises </em>496, is, that they have established, beyond <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>contradiction, that a devise to a man and bis children, be having none at the time of the devise, gives him an estate tail. By the time of the devise, we are to understand, I apprehend, the time of its <em>taking effect, </em>rather than the time of <em>making </em>it; but the distinction is of no importance here, for neither when the will was made, nor when the testator died, had William or John a child. And devises to <em>sons </em>are governed by precisely the same principles as devises to children. Son is sometimes a word of limitation, and is synonymous with <em>male issue: Powell </em>503.</p>

Not one layman in a thousand intends it. But he meant to give his land to his sons aiad his personalty to his daughters. That is apparent all over his will. Then come in these artificial rules of law to effectuate that paramount intention, and to compel execution of the will, not according to some learned conceit or imaginary equity, but in the very manner the testator would have had it executed. Accordingly we hold that this was an estate tail in the first- takers. But there is no entailment of the remainders, and the rule that requires the construction in favor of an absolute vesting at as early a date as possible, prevents us from inclining to construe them as such.</p>
    <p id="b171-5" data-blocks='[["BL_171.5",171,[178,1320,1163,517]]]'>It follows, therefore, that when William died, the limitation over of his half took effect in favor of his two brothers in fee simple.

Thus James became seised in fee under the will of the half which had been devised to John, and one-half of the half that had been devised to William. The other half of William’s share which had become vested in John in fee, descended on his death to his heirs, that is, his brother James and his five sisters, as tenants in common in equal proportions. Consequently, the plaintiffs are each entitled to one undivided twenty-fourth part of the land in controversy, and together to one-sixth part of it, and the defendant to the residue.</p>
