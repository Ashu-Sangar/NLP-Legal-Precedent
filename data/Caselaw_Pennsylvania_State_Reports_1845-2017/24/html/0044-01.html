There was evidence of the defendant’s admission that he had promised to marry the plaintiff, and although the time of the contract was not mentioned, the jury might well infer that <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>it was previous to tbe 22d of September, 1853.
