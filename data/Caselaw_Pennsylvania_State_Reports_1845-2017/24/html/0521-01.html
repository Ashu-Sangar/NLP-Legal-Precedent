The rule requiring possession of personal property in order to vest title, is not applicable where the vendor is not in possession of the property at the time of the sale; but a sale of it in the hands of a bailee is good: 7 <em>Barr </em>89, Linton <em>v. </em>Butz; <em>Story on Bailments </em>282; so of a ship at sea: 8 <em>Taunt. </em>177. The endorsement of the bill of lading was not essential. The principal office of a bill of lading is to afford evidence of the contract of delivery by the transporter. As ancillary to that, it is evidence of the right of possession in the person to whom the goods are by its terms deliverable. It is not a negotiable instrument, nor does the assignment of it necessarily import a transfer of the property in the goods embraced in it.

In such case no other person than the consignee can endorse the bills. But even the endorsement of a consignee who is the owner is not necessary to a valid transfer of the goods.
