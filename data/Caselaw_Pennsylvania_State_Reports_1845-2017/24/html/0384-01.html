The paper-book contains no bills of exception to the evidence; and we have no reason to believe that the president judge mis-stated the facts which occurred on the trial. On the contrary, from all the means we have of forming an opinion on the question of fact, we have no doubt that the defendant did admit that he knew when he purchased the cattle that they belonged to the,plaintiff. The plaintiff’s statement, when fairly construed, was to be understood as founded on a contract with himself for the sale of his own cattle; and the plea of payment admits the existence of the contract as alleged, and puts the defence on matter subsequent. The receipt given in evidence by the defendant also admits that when he made or attempted to make the set-off of an old debt against Daniel McLennan, he knew that Daniel was acting as the agent of the plaintiff, Kenneth McLennan. The 1st and 2d errors assigned are therefore not sustained.</p>
