East </em>352; 4 <em>Ves. </em>329; 5 <em>Id. </em>401: unless the context indicates the contrary. If the de-visees took absolutely in common on the death of the testator, then the estate devised could not go to “ the heirs of the survivor.” The restraint upon alienation should also have some meaning. If the devisees took as tenants in common, the restraint was inconsistent with such interest; but, if as joint-tenants, it prevented the survivor from losing his right of survivorship. If the testator intended the devisees to take absolute estates upon his death, there was no reason for the restraint without his own consent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b57-7" data-blocks='[["BL_57.7",57,[176,1321,1160,300]]]'>It was further 'contended, that the Act of 31st March, 1812, did not interdict a right of survivorship expressly given; that by the said Act it was merely meant to declare that such a right would no longer be <em>implied, </em>and that it did not forbid either a grantor or devisor from creating, <em>in express terms, </em>an estate fettered with a limitation of the fee over to the survivor; or from creating a joint-tenancy by express words.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b57-8" data-blocks='[["BL_57.8",57,[165,1621,1170,762]]]'>It was further contended that the limitation “ to the survivors or survivor of them, and the heirs of said survivor,” was not meant to provide against the death of the devisees during the lifetime of the testator. One of the reasons for the construction, limiting the death to the life of the testator, was that when the gift was immediate, it was to be presumed that the intention was that the devisees should take as <em>tenants in common, </em>which was inconsistent with indefinite survivorship: 2 <em>Jarman </em>631; 10 <em>Earr </em>245; 1 <em>Harris </em>152. Put here the devisees take expressly as <em>“ joint-tenayts,” </em>which is inconsistent with a limitation of sur-vivorship within the life of the testator. The estate also is limited <em>to the heirs of the survivor. </em>The devisor conferred upon the devisees the power to grant a fee, which was not inconsistent with a limited estate in them; and the restriction, that after the death of one of the devisees it should require the concurrence pf both of the survivors to convey, evinces a clear intention not to vest an estate of inheritance in any of the devisees except the survivor.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b58-6" data-blocks='[["BL_58.6",58,[295,637,1158,1280]]]'>A limitation to survivors will not be construed to mean an indefinite survivorship, unless by the use of <em>express words </em>it appear that the testator meant that the last .survivor should take the whole: 2 <em>Jarman </em>450. The words “ to my brothers, &amp;c., as joint tenants, and the survivors and survivor of them and the heirs of said survivor,” do not expressly indicate that an indefinite survivorship was intended by the testator, inasmuch as the use of the word <em>survivors </em>indicated that the testator intended to refer to a period when two only of the three might be living. Any intimation by a testator of a division or a severalty of interests, is sufficient to make a tenancy in common: 5 <em>Binney </em>20; 2 <em>Jarman </em>117. The words relative to assigning, referred to the manner in which the estate was to be enjoyed, and not as indicating the kind of estate which was to vest in them. Where the testator speaks of <em>the survivor </em>being allowed to assign, he meant HIS OWN snARE, and not the whole estate: The case of Johnston <em>v. </em>Moore, 10 <em>Barr </em>245, cited. In all cases where there is a devise to two or more, and to the survivors and survivor of them and the heirs of the survivor, the words of survivorship refer to the death of the testator, and vest the fee in such of the devisees as survive him: 1 <em>Sams </em>152, Caldwell <em>v. </em>Skilton; 10 <em>Barr </em>245, and eases there referred to; 4 <em>Sarris </em>827, Jessup <em>v. </em>Smith; <a href="/citations/?q=25%20Wend.%20119" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="25 Wend. 119">25 <em>Wend. </em>119</a>; 2 <em>Jarman </em>451. If the construction now contended for prevail, it will give to the widow and children of <em>William </em>Jack the one-third of the estate devised by Henry, his brother. But if the construction contended for, on part of the defendant below, be sustained, the entire estate of <em>Henry </em>Jack will pass under the will of Wilson Jack, the last survivor, to one who is a stranger to the blood of Henry Jack, which, it was said, was a destination he most probably never intended.</p>

He devises it to them first as joint tenants, and then expressly provides for what at common law was an incident of the tenancy, viz. the right of survivorship; making the right of disposition to depend upon the assent of all three whilst in full life; of two after the death of one; but the survivor to <em>“ </em>assign, convey, or devise at his pleasure.” And besides, the word of inheritance is only connected with the devise to the survivor. Is it not clear then that Henry Jack intended that his three brothers should take an estate for life with cross-remainder in fee to the survivor, or in other words that the estate should be held and enjoyed by all during the life of all, by two after the death of one, and by the survivor in fee simple, subject to be disposed of at any time by the consent of the parties in interest ?</p>

It may cease to exist as an incident, and yet be legally created as a principal. That it was created in the will under consideration is apparent when we consider the whole of the devise. Had the testator merely given the estate to his brothers as joint-tenants, it may be that the Act of 1812 would have excluded the right of survivorship. Had it been devised simply to the three, the survivors or the survivor of them, it is probable that its true construction would have referred the time of survivorship to the death of the testator; but when we <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>find that the devise is to the three brothers expressly as “joint-tenants, and the survivors and survivor of them, and the heirs of said survivor, and that the right to transfer depends upon the assent of all, we cannot doubt but that the ultimate survivor was finally to be the recipient of the entire estate.</p>
    <p id="b60-6" data-blocks='[["BL_60.4",60,[299,639,1169,417]]]'>It is said that as personal estate was blended with real in the devise, the testator could scarcely have intended merely to give a life estate in objects of a perishable character. To this it may be answered that he had provided that the estate might be assigned at any time upon the agreement of the devisors, and it was fair to presume that they would protect their own interests by an early and final disposition of the personal estate; and besides, the inference to be drawn from the character of a portion of the devised estate cannot overpower the clear and unmistakeable language of the devise itself.</p>
