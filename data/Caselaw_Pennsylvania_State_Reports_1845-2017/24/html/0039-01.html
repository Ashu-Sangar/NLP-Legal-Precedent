    <p id="b41-4" data-blocks='[["BL_41.4",41,[153,626,1183,1031]]]'>If the statutory definition be applied to these facts, it is apparent there was no island there when this title originated. The insular character of what had been known as Smoky or Killbuck island, was swept away with the soil. The title of the Commonwealth to what remained was not gone, but was no longer grant-able under the Act of Assembly for selling islands. The foundation of the island belongs to the Commonwealth still, but she holds it, as she does the bed of the river and all sand-bars, in trust for all her citizens as a public highway. It is said the state may restore the island. Doubtless she has the right, if such a thing were practicable, to reconstruct an island on that foundation; and possibly it might then be grantable under the Act of 1806; but in 1849 she had no island there, according to her own recorded definitions of islands, and of course her grantee took no title. And that is the time at which the test is to be applied, and not the date of the law, as argued. The Act of 1806 was not a grant of the state’s title, but only a mode prescribed in which titles might thereafter be granted. It would apply, no doubt, to islands formed by natural causes after its passage; and it is equally certain that • it would cease to be applicable to islands existing at its date, but disappearing before application filed. The plaintiffs’ title relates not back to the date of the law, but commenced with his application, and at that time Smoky or Killbuck Island was among the things beyond the flood.</p>

The Act of 1792, prescribing the effect of their decisions upon <em>patents </em>for land, has no application to a proceeding of this sort. And, besides, the report of the appraisers, on which the board acted, left open for judicial decision the very questions which have been adjudicated in this case. The presumption is a fair one that the board intended to leave them as their appraisers left them. Whether this be so or not, however, the jurisdiction is a special one, and if the subject-matter, to which the Act of 1806 relates, were gone — had ceased to be — the board of property had no jurisdiction, no more than they would have over any other subject not intrusted to their discretion.</p>
