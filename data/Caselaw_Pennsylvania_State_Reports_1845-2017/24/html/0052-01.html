W. Downey, for refusing to transfer ten shares of the stock of the Farmers’ and Drovers’ Bank of Waynesburg, claimed by the plaintiff. In 1844 Clymer held two judgments against Lot Lantz, amounting to about $ 150, and Downey was his attorney to collect them. He issued execution attachments, and the above-mentioned bank-stock was sold thereon, and purchased by Downey for $22, and tons-<a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>ferred to bim on the books of the bank in March, 1844. At the time of the sale the stock was worth $875, and it was alleged that the low price of the sale arose from the fact that Lantz was in debt to the bank, and this debt was a lien on the stock, and that this debt was paid by Downey, amounting to $229.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b51-4" data-blocks='[["BL_51.4",51,[137,642,1164,517]]]'>In March, 1848, Olymer made an agreement purporting to assign the stock to Jonathan Garard, who shortly afterwards demanded of Downey to transfer it to him, which was refused; Downey offering, however, to account to the plaintiff for the amount of the judgment on which the stock was sold. The defendant by his plea, and in his tenth point, relied upon the statute of limitations, and the Court held that it furnished him no protection. On the trial, the plaintiff was permitted to amend by making John Clymer plaintiff for the use of Garard, and obtained a verdict and judgment for $320, and the defendant sued out this writ of error. The argument in this Court was limited to these two points.</p>

The statutes of 1846 and 1852 are certainly broad enough, especially under the liberal construction to which, as remedial statutes, they are entitled, to cover such professional blunders, and there are many decisions and other statutes speaking the same language: Act 24th March, 1818, s. 7: <em>Brightly’s Purdon </em>19, § 2; 13 <em>State Rep. </em>60; 14 <em>Id. </em>69; 11 <em>Id. </em>147; 6 <em>Id. </em>377; <a href="/watts-serg/6/0046-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 46" data-case-ids="480171" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0046-01">6 <em>W. &amp; </em>S. 46</a>.</p>
    <p id="b51-9" data-blocks='[["BL_51.11",51,[140,1758,1161,300]]]'>Our next question is, in a case where an attorney, on a process issued by him for his client, purchases bank-stock of the defendant for less than his client’s claim, and takes the title in his own name, does the statute of limitations begin to run against the client’s right to claim the purchase as a trust for him, from the date of the purchase, or does it not begin to run until the client is notified of the purchase ?</p>

The statute however speaks no ambiguous language, but requires the time to count from the accruing of the action. It has been suggested that an attorney ought to be an exception to this rule; else he may gain <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>by his own negligence and even dishonesty. But when we notice that all actions on the case, including such elements as fraud, deceit, malice, conspiracy, wrongful conversion, negligence, slander, libel, nuisance, &amp;c., are within the very terms of the statute, we do not readily perceive how mere negligence can make a case an exception, as not embraced within its spirit.</p>
    <p id="b52-6" data-blocks='[["BL_52.4",52,[331,675,1163,424]]]'>It is, therefore, quite in harmony with the statute that it is decided that the limitation runs in favor of an attorney from his negligence or other breach of duty, and not merely from the consequences or discovery of it: 6 <em>Eng.
