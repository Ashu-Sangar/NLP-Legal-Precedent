On the morning of the day on which the accident happened, the machine was placed on the single track below the centre casting; and in the afternoon it was removed to one of the tracks, about 25 or 80 feet above the <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>centre casting, and between it and tbe bridge. The machine was fastened to the road by wedges. The plaintiff had been working at the station during several weeks, and knew that the defendants’ train ran over the track, and the usual time of running. The machine belonged to the Reading Company, and Burns testified that his instructions were to cut the wood wherever the agents of the company delivered it.</p>

Also, that the machine might have been observed, and the noise made by it in the process of sawing might have been heard, and that the bridge was crossed in a careless or incautious manner, the rails at the time being wet and slippery; and that the conductor in excuse said he had <em>forgot* ten </em>that the machine was on the track. Further, that the plaintiff was lawfully engaged at work for the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company; that the use of the track at the time was a reasonable use, and that the other track was left unobstructed; that the right of the defendants to use the tracks was to load and receive passengers without regard to any particular spot, and as long as ample space was left them for those purposes, they had no right to come to the centre casting if it was otherwise obstructed.

The plaintiff was not a passenger, and the defendants had assumed no responsibility, express or implied, for his- safety. According to his own showing, he was engaged in sawing wood with a steam sawing machine, screwed and. wedged to the very rail which he knew the defendants were accustomed to travel with their locomotive and trains. The Court ruled that he was lawfully there. We are obliged to say that he was not. He had the authority of Burns, an agent of the Reading Railroad Company, for whom he .was sawing wmod; but it was in clear proof that Burns had no express authority to put him there. And what if he had? Neither.Nicolls, the superintendent, nor <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>the Reading Railroad Company itself, had any right to fix such a nuisance on that track. The Reading Railroad Company built the track as a public highway, and the Little Schuylkill Company had, by express contract, the right of passage upon it, but neither company might obstruct the other. It would have been an abuse of their charter powers to authorize machinery to be fastened to the rail for sawing wood, or any other similar purpose. It is of the utmost moment to human safety that railway tracks should be kept clear of all manner of obstructions, and used only for the purposes for which they were constructed. The employees, whether authorized or not, have no more right than strangers to pervert them from their original design, and devote them to other than the great public objects which bring them into existence. If machinery to saw wood may be erected on rails designed for public travel, other establishments, more or less necessary to the business of railroads, may be also, and thus the perils of travel, already great enough, will be infinitely increased. Until the legislature shall authorize the construction of railroads for something else than travel and transportation, we shall hold any use of them for other purposes to be unlawful, if not, indeed, a public offence punishable by indictment.</p>

If, therefore, a man plants himself on the rail, he must not expect the law to do more for him than to punish wanton injury. If he be injured from the ordinary pursuit of the company’s legalized business, let him blame his own rashness and’ folly.</p>

The parties being mutually in fault, there can be no apportionment of the damages. The law has no scales to determine in such cases whose wrong-doing weighed most in the compound that occasioned the mischief. A distinction is sometimes taken between proximate and remote causes of the injury &gt; but here it is so evident that the imprudence of the plaintiff was the immediate cause of the injury, that 'he cannot recover, even if the injury were in part directly ascribable to negligence on the part of the defendants.</p>
