The principle that, so long as anything remains to be done to ascertain the price, quantity, or quality of the thing sold, the title does not pass, has its origin almost entirely in the sense of justice that protects unpaid vendors against the fraud or failure of their vendees ; and very slight circumstances, showing any remaining control in the vendor, will be allowed to prevail in such cases. The meaning is that, so long as any of these things remain to be done, an unpaid vendor, who is in danger of losing the price, may rescind the sale: 8 <em>East </em>614; 12 <em>Id. </em>614; 13 <em>Id. </em>522; 5 <em>Taunt. </em>176; 2 <em>M. </em>&amp; <em>Sel. </em>397; 2 <em>Barn. &amp; C. </em>540; 6 <em>Man. &amp; Gr. </em>963; 7 <em>Id. </em>360; <a href="/wend/7/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Wend. 404" data-case-ids="2009623" data-case-paths="/wend/7/0404-01">7 <em>Wend. </em>404</a>; 17 <em><a href="/wend/7/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Wend. 404" data-case-ids="2009623" data-case-paths="/wend/7/0404-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/wend/7/0404-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Wend. 404" data-case-ids="2009623" data-case-paths="/wend/7/0404-01">504</a>; <a href="/mass/23/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Pick. 280" data-case-ids="2011537" data-case-paths="/mass/23/0282-01">6 <em>Pick. </em>280</a>; 20 <em><a href="/mass/23/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Pick. 280" data-case-ids="2011537" data-case-paths="/mass/23/0282-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/mass/23/0282-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Pick. 280" data-case-ids="2011537" data-case-paths="/mass/23/0282-01">280</a>; 10 <em>Id. </em>522; <a href="/johns/15/0349-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="15 Johns. 349" data-case-ids="2141007" data-case-paths="/johns/15/0349-01">15 <em>Johns. </em>349</a>.

The words in the contract, “ we have this day sold,” would seem to indicate a perfect sale, and not merely a contract to sell, and therefore a vested title to specific metal. But the metal is described as “now at our landing, or that will soon be delivered there.” This raises a doubt whether any specific metal was sold, and seems to indicate only a contract to sell. It does not as yet appear that there was any at the landing, or where it was to come from. For aught that appears, any 400 tons will answer the description. It may be that the vendors had not any or so much on hand. If they had any and it had been stolen or destroyed an hour after the contract, we have as yet no evidence that would throw the loss on the vendees. We discover no definition of the subject-matter except as pig metal. The true reading of the contract would therefore seem to be, “ we have bargained with Winslow, Lanier &amp; Co., to deliver to them at our landing 400 tons of pig metal.” Still we do not say that there can be no evidence that there was a defined lot of metal in the intention of the parties. We see none on this record. And especially we do not see how this metal, which was on its way to Pittsburgh, can, without other evidence, be embraced by the contract.</p>

As to Brenneman’s title, the learned judge charged, that where the same thing is sold to two different persons, by contracts equally valid, and the second vendee is without notice of the first sale, he who first obtains possession is entitled to the property; and this is correct: <a href="/citations/?q=17%20Mass.%20110" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="17 Mass. 110">17 <em>Mass. </em>110</a>; 12 <em>Id. </em>54; 17 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>99; <a href="/aik/2/0115-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="2 Aik. 115" data-case-ids="8544783" data-case-paths="/aik/2/0115-01">2 <em>Aik. </em>115</a>; 2 <em>Shepley </em>116.
