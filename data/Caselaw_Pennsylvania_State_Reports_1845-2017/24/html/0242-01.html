Pleas, not guilty, and former recovery. The suit was brought by Zane against Simes &amp; Co., in March, and tried on the <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>1st November, 1853. On the trial, the plaintiff below gave in evidence the receipt of the defendants for segars, <em>“ </em>as collateral security for the payment of $416 in sixty days” from the date, 20th August, 1851; and then called witnesses, who testified that on the 24th March, 1852, the plaintiff had demanded a settlement fronj the defendants, and failed to obtain it; and that, on the 7th December, 1852, he had demanded a return of the segars, and they were refused. He further gave evidence that, in the fall of 1851, the defendants commenced selling the segars by retail, and sold some of them at prices varying from one to six cents apiece. It seems also that the plaintiff below further gave in evidence the record of a former action in the same Court, brought by Simes &amp; Co. against Zane on the 16th March, and tried on the 3d December, 1852, wherein Simes &amp; Co. claimed the amount of a bill of exchange, $60.80; and also the loan of $416, which the segars were intended to secure; that to that claim Zane pleaded payment; and there was a general verdict 'in his favor, and a judgment entered thereon. And here the plaintiff rested.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b241-4" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[149,1211,1170,213]]]'>The defendants, Simes &amp; Co., then called witnesses, who gave evidence tending to show that the defence in the former action was founded upon the pledge of the segars, and upon the sale of them by the defendants; and also that the segars were not worth more than from $5 to $7 per thousand.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b241-5" data-blocks='[["BL_241.5",241,[149,1425,1168,215]]]'>On this evidence the judge charged the jury, that it was for them to decide whether the whole or only a part of the value of the segars was allowed to Zane in the former verdict, and this, was the matter complained of here. Zane obtained a verdict and judgment for $321.66.</p>

But the rule that prevents hum from splitting up his cause of action into several fragments, takes, away his right of action for the residue entirely. Having once claimed by action or defence a part of an undivided subject-matter, the law allows him no remedy for the other part, else there could be no limit to litigation. The instructions given below were therefore erroneous : they allowed the errors in one action to be corrected by a new one.</p>
