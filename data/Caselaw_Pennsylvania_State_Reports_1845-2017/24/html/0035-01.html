The agreement between the purchaser and the tenant, without the consent of the vendor, and without any right of possession derived from him, did not constitute an attornment in any proper sense of the term. “ An attornment shall not enure or work to pass any interest to make a bad grant good, nor to give a man a tenancy by disseisin, intrusion, or <em>abatement:" Sheppard’s Touch. </em>254. The purchaser had done nothing to acquire an interest in the land, and his agreement with the vendor’s tenant gave his claim no additional validity. The Court was, therefore, right in refusing specific performance, and in leaving the plaintiff to his remedy at law for damages for non-performance. These, he has recovered under the second count in the declaration.</p>
