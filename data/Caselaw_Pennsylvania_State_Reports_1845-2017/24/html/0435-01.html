The <em>lex loci contractus </em>furnishes the rule for its exposition, and however hard, and even unjust, we may consider the rule of construction, we are . not at liberty to depart from it, but are bound to enforce it. The principle is well established in nearly all of the Courts in this country and England, that where a bill or note is of binding efficacy as a contract, and could be recovered in an action by the holder against the maker or endorser when due, it may be sold in the market at any rate of discount whatever, without the purchaser incurring the penalties prescribed against usury. On the other hand it is equally clear that under the decisions of New York, where a bill or note is made for the purpose of raising money on it, and is discounted at a higher premium than the legal rate of interest, and where none of the parties whose names are on it, can as between between themselves, maintain a suit on the bill or note when it becomes due, provided it had not been discounted, the discounting thereof at a higher rate of premium than seven per cent, will be usurious, and render the same void: see Jones <em>v. </em>Hake, 2 <em>Johns.

There is nothing in the Act repealing, or even tending to repeal, the statutes of New York against usury. The person lending money at usurious interest, to a corporation, would still subject himself to the penalty imposed by the third section of the code, and to a criminal prosecution under the sixth section of the Act of May 15,1837. These laws are left in full force against the lender. Nor is there anything in the Act of 1850 declaring the contract valid in favor of <em>the borrower </em>— it merely prohibits <em>the corporation </em>from interposing the defence of usury. The object of the legislature appears to have been the punishment of both parties — the corporation for borrowing, and the lender for furnishing the money at usurious rates. The contract remains as it was before under the statute— void as to every other person.”</p>

It is a very special part of the business ,of the inferior courts of the United States to administer the <em>lex loci; </em>and they do so by both ascertaining and interpreting it as matter of law. True, the Act of Congress refers them to the <em>lex loci; </em>but it does not direct them how to ascertain it; and besides, it is not easy to see in the Act anything but a repetition of the rule of common sense, and common law, and international law, <em>locus regit actum ; </em>the law that presides at the making of a contract, presides at its 'interpretation and enforcement.

Facts, circumstances, and interpreta*tion, are, however, very often so complicated together that any attempt to define sharply the line that divides fact from law, the question of existence from that of interpretation, would require a refinement that would be utterly confounding to persons untrained to such questions, and would, therefore, be quite unpractical; and' in such case, the character of the' compound must be declared by the jury, according to those general principles, which always lead fair-minded men to very reasonable conclusions.</p>

If evidence is the means by which we discover facts, then contracts and laws in a foreign language, Turkish for instance, are not evidence at all to either Court or jury. It is their translation alone that is evidence, for it alone gives any light, and it cannot be used until it is proved, as matter of fact, to be a true translation of an authentic document.

The contracts of borrowing by corporations are, therefore, made an exception to the system of the usury laws; and, as an exception, it must not <em>be </em>allowed to infringe upon the system, further than is necessary in order to give it its proper and symmetrical position therein. It certainly does make contracts by corporations, to give more than 7 per cent, interest, valid; and we suppose that it makes them entirely lawful, as well for the lender as for the borrower. The declaration of the law is that corporations need no protection Of this sort, and the state will afford them none. Money lenders can have no undue influence over them, and the law does not interpose its suspicion between them in their dealings.</p>

If we can regard their endorsement merely as a contract of suretyship, then perhaps we may consider it as equivalent to a guarantee of the amount actually loaned with interest; and there are cases that favor this view: <a href="/wend/7/0569-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="7 Wend. 569" data-case-ids="2009736" data-case-paths="/wend/7/0569-01">7 <em>Wend. </em>569</a>; 21 <em>Id. </em>285; <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Hill%20472" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="4 Hill 472">4 <em>Hill </em>472</a>; <a href="/johns/7/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="7 Johns. 361" data-case-ids="369228" data-case-paths="/johns/7/0361-01">7 <em>Johns. </em>361</a>; 13 <em>Id. </em>52; 15 <em>Id. </em>44.
