A judgment for $74.76, with interest, in favor of <em>Killian Small v. </em>Charles Walter, was entered on the day of the sheriff’s sale, viz., 31st December. Whether the transcript, under which it was entered, was left in the office before or after the property was struck down, did not appear. On the 4th January, a judgment in favor of Joseph Schall for $23.28 was entered; and, on same day, a judgment in favor of Kurtz &amp; Nes for $18 was entered. These were all the judgments entered that time. The sheriff’s deed was acknowledged on 6th January. On 20th February, 1854,. an auditor was appointed to report distribution; and, on 7th March, 1854, Charles Walter assigned to one person one-fourth of any surplus of the sale which belonged to him; and, on the same day, he assigned the residue to another person.</p>

This is the truthful form of the so-called fiction that in such cases there are no fractions of a day. But this rule, by its very terms, does not apply to cases of conflict between alleged liens and <em>bond fide </em>purchases. Therein it may be necessary, for the purpose of simple justice, to ascertain the hour of the entry of a lien, and it will be done. The law divides the day where equity requires it to be done.</p>
