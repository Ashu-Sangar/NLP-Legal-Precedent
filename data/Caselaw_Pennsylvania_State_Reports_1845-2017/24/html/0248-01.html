William Morris, by will, dated 17th May, 1849, devised all his estate to his sister Mary O’Donnell and his two nephews, Wall <a id="p249" href="#p249" data-label="249" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*249</a>and Farrell, in equal shares, adding that “ at the decease of either, their part shall devolve to the survivors or survivor, provided the said Wall and Farrell have no heirs, and should the said Mary survive them, she shall have full liberty to will or dispose of it as she may think proper.” Mary O’Donnell died in 1853; and after that Wall and Farrell duly conveyed the lot, which was part of the estate devised, so as to bar the supposed entailment, and it was reconveyed to them, and then sold to the defendant. The only question was whether, under the will and the conveyances, the plaintiffs had a fee simple title, and the Court (Woodward, J.) decided that they had and decreed in their favor.</p>
