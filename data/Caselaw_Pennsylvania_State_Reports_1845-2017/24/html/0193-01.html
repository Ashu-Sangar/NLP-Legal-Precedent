When this is the case, it is not necessary that <em>the price </em>should be fixed, for the law will imply that he who performs the service shall receive as much as he reasonably deserves to have.” He added, “ In the present instance a conversation took place between the agents of the parties, in which the price to be paid for the use of the plaintiff’s booms came in question, although it was not fixed, and in which the defendant’s agent said that he would not use the booms, because they were full of logs. Subsequently, these logs were removed by the plaintiffs’ agent, to make way, it is said, for the defendant’s logs, which came down the river, and floated, or were towed by the defendant’s agent, into the booms. This, with the other evidence in the case, is evidence whereon the jury may find that the defendant is liable to pay for the use of the booms. If they find that the use of the booms was a business transaction as between him and the plaintiff, in pursuance of the previous conversation, they may find a verdict for as much as the service thus rendered was reasonably worth.”</p>

The instruction of the learned judge, as to what would constitute a contract, is unexceptionable. True, the contract must be express, but its existence may be shown by-cither positive or presumptive- evidence. It is said by the plaintiff in error, and this is the -burden of' his complaint, that there was no evidence of an express contract. The Court below thought there was sufficient evidence to submit to the jury, and we are not satisfied that any mistake was committed in this respect. To submit to the jury a fact, without any evidence of its existence, is error; but the burden of showing the error is entirely with the party alleging it. And before effect will be given to such an assignment, it must be most clearly established. The' Court before whom a cause is tried, generally speaking, have a much clearer view of the evidence given in the. cause than, a Court of revision; and the presumption is very strong that no question of fact is submitted to the jury, unless it is legitimately raised by the evidence. To rebut this presumption, we repeat, requires a clear case. 'Upon a careful examination of the'record, we agree wfith the judge of the District Court, that there was .evidence from which the jury might well find that the boom was used by the defendant, upon the understanding that it should paid for. It is unnecessary to repeat the evidence here, as it was concisely and accurately done by- the judge in his charge to the jury. No price was agreed-upon, but the contr'act was good without a stipulated price; and the evidence -which formed the first and second bills of exception was properly-received to prove how much the plaintiff was reasonably entitled to recover.</p>

The whole case depended upon the existence of an express agreement that the defendant should pay for the use of the boom, and, when this was affirmed, he had not the least chance of making a successful.resistance to the plaintiff’s recovery.</p>
