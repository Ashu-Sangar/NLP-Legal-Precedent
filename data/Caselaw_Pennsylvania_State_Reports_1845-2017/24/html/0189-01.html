Though the report of an auditor surcharging the accountant -with an amount for the good-will and fixtures of a tavern house if it had been confirmed by the Orphans’ Court, would not have been disturbed by this Court, yet after an issue in relation to it had been directed and tried and a verdict rendered favorable to the accountant, and decree made in accordance with it, this Court declined to reverse it.</p>

Though it was evident that a part of the expenses of the audit were in consequence of the misconduct of the administratrix, yet it being difficult, if not impracticable, to determine what part of the expenses were incurred in surcharging the accountant, this Court concurred with the auditor appointed to audit and adjust the account and report distribution of the balance, and with the Orphans’ Court, in charging the expenses of the audit against the fund. _ .</p>

After testimony was heard before the auditor, an issue was asked on the part of the accountant, to try whether the good-will of said house was of any value, and if so what; and other facts. The auditor, in his report and distribution, charged the accountant with $900 for the'good-will of the said house; but the Orphans’ Court directed an issue' to try its value, and the jury found - $124 as its value.</p>

In view of this difficulty we are compelled to do what will certainly, in some degree, work injustice, viz., concur with the auditor and the Orphans’ Court in charging the expenses of the audit against the fund.</p>
