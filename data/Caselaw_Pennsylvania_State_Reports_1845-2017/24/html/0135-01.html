There was no possession of lot No. 3133, the land described in the writ, the land to which the plaintiff’s claim is applicable, and the land described in the contract of purchase. The land occupied by the defendants was not known as No. 3133, and never was so called, except by the plaintiff. In such a case a Court of Chancery should not decree specific performance : 1 <em>Ves. Bea. </em>526; 1 <em>Parsons’ Bq. Oases </em>45-6 ; <em>Id. </em>95; 1 <em>Sug. on Vend. </em>385; <em>Id. </em>387. It is sophistry to say that there is no failure of title because the defendant got the land pointed out by the plaintiff, and all the title to-tract No. 3133 that the contract required. The contract required the .title to be applicable to the territory; a concurrence of title and possession : <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Binn.%20361" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Binn. 361">5 <em>Bin. </em>361</a>; 5 <em>W. f Ser. </em>51; 3 <em><a href="/citations/?q=5%20Binn.%20361" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Binn. 361">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=5%20Binn.%20361" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Binn. 361">390</a>; <a href="/watts/3/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Watts 367" data-case-ids="1841309" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0367-01">3 <em>Watts </em>367</a>; 5 <em>Barr </em>35; 1 <em>Bawle </em>376.</p>

If it were true that the Balltown mill property had been misnamed in the neighborhood 3133, the commissioners’ deed for lot No. 3133 is not a compliance with the plaintiff’s contract to procure their conveyance for the Ball-town mills and farm which are on lot No. 4821.</p>

The vendees saw the land, examined the lines on the ground, investigated the vendor’s title, and took it at their own l'isk. They got possession of the very land which they meant to buy, and which the other party intended to sell them. But the most of the land is described as tract No. 3133, in the agreement, as well as in certain previous title papers, whereas it is in fact within a survey, numbered 4821. The defendants insist that this error entitles them to keep the land without paying the purchase-money. They will neither rescind the contract nor perform it, and this action is brought to compel one or the other.</p>

We must therefore deal with that which the judge did say, without reference to the omissions complained of. The jury were instructed that although the vendees agreed to run the risk of the title, yet if the vendor was guilty of any fraudulent misrepresentation the contract was void, and he could not recover; and that, if the contract was made under a mutual mistake injurious to the vendees, there should be a deduction from the purchase-money large enough to compensate for the loss. It is impossible to see how anything better for the defendants could have been done. The jury negatived the allegation of fraud, and, by allowing nothing to the defendants for the mistake in the number, they declared their conviction that it did no injury. The vendees got possession of the land they bought with perhaps a defective title; but the verdict is conclusive upon us that the title would have been no better than it is if the land had been found to lie within the limits of the survey which was supposed to embrace it.</p>

They took the title at their own risk, and of course improved the land on the same terms. A vendee cannot improve away the vendor’s right to the purchase-money.

These defendants are not asked to surrender the land, and lose their improvements. They may keep both if they will perform their covenant, and pay what they agreed to give the plaintiff for the interest he conveyed to them. If it should hereaftér be taken by the owner of a paramount title, that is the very peril they promised to encounter, and at all events it will not be the fault of their present adversary.</p>
