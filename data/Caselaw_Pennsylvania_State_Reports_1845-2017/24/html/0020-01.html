On this account, it is very natural to presume that the testator intends to charge upon them all the deficiencies in the other portions of his estate in paying debts and legacies; and hence it is very generally decided that debts and legacies, not otherwise effectively or specially provided for, fall upon the residuary devises and legacies: <a href="/us/2/0131-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Dall. 131" data-case-ids="11737641,11737705" data-case-paths="/us/2/0131-01,/us/2/0131-02">2 <em>Dall. </em>131</a>; <a href="/yeates/2/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Yeates 294" data-case-ids="812672" data-case-paths="/yeates/2/0294-01">2 <em>Yeates </em>294</a>; <em>Prec. in Chan. </em>101; 1 <em>P.

Then we have no difficulty in understanding the testator’s meaning when he gives all his household furniture and personal property absolutely to his wife. He means it as a specific bequest (5 <em>Ves. </em>461), and that she shall take it clear of his debt; and the fact that he has charged upon it the expense of his funeral, confirms this view, by impliedly excluding any other charge. By personal property, however, he does not mean debts due to him; for the sale, contingently provided for, is not appropriate to debts.</p>
