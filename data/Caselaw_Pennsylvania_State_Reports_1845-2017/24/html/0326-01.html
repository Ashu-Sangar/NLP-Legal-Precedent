In the case now before ns the first declaration was <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>for goods sold and delivered; and the additional counts, filed by leave of the Court, were for money lent, laid out, and expended, and for a balance due on settlement. We think the latter of these new counts, if offered alone, would have been a permissible amendment of the original <em>narr. </em>But it was erroneous to allow the other to be put in. The <em>insimul computassent </em>may be only another way of alleging the indebtedness of the defendant for goods; but the loan of money must have <em>been </em>a perfectly distinct transaction.</p>
