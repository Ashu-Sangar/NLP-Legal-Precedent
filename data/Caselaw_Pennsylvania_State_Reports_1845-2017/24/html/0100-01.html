There are but two modes of delivery: in escrow; or an absolute delivery. The deed in question ivas not delivered in escrow. Any other delivery than in escrow, must be a delivery to the grantee in effect, though it may not be in form. The meaning of the term <em>delivery </em>imports a passing over. The right to the instrument must be passed to the grantee. In the case of Blight <em>v. </em>Schenck, 10 <em>Barr </em>290, it was simply decided,’ that the mere absence of the grantee at the acknowledgment will not prevent the deed taking effect as a good deed. To constitute a valid delivery, the grantor must, at the time, have parted <em>with all control over the deed: </em>10 <em>Barr </em>290. - Also cited 4 <em>Kent </em>455, note b; 2 <em>Jac. $ Walk. </em>573; <em>Shep.

In the present case, the grantee was absent at the acknowledgment; the grantor always claimed the land, and did not, in his lifetime, part with the control of the deed; he did not hold it as bailee for the grantee; therefore, his naked intention, without providing for carrying it out, did not amount to a delivery of the deed.</p>

There was no evidence that the grantee knew of the existence of the deed, much less that the grantor had parted with his control over it. He might have destroyed it, and no one could have gainsayed the act. At the most there was a mere expression of an intention to deliver made to a stranger, and which was never carried into effect. This was insufficient. The presumption arising from the acknowledgment before the magistrate, that the deed had been duly <em>“ </em>signed, sealed, and delivered,” was rebutted by the fact, that the grantor took the deed away from the office and kept it in his own possession. The case of Blight <em>v. </em>Schenck, 10 <em>Barr </em>285, is unlike this in more * respects than one. There the deed was left at the magistrate’s office for the purpose of execution and acknowledgment by an agent of the grantor and grantee, and, after it was executed and acknowledged, was left by the grantor in the magistrate’s hands without instructions. Here the deed was taken to the office by the grantor, acknowledged by him in the absence and without the knowledge of the grantee, and immediately taken away by the grantor. It was in his exclusive possession before, at the time, and after the acknowledgment up to the period of his death.</p>
