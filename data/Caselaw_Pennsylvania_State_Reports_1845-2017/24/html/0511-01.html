At the time of the sale <em>Isaac </em>II. Bechtel had a notice read under which he claimed the land as <em>Ms own. </em>He claimed it under a warrant to himself, dated 24th January, 1854. In the order of sale, an adjournment of the sale was expressly authorized, but none of the heirs present requested an adjournment, and the property was struck off to D. Sayer for $110. The sale was made on the 3d February, 1854. Bechtel was the husband of one of the heirs, and a trustee of another heir. A rule was obtained, to show cause why the sale should not be set aside, exception being taken that the price was inadequate — that notice was given of an adverse claim to the land; and that by the conditions of sale ten per cent, of the purchase-money was required to be paid immediately. The want <em>of terms </em>in the order was not specified as an exception.</p>

There were no terms of sale prescribed at the time the order was made. This was an omission which the administrator had no right to supply by terms of his own making. It is true that the Court after the sale could approve of the terms <em>nunc pro tunc ; </em>but they could disapprove of them also, and refuse to confirm for that reason alone. When a sale has been thus irregularly made, the Orphans’ Court has the whole subject in its power, and unless the conscience of the judge be satisfied with the result as being the best for all parties that can probably be reached, he ought to order a new proceeding instead of amending the old one. An appeal from the Orphans’ Court brings the entire subject <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>before us, and we may do ail that that Court could have done.
