It does not prevent the holder of á note from recovering from the endorser the true balance on the note, calculated according to the date of the actual payments, though some of those payments have been obtained after the ordinary delays attending the judicial sale of land and distribution of the proceeds. This is the general rule of interest, and the case of Carlisle Bank <em>v. </em>Barnett, 3 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>248, shows that the present case is not to be an exception.</p>
