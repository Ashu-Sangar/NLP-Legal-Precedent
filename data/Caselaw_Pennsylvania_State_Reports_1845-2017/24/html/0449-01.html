The plaintiff was the owner of land situate below the land of the defendants, and over the land of the latter the water from rain and snow ran to ponds on their land. More than ten years before this suit they stopped up the watercourse and turned the water upon the public road; but within six years before the institution of the suit, with the consent of <em>one </em>of the three supervisors, the defendants had the water turned from the road by a ditch leading it to the lands of the plaintiff.</p>

Pleas, not guilty, and order of the supervisors, and the statute of limitations. The defendants were the owners of land situate on the side of a hill. The water from rain and snow had, for fifty or more years, been conveyed along a watercourse through their land to ponds upon it. .In ordinary seasons the ponds were sufficient to contain the water; but in extraordinary seasons there was an overflow, and the water would run upon the plaintiff’s land. In 1844 the ditch leading to the ponds was closed by the defendants, and the water was thrown upon the public road, where it was prevented, by <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>slight elevations in the ground, from reaching the plaintiff’s land. The accumulation of water upon the road injured it, and in the fall of 1848, at the solicitati®n of the defendants, one of the three supervisors, another one of them having refused, consented to the construction of a ditch to convey the water from the road, and he directed the defendants to dig it. They dug a ditch two or three feet deep near the track of the road. It did not appear that they were paid for digging it. The effect of the ditch was to convey the water to the base of the hill, whence it flowed upon the plaintiff’s land, upon his meadow and yard, and into his cellar, and did him other injury.</p>

He observed, that the closing of the watercourse in 1844 was not productive of any injury to the plaintiff, but relieved him from injury in extraordinary seasons. That the supervisors, <em>as they had a perfect right to do, </em>authorized the ditch dug in 1844 to be constructed by the defendants, and for this act the defendants were not responsible to the plaintiff. That the only act for which they were so responsible was the obstruction of the watercourse. That that act was not immediately injurious to the plaintiff; still if, as its consequence, since the road ditches were opened, more water was brought down upon the plaintiff’s land, and more injury done to him than would have been done if the old watercourse were open, the defendants were answerable. He further charged, that the cost, care, and trouble of the suit were not to enter into the estimate of the damages.</p>

The right to divert water from its accustomed flow to the land of another, is an easement, which can be acquired only by grant, user, or a license executed.

The defence attempted by them was that the supervisors authorized the making of the ditch; but it is very plain that there is evidence of the consent of only one supervisor, and that merely, perhaps, to gratify the wishes of Stout. We do not, therefore, perceive that the defendants below were injured by the supposed error. The damage was simply charged to one of their two acts, instead of the other.</p>
    <p id="b450-7" data-blocks='[["BL_450.7",450,[331,1026,1167,685]]]'>Regarding the case thus, of course the statute of limitations has not had time to run, for the really injurious act was done within six years before the suit was brought. Rut even if we were to look to the act of stopping the sewer as the really injurious one, the statute does not affect the case, though that was done ten years before suit brought. The right which owners of land have to insist that the water of streams or of rain shall flow away in its natural or prescriptive course is called an easement or servitude, convenience or burden, according as it is regarded in one or the other aspect, the terms being truly correlative. Eléta, iv. 18, calls it servitude, and classes it as an appurtenance, and thus we learn that, as a part of the land, the right to it is not lost until after twenty-one years of undisputed interruption. 'The obstruction of the sewer was equivalent to a continuing nuisance to all who might be injured by it, and the statute runs only from the happening of each actual injury.</p>
