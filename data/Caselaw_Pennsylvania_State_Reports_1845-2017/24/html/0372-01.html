At the same time Cadwalader contracted, in writing, to loan to Montgomery $12,000, to aid him in erecting buildings upon the lots; but the money was not to he advanced immediately, but only in certain specific sums, in proportion to the progress of the buildings, the final payment to be made when the houses “shall be finished, and release of liens fully signed.” At the same time, and in consideration of the above, Montgomery gave to Cadwalader bonds and mortgages on the lots in the common form for the sum of $12,000, which mortgages were recorded on the same day.</p>

Is it- because the consideration of the debt is not set out in the bonds and mortgage ? The expression of a consideration, as such, is never necessary to the validity of sealed instruments. Rut the debt expressed in the bonds is the consideration and subject-matter of the mortgage; and, as subject-matter, it was necessary to set it out, and it is done truly; and the parties have, by their contract, created a lien for that very debt.</p>
    <p id="b372-8" data-blocks='[["BL_372.8",372,[300,1062,1166,514]]]'>It is said, however, that it was not properly a debt then owed, because the covenant, which was the consideration of it, had not then been performed. But this conclusion is very plainly inconsequential ; for a promise to be performed in future is one of the most common of all kinds of considerations for a present debt. The strict legal character of the transaction depends upon the form in which the parties have invested it; the bonds for the covenant, and the covenant for the bonds, each independent debts. How are they connected? Only by equity. If Cadwalader breaks his covenant, Montgomery may obtain relief in equity as against the bonds and mortgage. But he might not need this, for the remedy on the covenant might be complete.</p>
    <p id="b372-9" data-blocks='[["BL_372.9",372,[299,1576,1165,555]]]'>If equity interferes to change the form given to the matter by the parties, it does so for the purposes of equity, not iniquity; to establish the claim according to its spirit, not to defeat it; to save the mortgagor and his creditors from the forfeiture and from the penalty, and compel the creditors to accept the real debt and interest; to save him and them from any fraud or mistake, and not to let them gain an advantage by it. The relevancy of Cad-walader’s covenant is therefore only contingent. It might be important as a ground of equitable relief, but it has no strictly legal connexion with the mortgage. It is entirely irrelevant, except on the allegation that the consideration of the bonds has failed. Here it did not fail, and therefore the legal and the equitable aspects of the-transaction coincide.</p>

The Acts of Assembly simply require the recording of the mortgage. True, it was decided in Hamilton <em>v. </em>Ereedly, 17 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>70, that where the mortgage consists of a conveyance with a separate defeasance, the recording of the conveyance is not a compliance with the law, because by such a record it does not appear as a mortgage trans<a id="p375" href="#p375" data-label="375" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*375</a>action. But tbe sharpness of this principie has been somewhat moderated in Jaques <em>v. </em>Weeks, <a href="/watts/7/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="7 Watts 261" data-case-ids="1846900" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0261-01">7 <em>Watts </em>261</a>, by holding such a record sufficient, if the mortgagee is in possession; because this is notice enough to put people upon inquiry, when they may ascertain the true character of the claim. Yet such implied notice contains in it no indication of the terms of the mortgage. Of the same character is M. &amp; M. Bank <em>v. </em>The Bank of Pennsylvania, 7 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>335, where actual notice of the defeasance supplied the neglect of recording it. Of course these cases refer to the effect of such matters upon subsequent liens and purchases, for the mortgagor could not raise the question.</p>
    <p id="b373-6" data-blocks='[["BL_373.4",373,[167,895,1171,728]]]'>So in Garber <em>v. </em>Henry, <a href="/watts/6/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="6 Watts 57" data-case-ids="1846033" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0057-01">6 <em>Watts </em>57</a>, the conveyance contained a condition that it was to be void on the payment of certain sums of money, said to be mentioned in another agreement, but not set out in the conveyance. It was entirely imperfect as a mortgage, and in strict law it was absolute, for the condition was void for uncertainty, taking it by itself, and as it was recorded. Yet this reference to another instrument was regarded as sufficient in equity to make that instrument a part of the conveyance, and thus convert it into a mortgage; and therefore in equity it was a recorded mortgage, containing sufficient notice of a defeasance, which was substantially unrecorded. And such is the case of Crane <em>v. </em>Dening, 7 <em>Conn. R. </em>388, and there it is said to be sufficient that the defeasible character of the instrument appear, with such information in relation to it as will direct inquiry and guide investigation; and that it is no objection that the inquiries maybe difficult to make because of the distance of the mortgagor’s residence : <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Conn.%20396" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="7 Conn. 396">7 <em>Conn. </em>396</a>; 4 <em>Id. </em>162; 5 <em>Id. </em>449; <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%2059" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="6 Watts 59">6 <em>Watts </em>59</a>.</p>

This is to make the contract defeat itself; it makes it void from the beginning, because it is impracticable; and the houses can never be erected, because the first shovelful of earth removed creates a lien, that shuts down the coffers out of which it is to be paid for; or the laying of the first floor of joists on these thirty-two houses stops their further erection, because it creates a lien that cuts off the mortgage by which the money was to be supplied. If the owners of these liens trusted Montgomery without examining the state of the records, the law provides no relief from the consequences of their negligence, and morality does not demand that it shall, and even charity will not allow it at the expense of more careful men. If they did examine the records, then they found the lien of Cadwalader standing good against Montgomery, and honesty forbids them to cut it out for their profit. If they found it, and still trusted Montgomery without inquiry, then they agreed to trust him even with a lien against him of $12,000, and with no apparent means to pay them.
