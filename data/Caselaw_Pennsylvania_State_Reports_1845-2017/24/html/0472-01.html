Potts was the owner of two tracts of land, which was bound by a number of judgments, including two in favor of the plaintiffs. In 1845, a writ of <em>vend. ex. </em>was issued upon a judgment in favor of Lex &amp; Son, and one of the tracts was exposed to sale. A. Bunn, as agent of the plaintiffs, testified that he attended the sale, having been requested by the plaintiffs to bid for them. That during the sale, Belch agreed with him that if he would not bid upon the property, he, Belch, would see the judgment of the plaintiffs paid after the balance of Potts’s land was sold. The agent did not bid, and Belch became the purchaser for $2000. The property was afterwards sold by Belch for about $2800. After distribution of the proceeds of sale of both properties, there was unpaid of the plaintiff’s judgments above $500, and to recover the amount this suit was instituted.</p>

They sent their agent to the sale with instructions to bid on it for them. The defendants’ intestate was there also, and a bidder. ' He agreed to buy off the plaintiffs’ competition by a promise that he would see their judgments paid if the proceeds of Potts’ land were not sufficient for that purpose. Whereupon the agent did not bid, and Belch got the land at a price upwards of $500 less than what was sufficient to cover the plaintiff’s judgment. This is a suit to recover the difference.</p>

We all think it is. A debtor, whose property is taken in execution, has a right to have it sold for the highest price that it will bring. If two persons be present who are both willing to give a certain sum, and one of them pays to the other a portion of what he would otherwise bid for the land, the owner is cheated exactly to that extent.</p>
