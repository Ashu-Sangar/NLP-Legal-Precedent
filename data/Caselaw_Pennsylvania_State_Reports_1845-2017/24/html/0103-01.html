The justice was not bound to send up this record, for the writ did not command him to do so, and it is not before us in any legal sense. A <em>certiorari </em>against the Commonwealth does not give us jurisdiction to reverse a judgment of Henry Kirk against Valentine Speeht. We can do nothing but quash the writ.</p>
