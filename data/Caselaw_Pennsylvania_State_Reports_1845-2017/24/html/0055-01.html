They were out of the course of the com<a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>mon law — were special — and depended for their vitality on the provisions of the Act of 1850. The assessment of damages became a lien by virtue of no other law, and when that was repealed did the lien survive ? Had any private rights vested under that lien, there might be some difficulty about the question; but the lien was to compensate damages for the extension of Hancock Street, and if no extension, then no damages, and, of course, property owners had no vested interest in a lien created for their indemnity. This was very successfully demonstrated in Hampton <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 7 <em>Harris </em>333. There being no vested rights to guard, the principles asserted in <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Yeates%20395" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Yeates 395">4 <em>Yeates </em>395</a> and <a href="/watts/10/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="10 Watts 351" data-case-ids="1850924" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0351-01">10 <em>Watts </em>351</a>, are decisive of the question. The proceedings commenced were repealed with the law on which they stood; the attempt to prosecute them subsequently was <em>effete; </em>and the repeal of the repealing law left them as it found them, dead and buried.</p>
