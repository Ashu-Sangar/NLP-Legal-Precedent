A public road had been laid out on the division line through their unimproved land. Subsequently each party cleared off his land to the road, and put in a crop of wheat, and in the spring following each one built a fence to secure his crop, the fences meeting at the centre of the road, and obstructing it. It did not appear from the evidence brought up that the road had been opened when the fence was removed. A witness testified that he was one of the commissioners when the road was laid out. He added : “ After we were there, and laid.out the road, there was no act of any commissioner, to my knowledge, by way of opening the road. I think it was not cleared out or opened on the side of the hill where it was laid until after -the crop of wheat was taken off.”</p>

Tbe Court of Common Pleas rightly instructed tbe jury on tbe nature of tbe contract, and said in substance that <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>it was of no validity; but added, that if the defendant acted from motives of malice, or with the wicked and wanton intent to do the plaintiff an injury, then the action could be sustained. We think this was erroneous. The defendant took down a fence which he was not bound by any lawful contract to keep up; which he could not maintain except in defiance of law, and in the teeth of the public right-; and the plaintiff could not legally demand that it should be kept up, for he had no property in it, and no binding contract in relation to it. In such a case we cannot take cogni-sance of mere feelings and motives. These considerations may and do often aggravate the character of wrongs. Malicious motives make a bad act worse; but they cannot make that wrong which, in its own essence, is lawful. When a creditor who has a just debt brings a suit or issues execution, though he does it out of pure enmity to the debtor, he is safe. In slander, if the defendant proves the words spoken to be true, his intention to injure the plaintiff by proclaiming his infamy, will not defeat the justification. One who prosecutes another for a crime, need not show in an ■action for malicious proseoution that he was actuated by correct feelings, if he can prove that there was good reason to believe the charge well founded. In short, any transaction which would be lawful and proper if the parties were friends, cannot be made the foundation of an action merely because they happened to be enemies. As long as a man keeps himself within the law by doing no <em>act </em>which violates it, we must leave his motives to Him who searches the heart.</p>
