About 12 or 14 years before the trial, the plaintiff and one McGargy, the then owner of the land, afterwards owned by Dietrich, fenced a lane, each one putting up a part of the fence, and each keeping the half of it in repair. The lane was not upon the line between them. Subsequently Dietrich determined to fence off a lane by running a fence entirely on his own premises, and affording to Berk an open way, by removing the bars at the road, and also at the other extremity. Berk afterwards entered on Dietrich’s land, and supplied the place of the bars at the road by erecting <em>a gate </em>entirely on Dietrich’s land, thus closing the road, and thus serving to keep <a id="p471" href="#p471" data-label="471" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*471</a>bis cattle confined. <em>This gate </em>Dietrich directed to be removed, and this action was brought.</p>

But the gate had stood on the land of the defendant himself. It would be a curious breaking of a man’s own close which would render him liable to another person in trespass. The only claim or title which the plaintiff had to the <em>locus in quo </em>was a right of way over the defendant’s land, which he had enjoyed for many years, and does yet enjoy. His road ran through the gate in question. He cannot maintain trespass for the removal of the gate for two good reasons. In the first place, the act complained of was not a disturbance of his right to the easement, since he could use his road without a gate as well as with one. And, secondly, if his right of way had been disturbed, his remedy is not trespass but case.</p>

The controlling fact is said in the charge to be this : that the plaintiff assisted a former owner of the defendant’s land to <a id="p472" href="#p472" data-label="472" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*472</a>build a fence of which the gate in question was part, and that the fence was beneficial to the plaintiff as well as to the owner of the land on which it was built. If I build a fence or any other such structure upon my neighbour’s land, it is his, not mine; and the dominion-which every man has over his own property, gives him a right to remove it whenever he pleases. If it be useful to me as well as to him, and if I build it in consideration of his promise that it should stand there for ever, and if he removes it in violation of that promise, I may recover in an action on the contract the value of my labor, and perhaps for the consequential injury. On no principle known to the law can I maintain an action of trespass.</p>
