The protection of the wife is incompatible with the qualified power of alienation, as given by our statutes, and this applies as well since the Act of 1848 as before. By that Act the husband is entitled to a curtesy estate in the real property of his wife; though, by the Act of 1850, his interest is not liable to sale by execution during the life of his wife. The Act of 1848 does not free the.wife from the disabilities of coverture. Its object is not to enable the wife, but to disable the husband.</p>

This language, so far as it has been supposed to countenance the conveyance of her estate, <em>without the consent of her husband, </em>has been qualified by the subsequent decisions in Peck <em>v. </em>Ward, 6 <em>Harris </em>506; Ulp <em>v. </em>Campbell, 7 <em><a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20275" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Jones 275">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20275" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Jones 275">361</a>; Mahon <em>v. </em>Gormley, 12 <em>Harris </em>80, and other cases. The Act of 1848, as now understood, makes no change in the mode of alienation, although it does in the nature of the wife’s estate. A married woman’s estate can only be conveyed or affected either by uniting with her husband in a deed separately acknowledged according to the Act of 1770, or by some act of the husband, under “ a previous written consent of the wife,” duly acknowledged according to the Act of 1848. The object of the statute last named was to protect her estate from being encumbered or conveyed by her husband, or taken by his creditors, against her consent, and not to enable her to sell, em-cumber, or give it away without his consent. The intention was <a id="p256" href="#p256" data-label="256" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*256</a>that she should “own, use, and .enjoy” it. It was not necessary to the purposes of th.e Act, that she should be allowed to part with her estate without the advice and consent of her husband. On the contrary, such a construction of the Act would tend to defeat the wise and benevolent intentions of the legislature.</p>

It is, therefore, untainted by anything arising from the absence of his consent, or the presence of his coercion. The form of the conveyance stands entirely clear of objection. This brings us to the question, had she a clear estate in the land ?</p>

Post and wife gave her a fee simple “to the only, sole, separate, and proper use and behoof of herself and her heirs and assigns for ever,” subject to a ground-rent of $42 per annum. It is not necessary to consider whether this language in the deed would have deprived her husband of all interest in the land after her death. By joining in the conveyance, he has relinquished all his rights, whatever they may have been. With the exception of his rights after her death, the deed to Mrs. Hutchinson gave her precisely the same estate which any conveyance in the ordinary form of a deed in fee simple would give, since the Act of 1848. There is no trust created. There is no trustee appointed; nor is there any occasion for one. There is no restriction imposed by the conveyance upon her right to sell. It is not the case of a <em>power, </em>but of an <em>interest. </em>The deed from herself and husband to Haines is in due form, separately acknowledged according to law, and passes her interest. Ellis, the purchaser, consented to take, subject to the ground-rent. The title tendered is such as the contract requires. The judgment must, therefore, be in favor of the plaintiff in error.</p>
