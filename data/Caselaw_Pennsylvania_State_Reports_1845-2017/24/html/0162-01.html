But under the latter, it is said, such working must be limited to <em>“ </em>a reasonable and necessary use and enjoyment.” These words first made their appearance in the proviso to the Act of 10th April, 1848. That Act was supplementary to the Act of 29th March, 1822, which gave remedy by estrepement to owners of lands leased for years or at will, to purchasers at sheriffs’ sales, and to mortgage and judgment-creditors, to prevent “ <em>waste to the, freehold;” </em>but there was no attempt to define what should constitute waste to the freehold. The object of the Act of 1848 was to extend these provisions to tenants for life, and to give remainder-men the same remedies that landlords, purchasers, and creditors enjoyed, but the proviso was added as a saving clause, “ that no tenant or tenants for life shall be hereby restrained from the reasonable and necessary use and enjoyment of the land and premises in his, her, or their possession; and that the Court of Common Pleas shall have power to inquire into and determine the nature and extent of said use and enjoyment upon any motion to dissolve said writ.” Exactly the same saving clause in behalf of mortgagors was introduced into the Act of 22d April, 1850, extending the Act of 29th March, 1822, for the protection of mortgagees after judgment recovered.</p>

As the statutes do not define the legislative idea of <em>“ </em>waste to the freehold” we must go to the common law for .that, and then we understand all such acts to be forbidden by the statutes as at common law constitute waste, except they be such as are necessary, in the judgment of the Common Pleas, to the reasonable use and enjoyment of the estate. But, at common law, as we have said, the working of <em>open </em>mines by a tenant for life was never accounted waste. This was very <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>fully shown in Neel <em>v. </em>Neel, 7 <em>Harris </em>323.

    <p id="b164-4" data-blocks='[["BL_164.4",164,[327,549,1166,815]]]'>It is apparent from the Act of 1803, and' its supplement of 1833, that the legislature understood the working of open mines and quarries was not waste, for the first of these Acts having given plaintiffs in pending ejectments 'the writ of estrepement to prevent “ <em>waste and destruction” </em>the Act of 1833 defines these words to mean “ quarrying and mining and all such other acts as will do lasting injury to the premises;” but the proviso is, that as to quarries and mines opened before suit brought, the estrepement shall be dissolved on the defendants’ -giving security to the satisfaction of the Court for any damages the plaintiff may sustain. Thus it appears that, even after ejectment" brought, open quarries and mines may be wrought, the contingent interests of the plaintiff being guarded by security. ■ But, while the right of possession continues unquestioned in the tenant, there is no limitation or restraint whatever imposed by our Acts of Assembly on his working of open mines. It may, indeed, be doubted whether the saving clauses adverted to do not <em>empower </em>him to open mines and quarries, that he may have reasonable use and enjoyment of the premises, but this we do not decide, for it is not in the case.</p>

Are they entitled to estrepement ? The case admits that the mine had been opened and worked to procure coals for the use of the farm and for sale in the neighborhood, in the lifetime of Humphrey Fullerton. He devised to ■ his widow the one-third part of the net proceeds of the rents, issues, and profits of his real estate during her natural -life, and she having married Hughes, they sold to the defendants, a coal company, with a capital stock of half a million, “'all their right, title, and interest to the coal in or on the lands known as the Fullerton estate.” Under this grant the defendants entered, constructed a railway over the land, opened a new drift through the same, and were, at the time of the issuing of this writ, mining and taking and carrying" away coals.

We have shown that this argument has no foundation in the statute.

To deny a tenant for life the right to mine largely, would be to deny him the right to mine profitably — to shut him up to mining for his own fuel merely. If <em>he </em>cannot be restrained, and that <em>he </em>cannot was settled in Neel <em>v. </em>Neel, neither can his alienees. They possess his full right to mine and sell, and for these purposes to make new openings, to build railroads, and to supply all ordinary facilities. Nor are such improvements necessarily injurious to the remainder man, for the estate is liable to- fall in at any moment, and when it comes to him he takes it with all that has been added to develope and improve it.</p>

Should this happen, it would be no more than occurs in every life estate in chattels which perish with the using. So long as the estate is used according to its <em>nature </em>— in <em>formam doni </em>— it is no valid objection that the use is consumption of it; and it is no fault of the tenant that it is not more durable: Holman’s Appeal, postea.</p>
    <p id="b165-7" data-blocks='[["BL_165.7",165,[172,1841,1169,514]]]'>But if the objection urged be worthy of more consideration on account of the peculiarities of the great western coal field, it may be suggested that it is quite competent for the Legislature to provide for taking an account between tenants for life and those in remainder, that would do absolute justice to each. Similar statutory provisions exist now for tenants in common. It is possible indeed that the chancery powers already possessed by the Courts, might, by account, afford adequate relief; but however this may be, it is clear that estrepement is not the remedy, for that would deny him the enjoyment of the estate in the only practicable manner its nature will permit. This is the point we are called on to decide now, and it must be ruled against the plaintiff.</p>
