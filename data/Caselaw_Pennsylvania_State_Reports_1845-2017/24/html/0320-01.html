The principal is bound by the acts of his agent whilst he acts within the scope of the deputed authority; but if, departing from that sphere, or continuing in it, he commits a fraud on his principal, a <em>partieeps criminis </em>shall not profit by the fraud. A merchant’s clerk colludes with a <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>customer and discharges his account without payment, or on receipt of less than is due: — does anybody imagine that the merchant is bound by such a settlement ?

Such survey, plan, or description shall be taken to be a warranty on the part of the assured.” And, again, at the foot of his application the plaintiff stipulated that “ any misrepresentation in effecting this insurance shall be deemed not only a sufficient cause for cancelling my policy, but render the insurance void.” That there vas a misrepresentation in the description is not denied. The store was described as containing “ one chimney, one stove, stove well secured, pipe passes through crock well secured;” whereas there was no chimney and no crock whatever.

But it may be worth while to observe that this was a <em>mutual </em>insurance company, and that it is essential to the constitution of such a company that the party insured shall, <em>ipso facto, be </em>a member of the company. The Act of incorporation declares that all persons who shall insure in this company shall become members during the period they are insured ; and it gives them the right to vote and a contingent interest in the dividends of the company. The fact that part of the capital is held as stock does not impair the mutual feature. Then the principle ruled in Perrine’s Case applies, and the insurer becomes responsible for the representations contained in the survey. The by-law that was in that case was wanting here, but its legal effect was fully supplied by the plaintiff’s express warranty, whereby he took upon himself the consequences of <em>“ </em>any misrepresentation in effecting this insurance.” Through an agent of the company, of which the plaintiff became a member, he takes a policy, founded on representations for which he makes himself responsible by his direct engagement instead of his implied assent to a by-law, and thus he comes within the doctrine of Perrine’s Case, and the Court was in no error in applying it to.him.</p>
