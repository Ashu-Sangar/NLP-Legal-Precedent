No demand was made upon the maker, and no notice of non-payment was given to the endorser, but the Court below instructed the jury that the plaintiff was excused from making the demand and giving the notice, because, -after due diligence, their residences could not be ascertained.</p>

The notary testified that he had no distinct recollection of what he did in the matter, but he had no doubt he pursued his uniform practice, which was, invariably, when the residence of the drawer and endorser was not upon the note, to inquire of the clerks of the bank and look in the directory, and inquire of persons that he knew, to ascertain their'places of residence. He further states, that, being unable to find the drawer and endorser, he returned the note to the cashier of the Montgomery County Bank. This is all that was done, and it was clearly insufficient <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>to charge the endorser. It does not appear that either the Bank of Montgomery County or Daniel Fisher were ignorant of the place where the drawer of the note resided; and if they were it was a passive ignorance, which will not excuse the want of demand and notice.</p>

It will not do for the holder to put the note or bill in the hands of a notary at the place where it was drawn without affording him any information as to the residence of the maker, or that of the endorser, and then for the notary, without inquiring from him, to return the note without demand or notice.</p>
