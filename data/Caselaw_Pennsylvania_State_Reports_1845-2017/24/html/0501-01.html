Clark, upon a case stated, in the nature of a wager, for the purpose of determining whether the defendant had the right to continue to act as an auctioneer in the borough of Harrisburg, by virtue of a commission granted to him by the governor, for the purpose of making sales at public auction in the borough of Harrisburg of goods, lands, and other kinds of property not forbidden by Act of Assembly.</p>

J., observing that the employment was called in the Act of 1832, the “ <em>trade or occupation” </em>of an auctioneer, held that it was not <em>an office, </em>referring to the case of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Binns, 17 <em>Ser. R. </em>219, for the position that a distinction exists between a mere employment or occupation, though partaking of a public nature, and an office: and, stating that not observing in the repealing Act any design in the legislature to deprive the defendant of the privileges purchased, he was of opinion that the defendant had authority to sell goods in Harrisburg except so far as such sales were forbidden by the Act of 1832, or other laws prior to 1853.</p>
