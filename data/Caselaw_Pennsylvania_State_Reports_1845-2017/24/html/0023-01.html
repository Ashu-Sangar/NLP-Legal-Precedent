On the 21st November, 1851, he was indebted to Digby, in $2175.81, for goods sold and consigned to him, by Digby, at different times between the 1st October, 1849, and the 2d day of July, 1851, under and by virtue of an article of agreement between the parties, dated 27th September, 1849. On the 14th of July, 1851, Scandrett left Youngstown, for Lake Superior, on a trading expedition, intending to return in a few months; and he left his store in charge of his cutter and salesman, Goodman, and requested George McKee to superintend his business in his abseiice. At the time Scandrett left, the stock of goods remaining in his store was worth about $8000. Some time after his departure, Goodman, his cutter and salesman, left the store, and the business was then managed by McKee, who made sale of some of the goods, and otherwise disposed of a portion in payment of some small debts of Scandrett.</p>

At the same time Digby procured from McKee a mortgage or bill of sale for the <em>residue of the stocle on hand, </em>amounting to $689.26. In this bill of sale Digby was authorized to take possession of the goods upon the mortgagors failing to pay said $689.26 <em>within one month. </em>On the same day Digby took possession of the goods, and left them in charge of an agent, at Youngstown, Ohio, who before the expiration of the 30 days, removed the goods to his own (the agent’s) house. Part of the goods were sold in and about Youngstown by Goodman and McKee, and the residue were sent to Lake Superior, and sold by McKee and Scandrett for Digby.</p>

But it is contended on part of plaintiffs, that Digby is chargeable with that portion of the goods which was received by him under the mortgage or bill of sale by McKee, the superintendent of the store. A clerk or agent has no authority to sell by wholesale the goods in the store in payment of a debt: 2 <em>Harris </em>105, Hampton <em>v. </em>Matthews; <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Johnson%20362" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="18 Johnson 362">18 <em>Johnson </em>362</a>. The alleged ratification by Scandrett in April, 1852, about five months after the issuing and service of the attachment of the plaintiffs,' cannot affect any interest acquired by them under the attachment proceeding. Under the Act of Assembly, the garnishee is required to show cause why the plaintiff should not have execution of the effects of the defendant “in his hands or possession.” This does not mean an actual manual possession, but also the legal or potential custody — coextensive with the power the garnishee has over them — the jurisdiction of the Court being governed by the condition which the property occupies in relation to the parties to be affected. If the goods are susceptible of seizure, the sheriff shall seize them: if not susceptible of seizure or manual occupation, the sheriff is to give notice to the party having the custody or control of the goods, that he attaches them.</p>

The ¿potential charge or control of the goods in question by Digby, while living in Pittsburgh, by his agent in Ohio, was not such a possession as rendered them liable to be attached in Pennsylvania. If <em>Digby </em>had property in the goods by virtue of the bill of sale, this would draw after it the possession; but if <em>he </em>had such title, the goods were not liable to attachment as the property of <em>Soandrett. </em>Where there has been a wrongful taking of chattels, the property in them is not changed before judgment, but remains in the rightful owner : 2 <em>Kent </em>337-8, and notes. Possession is either actual, or that which arises constructively from title. If <em>Scandrett </em>were the owner, his property in them could not be reached by service upon Digby, who had not even the evidence of property in Scandrett.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b24-6" data-blocks='[["BL_24.4",24,[332,1062,1165,385]]]'>The proceeding by foreign attachment is one <em>in rem, </em>and to enable a Court to pronounce a judgment respecting it, it must be within its territory or control: 1 <em>Harris </em>223, Christmas <em>v. </em>Biddle.

If Scandrett had not ratified the sale of the goods, he might have maintained reple-vin. The plaintiffs were not without remedy, as they might have attached the goods in Ohio.</p>

It is true, that “ the attachment process is a proceeding <em>in rem;” </em>but it is equally true that it is something more. It is also a proceeding against the garnishee <em>personally, </em>for the purpose of compelling him to answer for the value where the thing itself is not produced. The summons, the judgment, and the execution contain the bones and sinews of a proceeding <em>in perso-nam </em>against the garnishee, by means of which his own estate may be taken in execution if he fail to “ answer interrogatories,” or “to produce the goods and effects of the defendant” found to be in his hands or possession, or “ neglect to pay the debt attached, if the same be due and payable.” The ultimate object of the proceeding is to appropriate the debtor’s assets to the payment of his debts, and this object is one which ought to be favored. It may be accomplished wherever the Courts have jurisdiction over the person who has the actual possession of the property, and the power to dispose of it according to their direction, or wherever the property itself may be taken into actual possession by the <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>officers of the law. Real estate follows the law of its <em>situs, </em>and bank stock that of its creation. Where the one is located in a foreign jurisdiction, or the other created by a foreign law, neither is the subject of attachment here, in the hands of one who has neither possession, nor title, but simply a naked power to sell: Christmas <em>v. </em>Biddle, 1 <em>Harris </em>223. But this is not the case with ordinary .goods and effects. In general, any one having possession of goods or effects may surrender them in obedience to a judgment in a foreign attachment, although they may happen to be within a foreign jurisdiction at the time the writ was issued. The possession of them gives the power of removal and surrender. While this exists in the garnishee, there is no reason why he should not he compelled to exercise it in furtherance of the object of the law, and in advancement of justice. It was thought at one time that a foreign attachment would not lie of a debt contracted out of the jurisdiction: 2 <em>Show. </em>373; <em>Lord Raym. </em>346. But this was afterwards denied, and it was held that the debt always follows the person of the debtor, and it is not material where it was contracted: Andrews <em>v. </em>Clerke, <em>Carthew </em>25. In personal property, the <em>lex loci rei sitce </em>is not to be recognised. All that is requisite to sustain the proceedings against the garnishee is, that he be within the jurisdiction of the Court when the writ is served, and that the property attached be “ in his hands or possession.” The Court was in error in directing the jury that the attachment would not lie for goods delivered to Digby in Ohio.</p>
    <p id="b25-4" data-blocks='[["BL_25.4",25,[156,1506,1169,430]]]'>This disposes of the only point determined by the District Court; but as the cause goes back, it is proper to express our opinion on the other points.

But where an agent exceeds his authority, and an interest has attached in favor of another, a subsequent ratification will not divest such interest: 5 <em>East </em>491.
