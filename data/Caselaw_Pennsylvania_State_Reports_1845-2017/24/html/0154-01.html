That notwithstanding the sale made by defendant to De Normandie in March, 1851, was <em>rescinded </em>before this suit was-instituted, yet that such sale amounted to such a repudiation of <em>the trust </em>as authorized the plaintiff’s intestate to consider the trust as annulled. 5.

This instruction-, said the Court, is, however, predicated upon the good faith of the trustee; for if you find from the evidence that he denied the trust, refused to execute it, and claimed the property as his own,-or' sold it without the consent of the personal representative, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover in this action before he had realized from the sale the amount claimed by the plaintiff.</p>
