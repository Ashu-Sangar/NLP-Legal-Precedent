Errors not assigned according to that rule are considered as waived. There is no specification of any particular error in this case. The general error assigned setting forth that “ the Court erred in confirming the auditor’s report,” is not sufficient to indicate the point intended to be raised. The decree must, therefore, be affirmed for want of an assignment of error according to the rule of Court.</p>

      <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>But if we looked into the <em>argument </em>for reasons to reverse the decision, we should fail to find them. In Kittera’s Estate, 5 <em>Harris </em>422, it was shown that after a'contest between the legislature and the judiciary, the former had at last succeeded in establishing the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court “to appoint one or more auditors to <em>make distribution </em>of estates in the hands of executors or administrators, <em>to and among the persons entitled to the same.” </em>These general terms embrace <em>creditors, </em>as well as <em>heirs, next of kin, </em>and <em>legatees. </em>“ The right of each to be heard in support of his claim, and in opposition to every claimant who interferes with it, is necessarily involved in the right to demand payment out of the -fund. The power to decide all questions necessary to á proper distribution of the fund <em>follows the power of distribution, </em>and vests in the Orphans’ Court <em>as a necessary incident to the jurisdiction.” </em>This doctrine was solemnly ’affirmed by this Court, after the fullest discussion of the question of jurisdiction. We do not see how distribution among heirs or legatees can be decreed without previously ascertaining the amount of the debts. The power to do.this necessarily “follows the power of distribution.” We have no inclination to overturn the decision in Kittera’s Estate. If we had, we certainly should, not do it in a case like the present, where the debtor to the estate is himself an executor, and cannot be sued at common law, because the law does not tolerate the repugnancy of allowing one man to be both plaintiff and defendant in the same action.</p>

Even on appeal, as distinguished from a writ of error, they cannot be called upon to try questions of <em>fact.” </em>We might not have found the facts as the auditor has, but we see no such <em>flagrant error </em>as to justify our interference with the report.</p>
