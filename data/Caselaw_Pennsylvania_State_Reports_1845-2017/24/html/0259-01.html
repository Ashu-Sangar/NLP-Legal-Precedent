If the process served upon the defendant’s property do not compel him to appear, the suit may still go on; and even herein our processes of <em>sei. fa. </em>on mortgages and judgments, and of summons in covenant on a perpetual rent, as well as' our foreign and domestic attachments, are directly analogous. The peculiar style of the action is very convenient; but it is not intended or expected that the ship shall make any defence. Such suits generally proceed on the principle that there are some interests and duties to which parties ought to be prepared to attend by themselves or. their agents on a very summary kind of warning.</p>
    <p id="b264-6" data-blocks='[["BL_264.4",264,[317,930,1164,600]]]'>It is supposed that the foreign attachment, because it affected only the title of the defendant, could not affect the mariners’ liens for wages. But a lien is not a title to a thing, but a right to present a claim against it and demand payment out of it; and a mariner’s lien is such a right as can be asserted only by judicial process. It gives no right in the vessel until condemnation. Since, therefore, the defendant in the foreign attachment was the sole owner of it, that writ took the custody of the whole title, and then the mariners could not interfere with it, except by some direct application to the department of government which had it in charge, or to some superior one. The law could not take it for them into custody, for it had it already for another purpose, and therefore for all purposes to which any one might claim that it ought to be applied by the state.</p>
    <p id="b264-7" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[317,1531,1162,298]]]'>Were, then, the mariners’ liens gone by the operation of the foreign attachment ? Certainly not; for the law does not apply its remedies so as to do wrong to any one. The foreign attachment was a conditional sequestration of the ship, and it-might be released from the custody of the law either by defeat of the action, or by bail, or by payment of the debt, just as an arrest in admiralty plight be. Such contingencies attend all such seizures.</p>
    <p id="b264-8" data-blocks='[["BL_264.6",264,[317,1829,1161,512]]]'>In a harmonious system of government there can therefore be nothing to prevent a second judicial seizure of the same property, subject to the control already taken of it in a former case, even by a different tribunal. This is the constant practice in the service of foreign attachment and executions from the same Court, or from different Courts, and it is most completely illustrated in the case of executions issued by different justices of the peace, to different constables against the same defendants; In a very recent case at Pittsburgh, Harbeson <em>v. </em>McCartney, one constable attempted, by an early sale, to get ahead of a previous levy, by another on property not easily removable, and we corrected his haste, and declared the second levy subordinate to the first.</p>

This is the constant practice in relation to the liens of carriers, factors, consignees and landlords, and all others having the same right; for the law does not use its power to their disappointment. And this principle is a mere corollary of that which attributes to all judicial sales the effect of discharging all liens, and which was demonstrated by Chief Justice GriBSON: 3 <em>Bawle </em>126. And there is no matter of courtesy in this, but of mere duty, on the part of those who have to administer a system that was intended to work harmoniously.</p>
    <p id="b265-6" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[142,897,1168,678]]]'>That maritime liens and the United States’ Courts are a part of a more general system does not hinder them from entering into this intended harmony — they are still part of our one system. A generous confidence and courtesy between different, even judicial, functionaries, will not embarrass them in the performance of their respective duties; for certainly the forms of judicial procedure, like those of other business, are susceptible of some accommodation, and can be adapted under all circumstances to secure the end for which they are designed, and especially to the general frame of government of which they form a part. It is not at all strange for Courts to exercise a very large discretion, under extraordinary circumstances, for the purpose of giving their process an orderly, efficient, and equitable direction: <em>Eden’s Bankr. Law </em>339 ; 1 <em>Mason </em>409. And when access to a common superior is difficult, there is room for consultation and concession, at least as to forms.</p>

It is very much to be regretted that this was not thought of by either Court in the course of the cause. Since it was not done, we must now decide the rights that have arisen out of the conflicting practice.</p>
    <p id="b265-8" data-blocks='[["BL_265.6",265,[141,1930,1166,259]]]'>We have said enough to show that the whole custody of the ship was in the State Court, and that the mariners’ liens would have been protected there, had they been presented.

    <p id="b266-7" data-blocks='[["BL_266.5",266,[323,935,1161,427]]]'>And it seems to be really essential that this should be the effect of the process in its operation on personal property. The articles attached are often very numerous, and, when sold, are delivered to numerous people; and the process would do great wrong, if it should leave the lien on the goods, while it is thus scattering them to the winds. If goods were thus sold, it must necessarily result in a great sacrifice of property. A lien on a ship’s cargo or furniture would not be worth much after a sheriff’s sale, and they would not sell for much under a threat of an admiralty attachment.</p>
    <p id="b266-8" data-blocks='[["BL_266.6",266,[321,1363,1163,725]]]'>No doubt the property might be of such a character, a ship for instance, that it might well be sold subject to a lien; but to do so would seem to require a special order. Obviously these reasons do not apply to land attached, and there is no need of adjudicating upon its title. As in the case of an inquest of office for escheat or forfeiture, the principal fact only, and not the title, is in question. Yet the possession of land is taken under the writ of attachment, and the rents sequestered into Court, and the decree of the Court must be conclusive as to the title to them. And such is necessarily the case when a debt is attached; for the debtor is summoned as garnishee, and the judgment may be that he pay the whole debt to the plaintiff in the attachment, and not to his creditor. If the debt, shall. have been previously assigned to another person before it was attached, the assignee must, on notice from the garnishee, interplead and establish his prior right, or his title will be lost: <a href="/johns/20/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="20 Johns. 229" data-case-ids="2142391" data-case-paths="/johns/20/0229-01">20 <em>Johns. </em>229</a>.

By the execution of the writ the state takes specific chattels into its possession for certain purposes. In our practice this purpose cannot be reached in less than about nine nonths, and it is very apparent that this delay may be ruinous to many articles. The interest of all concerned in them is that they should be sold, and the state exercises her best discretion when she directs this to be done. This is the <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>means adopted to protect the 'interests of all who have any title to the property or claim upop. it, and their rights are transferred to the proceeds. Here again, if the sale should be of many articles, as it most frequently is, and if it should be made subject to all claims, except the one intended to be satisfied by the suit, it is very apparent that those claims would be most effectually destroyed by a proceeding that is pretending to protect them.</p>
    <p id="b267-6" data-blocks='[["BL_267.4",267,[140,727,1168,560]]]'>In such a case the government acts for the benefit of all, and its sale confers an absolute title.

The law is neither omnipotent nor omnipresent, at least in its judicial impersonations, and it does not intend that its favors, even to sailors, shall apply in all cases and under all circumstances.
