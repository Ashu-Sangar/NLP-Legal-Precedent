Where a cause of action is joint against several, it survives, on the death of one, against the others, and equity will not follow the estate of the decedent if he be a surety who has never received any consideration. The liability ceases with the legal obligation. But in this case there is no attempt made to charge any estate of the decedent except that which was conveyed or encumbered in her lifetime. Whether the mortgage be treated as a conveyance or as a lien, the estate thus encumbered continues liable notwithstanding her death. If the estate is held in joint tenancy so that it survives to the husband, her heirs suffer no injury by proceedings on the mortgage to foreclose it.
