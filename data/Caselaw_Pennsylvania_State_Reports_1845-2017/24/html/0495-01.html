On 21st October, 1851, the balance of the account amounted to $310, for which J. A.

A note under seal accepted “ when paid to be in full,” is not an extinguishment of the original debt, because of the terms of the receipt: <a href="/watts/4/0378-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Watts 378" data-case-ids="1842760" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0378-01">4 <em>Watts </em>378</a>. A mere note not.under seal is not payment unless received as such, and the presumption is that it has not been so received unless shown to the contrary; but it was said, that when a party receives from his debtor a sealed instrument for a simple contract liability, the presumption is that it was received in satisfaction: Stewart’s Appeal, 3 <em>W. Ser. </em>476. No suit could be sustained on the book account. No agreement, however explicit, would prevent a promissory note from merging into a bond given for the same debt by the same debtor; for to allow a debt to be at the same time of different degrees, and recoverable by a multiplicity of inconsistent remedies, would increase litigation, unsettle .distinctions, and lead to embarrassment in the limitation of actions, and the distribution of assets: GibSON, C.

The official bond of a receiver did not merge the simple contract debt arising from the balance of an account due the United States: <a href="/us/22/0650-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 Wheat. 650" data-case-ids="1421289" data-case-paths="/us/22/0650-01">9 <em>Wheaton </em>650</a>.

    <p id="b495-10" data-blocks='[["BL_495.10",495,[122,1322,1164,515]]]'>The sealed bill was a new testimonial and a new security of the debt, but was not the contracting of a debt within the meaning of the statute. The debt was contracted when the goods were sold and delivered. It was then the relation of debtor and creditor was established, and all the rights and duties of that relation attached at that time. We have in several eases of distribution permitted auditors to go back of judgments and ascertain when the debts on which they were founded began to exist; and where the fact appears on the record, as it does here, that the debt was contracted before the date fixed in the exemption law of 1849, we must withhold it from the operation of the Act in the same manner we have done in questions of distribution.</p>
    <p id="b495-11" data-blocks='[["BL_495.11",495,[121,1837,1161,118]]]'>But it is said there was a merger of the simple contract debt into a higher security, and that the only existing debt began at the date of the sealed bill.</p>

It always depends on the intention of the parties whether a merger of securities shall work a satisfaction or extinguishment of the debt; and of such intention we have no evidence here. This debt, whether proved by the judgment, the sealed bill, or the book account, is the very debt contracted for the goods sold before the 4th July, 1849, and therefore not within the purview of the exemption law of that year.</p>
