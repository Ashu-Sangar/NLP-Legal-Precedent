After tbe commencement of tbe building, Pharo wished some additional security for the payment of tbe lumber which was to be put into tbe bouses. Pratt agreed to give it, and Campbell &amp; Pharo agreed to furnish lumber to tbe amount of $1600 for tbe seven bouses, that being tbe amount of lumber supposed to be necessary for tbe completion of the bouses. Afterwards, viz., on. 29th May, 1850, Furness conveyed to Pharo a lot on Coates street, as security for tbe lumber. Campbell &amp; Pharo did not furnish the whole amount of lumber, but, in tbe summer of 1850, Pharo refused to furnish any more than already furnished, but did not then assign any reason for the refusal; and shingles were obtained from another firm.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b183-6" data-blocks='[["BL_183.6",183,[173,1417,1166,635]]]'>The judge affirmed the point, but referred it to the jury to decide whether the contract was to that effect or not; and instructed them that they might find from the evidence whether the understanding of the parties was that the lumber should be paid for as delivered, or that the delivery of the whole should be a condition precedent to the right to be paid for any part of it. He observed that the question was, whether the delivery of each parcel of the lumber created a debt, although a liability for damages existed in case the rest was not delivered; or whether the understanding was that there should be no debt until the whole was delivered ; that the receipts were evidence which the jury might consider in determining the understanding of the parties; and that if the money, when paid, was due under the contract, it went to rebut the position of defendants, that nothing was to be due till the whole of the lumber was delivered.</p>

    <p id="b184-7" data-blocks='[["BL_184.7",184,[318,634,1160,549]]]'>This raises the question, was the contract so incompletely performed that there can be no recovery on it ? Or more definitely, did the parties mean that the right to payment should d.epend upon full performance ? It is not probable, in a purchase of lumber, where- each load delivered is of use by itself, that such was their understanding. The Court admitted evidence of payments made on account of what was delivered, as indicating that the contract was not so understood by the parties, and this is thought to be error, but it is not. It is some evidence that the parties construed their contract differently from.what is contended for here, and it is right to take their construction. And we are not certain that we should have construed it differently without this evidence.</p>
