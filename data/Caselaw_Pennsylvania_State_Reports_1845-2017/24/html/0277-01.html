The evidence that this survey was made in pursuance of the warrant to Christian Kaup is by no means satisfactory. In fact there is no authentic evidence of any survey on that warrant. The testimony on that subject is not sufficient to show that an officer, having a warrant for <em>fifty </em>acres, with the usages and rules of the land office prohibiting the survey of a greater excess than ten <em>per cent., </em>had actually disregarded his duty so far as to include in his survey nearly three times the quantity called for by the warrant.

    <p id="b278-7" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[299,1060,1170,772]]]'>Where there is an actual resident settlement on a tract of land, we can readily see why this should create an equity in favor of all who have notice of it. Such a settlement was a favorite mode of acquiring title. It was encouraged by the state. It located the tract, fixed the period from which interest was to be calculated on the purchase-money, and furnished the established evidence of a contract of pre-emption between the settler and the state. But no amount of <em>clearing </em>and <em>cultivation </em>of vacant land, <em>without a residence on it, </em>and without intention to reside on it, gives any equity whatever. While the <em>residence </em>is on the appropriated land, the possession and cultivation of vacant land gives no title to the latter: Overton <em>v. </em>Gibson, <a href="/watts/2/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Watts 384" data-case-ids="1840122" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0384-01">2 <em>Watts </em>384</a>; Adams <em>v. </em>Jackson, 4 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>69. In this case the evidence of cultivation is so slight as to deserve but little consideration; and there does not appear to have been any residence on the land since 1829. After such a lapse of time, a title under the settlement laws would be lost by abandonment, and it would be the duty of the Court to say so as matter of law.</p>

In such a case, actual possession, without residence, would be sufficient to give notice of this equity, and thus to secure the owner from loss arising from the omission of the deputy surveyor to make his return. But the payment of taxes on the land, and the mere use of it as woodland for the purpose of supplying firewood, rails, and timber, furnish no notice to a subsequent purchaser even where an equity really existed in a prior one : Strauch <em>v. </em>Shoemaker, 1 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>174. But where the owner of the prior warrant <em>has no equity, </em>his clearing and cultivating the vacant land of the Commonwealth is notice of nothing except of his unauthorized intrusion upon the public domain. Like notice of a <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>void survey, it could affect tbe rights of no one, and therefore could not prevent a subsequent appropriation of the land: Hubley <em>v. </em>Vanhorne, 7 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>191.</p>
    <p id="b279-6" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[161,545,1176,1894]],["BL_280.1",280,[306,407,1172,602]]]'>This brings us to the question, what right has a warrant-holder, who has only agreed and paid for 50 acres, to include in his survey 136 acres 34 perches? Ever since the year 1767, the deputy surveyors have been forbidden to include more than 10 per cent, surplus in their surveys: Creek <em>v. </em>Moon, 7 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>335. Chief Justice TilghmaN, in speaking of the rights of an opposing claimant (against a warrantee who claimed 328 acres on a warrant for 150 acres), said, “ He never could suppose that his neighbor would endeavor to include double the quantity” designated in his warrant: 7 <em>Ser. R. </em>335. In the case before us, the attempt is to include nearly three times the quantity granted by the warrant. But the usage under which deputy surveyors were allowed to include an excess of 10 per cent, in 1767, was restricted by the Act of 8th April, 1785, and subjected to the proviso that the excess be paid for <em>forthwith. [Dunlop </em>155.) Under the law, as it stood when the plaintiff’s warrant was taken out, it was his duty to cause the survey to be returned within a reasonable time, and to <em>paj forthwith </em>for the excess. As the warrantee failed in these particulars, he had neither contract nor equity to support his claim. The Act of 3d April, 1811 <em>(Dunl. </em>284), directed the patenting of surveys having an excess <em>over </em>10 <em>per cent. </em>But this embraced only those which had been <em>theretofore u returned </em>and <em>received </em>by the surveyor-general;” and even in these cases the patents were not to affect rights which had previously accrued in favor of others to such excess. In the case before us, the survey was not “ <em>returned and received </em>by the surveyor-general” before 1852, so that it can derive no aid from that Act. Under the Act of 13th March, 1817 <em>(Dunlop </em>316), warrants of acceptance and patents might issue for a greater excess than 10 per cent., provided such surplus quantity did not exceed 100 acres, if the party procuring such return should <em>forthwith </em>pay for the surplus. But it was expressly declared by this Act that the patents so to be issued should not affect the right of any other person to the surplus “ which may have accrued by warrant or actual settlement <em>prior to such </em>acceptance.” Under the Act of 20th February, 1819 <em>(Dunlop </em>326), patents might issue without warrants of acceptance in the cases provided for in the Act of 1817. But the owner of the Christian Kaup warrant did not think proper to avail himself of the benefits of the Acts of 1817 and 1819. He might have procured his return of survey, paid for the excess, and have obtained a patent. His title would have been good if he had done so before the right of the defendants had accrued. But it was too late after the latter had bought the land from the state, paid for it, and perfected their title. If the plaintiff’s sur<a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>vey had been returned before the Act of 6th April, 1830, he might also have obtained a patent by paying for the surplus on or before the 1st April, 1831, under the 1st section of the Act of 6th April, 1830; but his negligence prevented him from deriving any benefits from that section during its existence, and before its repeal. The second section of the Act last mentioned, which is still unrepealed, restores the law to the condition in which it stood at the time the plaintiff’s warrant was issued. By the Act of 6th April, 1830, a greater excess than 10 per cent, was positively prohibited; and even where the surplus was <em>less than </em>10 <em>per cent., </em>it was to be paid <em>for forthwith, </em>on the return of survey, “ otherwise the same <em>shall not be received, </em>and <em>such money shall vest no title for such </em>excess, <em>any former laws or usages to the contrary notwithstanding.”</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b280-6" data-blocks='[["BL_280.4",280,[296,1009,1175,1408]]]'>The course of legislation on this subject shows that an excess <em>over </em>10 <em>per cent, </em>was contrary to the usages and the law at the time that the plaintiff’s warrant was issued, and that it was equally against law when his survey was returned, and when the defendant’s title accrued. Even if his survey had been returned in 1792 he could not have held the excess for sixty years without paying for it, if any regard is to be had to the Acts of Assembly requiring payment <em>forthwith </em>on the return of the survey. To allow a warrantee, <em>icithout a return of survey, </em>to stand on a better footing than one <em>whose survey was duly returned, </em>would be to encourage not only <em>negligence, </em>but, in the case of such an excess as is here claimed, would be offering a premium for a <em>palpable fraud </em>upon the public revenue. In the early settlement of the country there were many circumstances which induced the state to overlook negligence and delay in the perfection of titles; but as the grounds for indulgence disappeared the interests of the state have demanded the attention of her public authorities; and the later adjudications, as well as legislative enactments, show that those who neglect to procure returns of surveys and to pay for the excess of land over that called for by the warrant, must do so at the hazard of being postponed in favor of a subsequent grantee who has complied with the law. It has been judicially announced more than once that “ it cannot be endured that a person who has paid nothing shall be at liberty to hold the state bound for an indefinite length of time, while he himself is at liberty to reject or retain the land at his pleasure. Justice to the state requires that the rule should be rigidly enforced:” 1 <em>W. Sp Ser. </em>174. The large debt which the state has incurred for public improvements, and the burdensome taxes necessarily imposed on her citizens, render it necessary to enforce her rights ; and persons who wrongfully withhold from her the means of meeting liabilities incurred for their benefit must not complain if justice unexpectedly ovor-take^ them.</p>
