On the 30th December, 1854, the District Court of Philadelphia ordered the original judgment to be stricken off, because it was entered contrary to the- agreement of the parties.

This is the error complained of.\nThe decision of the District Court has been affirmed for reasons set forth in the opinion just filed.
