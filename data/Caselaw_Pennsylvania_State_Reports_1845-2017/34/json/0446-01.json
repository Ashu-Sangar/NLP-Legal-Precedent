        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nWoodward, J.\nThe rulings of the court proceeded on the assumption that the will of Thomas Tobin, the ancestor of both parties, plaintiffs and defendant, created a trust in his wife, for the benefit of his children and grandchildren, and hence it was inferred, that these plaintiffs (grandchildren of the testator) had a beneficial interest in the Fayette county farm, which farm passed to the defendant by his mother\u2019s deed, and which was a sufficient consideration to support the promise on which they sued him. And such is tfie argument in this court.\nGranting the assumption and the inference, still the defendant\u2019s promise was to be proved to the satisfaction of the jury. The action is assumpsit; the promise rests in parol proof, and that of the most unsatisfactory sort; the confessions and casual declarations of the defendant made to third parties, who had no interest that entitled them to full explanations, or stimulated them to understand and remember exactly what was meant. The most that could properly be-made of such evidence, was to refer it, in connection with the proofs on the other side, to the jury, to find whether the promise declared on, had indeed been made. If they should find the promise, then, according to the court\u2019s construction of the will, there was an adequate consideration for the .promise, in the interest-to which the plaintiffs were entitled by virtue of the supposed trusts .of the will.\nBut the court seems to have withdrawn the question from the jury, by telling them that if they believed the evidence, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover. There was, therefore, a mistrial, even in the view which the court took of the will. The case should have gone to the jury, to say, whether the evidence proved the promise as laid.\nBut there was a greater mistake made upon the will. It would be a somewhat nice question, upon the authorities, whether the words of the testator created any trust whatever; but not to debate this, the trust, if trust there were, was coupled with a power of appointment very expres\u00e1ly given to Mrs. Tobin: \u201c I will and bequeath to my loving wife, Lydia, all my property, of whatever description, both real and personal, with full power to dispose of the same among my lawful heirs, or grandchildren, as she may think proper, at Tier decease, or before, if she may wish to distribute the whole, or part of the same.\u201d Mrs. Tobin\u2019s deed of 24th August 1844, to her son Martin, was a full and legal execution of this power, so far as concerned the farm in Fayette county. Martin was a son of the testator, and therefore within the description of \u201clawful heirs.\u201d The deed was a disposition of this much of the estate, according to her discretion, and so the power was strictly executed.\nWhat interest, then, could remain for these plaintiffs in that land ? Obviously, none. . The trust was defeated by the execution of the accompanying power of appointment. It was as if the testator had given the farm, out-and-out, by his will, directly to ' Martin. Had the widow died without executing the power, the children and grandchildren might have alleged the trust, and then, the' construction of the will, in this regard, would have been fairly raised. But as the case stands, there was no question of trust in it \u2014 no possible interest in these plaintiffs, to be a con'siderationfor the defendant\u2019s promise. And as no other consideration is alleged, the promise, if proved to the satisfaction of the ' jury, would seem to have been nudum pactum. If Martin, seeing that his mother was clothed with this power of appointment, had promised, in consideration of her exercising it in his favour, that he would pay each of the heirs $600, it would have been a good promise, and he might have been held upon it. But then we should look for the promise as part of the transaction between the mother and son; and so far as the evidence is sent up to us, we should look in vain. We see no trace of it in the papers, nor in'the testimony of Brownfield, who was the scrivener, the subscribing witness, and the magistrate who took the acknowledgment. He tells us in his testimony, that the old lady wanted her ' two' married daughters who were there, Matilda Fields and Hester Monteith, to have $600 apiece \u2014 \u201c she wanted Martin to pay them $600 apiece, and she would make him. a deed for the land. Martin said, if they would sign him their interest, as heirs, he would do it. They agreed to do it.\u201d And accordingly, they made a formal written assignment to Martin, not of their interest merely in the Fayette farm, but of all their interest in their father\u2019s estate, both present and prospective. Martin\u2019s liability to these two sisters was thus definitely fixed; but not a syllable was written, or said, that looked to payments to the other children ' and' grandchildren of the testator. There was considerable estate, both real and personal, beyond this farm, and over and above the specific devises in the old man\u2019s will, and whilst the widow held the power of appointment, the interest of the respective children was necessarily precarious. Under these circumstances, Martin agreed to give Matilda and Hester, $600 apiece, for their chances in the whole estate; and very likely he was willing to do the same by the rest of the brothers and sisters ; but of this nothing appears to have been said, at the date and execution of the papers. Was it competent to overthrow and derange this most simple and intelligible transaction, by such parol proof as the plaintiffs submitted ? The declarations proved, probably, had reference to the transactions with the sisters, and if fully expressed and understood, would have imported Martin\u2019s willingness to give each of the heirs $600, for their share of the whole estate, as he had agreed with the two sisters. To apply such declarations, not to the whole ' estate, but to this specific part of it, would make Martin pay ' more for his farm than he intended \u2014 more than either his father or mother intended; for she told Brownfield, it was the old man\u2019s wish that Martin should have this land.\nWe think the evidence was entirely inadequate, to impeach the transaction between the mother, the son, and his two sisters; and instead of being adjudged sufficient by the court to support the plaintiffs\u2019 action, ought to have been rejected.\nThe declarations proved are not consistent with themselves, nor with the writings. , And it is not the law, that when parties have consummated a conveyance of real estate, on terms that are fully discussed and understood at the time, without any fraud or mistake, the allusions and' admissions of one of the parties made in the absence of the other, and to third parties having no interest in the transaction, can avail to change the essential conditions on which the conveyance was made. What passed at the time, may be proved by parol, to prevent fraud and correct mistakes; but if evidence such as carried this case, were tolerated, the most definite settlements of business would be only fruitful seeds of' litigation and discord.\nThe judgment is reversed.",

And on the same day, Matilda Fields and Hester Monteith, in consideration of the sum of $600 paid to each of them by the defendant, executed to him assignments of all their interest in the whole of the real and personal estate of their deceased father.\nThe plaintiffs alleged that, by; the will of the testator, the widow became a trustee for his heirs and lineal descendants; and that the defendant, in consideration of the conveyance of the farm in Fayette county, by the widow, assumed to pay to each of the heirs of his deceased father the sum of $600; and to sustain their case, they offered the following evidence:\u2014\nJohn Morgan. \u2014 \u201c Sometime in August or September 1844, shortly after the vendue (after the death of his father), I was over at the widow Tobin\u2019s; Martin and me walked over the fields, to look at some cattle I had bought at the sale. Martin told me he had bought that farm of his mother; he told me, he was to pay each of the heirs $600 \u2014 the two that were here he had given his notes (Matilda and Hester), and if the others had been here he would have given them his notes. Then he stated, his mother wanted him to keep young Moats his lifetime; she wanted him to have his maintenance out of the farm; he would not agree to that, but would give him the same as the others; he would\" not be troubled with him. This was the end of the conversation at that time. He, however, went on and made a calculation what the farm would cost him; he counted the six heirs, and said, that would be $3600, and counting in his own share would make $4200, which was pretty near what the property was worth. He did not want any advantage of any of the heirs; he said, his brother Benjamin might have the place if he would pay the same he was to pay; he said, he would then have three shares in the place, and that would be worth more to him than after he would pay out to the other four heirs; in the three shares, he counted his own share, and Matilda and Hester\u2019s, to whom he had given notes. That same fall again, Martin came to me and wanted to sell the place to me; said the heirs might be troublesome, bring suits, and break him up.\u201d\nJohn Stentz. \u2014 \u201c Sometime in the spring, before his mother\u2019s death, his mother requested me to go and see Martin to get her some wood or coal; I went out in the woods to him where he wa3 getting wood for himself. He said, he dare not go to his mother\u2019s;. that the rest of them had as good a right to get her wood as he had; he had taken or got the place from his mother, and was to give the rest of the heirs $600 apiece; said he did not make a great deal; taking in his own share it would be $4200.\u201d\nLewis Hunter. \u2014 \u201cA few days after Thomas was up here, December 1844, from Kentucky, he (Martin) told me he was to pay a part or all of the heirs $600; I could not say which, it is so long ago ; when he stated what he had to pay, I added it up and said it was near what it was worth, cash down; said he offered it to Thomas on the same terms, and he would not take it; he said he had the shares of Hester and Matilda, and with these two shares and his own, which would be $1800, he could do better.\u201d\nThe defendant objected to the admisssion of this evidence; but the court below overruled the objection, admitted the evidence, and sealed a bill of exceptions.\nThe court below (Gilmore, P. J.), after referring to this evidence, instructed the jury, that if it was believed, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover.\nTo this instruction the defendant excepted; and a verdict and judgment having been rendered for the plaintiffs for $1082.40, he sued out this writ, and here assigned for error: 1. The admission of the' parol evidence mentioned in his bill of exceptions. 2. The binding instruction of the court to the jury.\nJ. B. & A. Howell, Kaine, and Ewing, for the plaintiff in error.\nThe parol evidence was inadmissible, to show that the deed to the defendant was upon a different consideration from that expressed therein: 5 Rep. 26 ; Tillers v. Beamont, 2 Dyer 147; Clarkson v. Hanway, 2 P. Wms. 203-4; Meres v. Ansell, 3 Wils. 275; Preston v. Merceau, 2 W. Bl. 1249; 7 Johns. 341; Howes v. Barker, 3 Id. 506; Schermerhorn v. Tanderheyden, 1 Id. 139; Church v. Church, 4 Yeates 280; Cozens v. Stevenson, 5 S. & R. 421.\nBut the court was clearly in error in giving a binding instruction to the jury ; the fact of the defendant\u2019s assumption ought to have been submitted to them.\nVeech, for the defendants in error,\ncited Krider v.
