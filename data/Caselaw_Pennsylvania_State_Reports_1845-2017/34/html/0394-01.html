But we do not think so. To claim under those Acts, she must follow their forms; but claiming under the will, she must await its execution. • <em>R </em>requires all the personal estate to be sold; and claiming under the will, the widow must let this be done. We do not, therefore, look to the intestate laws for the <em>form </em>of her claim, but for the <em>measure </em>of it. She is entitled to claim $300 at the distribution, and so the court below decided.</p>
