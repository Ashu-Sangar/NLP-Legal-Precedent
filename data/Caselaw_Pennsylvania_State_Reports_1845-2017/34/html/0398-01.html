Why? Because the driver, that takes five cents from them, is liable to be prosecuted. Suppose it should be said, that the driver of the public conveyance may take <em>for hire </em>persons in and out of the city on Sunday, to attend church. How is the driver of the public conveyance to tell who <em>is </em>going to church and who not ? . He <em>cannot do it </em>— it is impossible, and because this is <em>impossible, </em>and if he should carry <em>some </em>that should not go to church, he would be liable to the penalty.

And if the legislature intended horses should not be worked on' Sunday, what right has any one to make them work? We are aware, that this mode of treating the Sabbath, and requiring a strict observance of it according to the <em>divine command, </em>is not fashionable in this day and generation.

Usually, the best argument in favour of a given interpretation of an old law, is to point to the usages of the country in its favour. Minds respectful of society admit such arguments cheerfully.

Our ~first law on this subject was the 36th of the laws agreed upon in England, May 5th 1682, which declares the purpose to be “ for the ease of creation, and that people may the better dispose themselves to worship God, according to their understandings.” The very first law of the first General Assembly of Pennsylvania was on this subject, and was passed at Chester, December 7th 1682. It declares, that “for the ease of creation, people shall abstain from their usual and common toil and labour, that they may the better dispose themselves to read the scriptures of 'truth at home, and frequent meetings of religious worship.” This law was re-enacted in 1700, and again in 1705, in nearly the same words. These re-enactments were, doubtless, rendered necessary by repeals in council. The English statute which served, in some measure, as a model for all these, was passed in 1676 (29 Car. 2, c. 7), and goes much further, for it <em>requires </em>people to observe the day, “ by exercising themselves in the duties of piety and true religion, publicly and privately.”</p>

Hence, funerals, as religious rites, are allowed on Sundays, and all the functions of undertakers, grave-diggers, hearse and .carriage drivers, and others; though such persons use such employments as a means of livelihood.

Yet this exception is possibly <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>expressed by way of precaution, to prevent a supposed, but perhaps misinterpreted Jewish law, from being misapplied to us, as though repeated in our law: <em>Exodus </em>xvi. 23, and xxxv. 3. Or possibly, the purpose of the proviso was, to save from the prohibition certain worldly employments, such as cooking victuals in bake-houses, boarding-houses, and inns, and delivery of milk; and cooking in families was also named merely to prevent a prohibition of it from being implied from the proviso, though not included in the general prohibition.

We recognise in thought, that law and faith, or law and religion, consist of distinct classes of principles, and are enforced by essentially different means; yet it is as impossible to make a complete separation of them, as it is to separate reason from sentiment in actual humanity.
