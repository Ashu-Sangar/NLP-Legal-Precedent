Mayer, as a witness, and offered to prove by him, that the note sued on was without consideration. That about June 1852, he, the defendant, employed the plaintiff to purchase for him two land warrants, belonging to the estate of Robert Morris, for which he paid the plaintiff $¡75, and the price at which he obtained the warrants. That in pursuance of this arrangement, the warrants were purchased of Maria Nixon, the daughter of Robert Morris, and assigned to the defendant in June 1852. That the warrants were located on lands in Clinton county; the survey returned in the defendant’s name, and accepted at the Land Office. That these lands were sold by the defendant to a person residing in Philadelphia, to whom he agreed to make a deed by a certain day. That on going to Harrisburg, for the purpose of getting a patent, he ascertained that patents had already been issued for the same lands to George A. Latimer. That subsequently, defendant went to Philadelphia for the purpose of seeing Heylman, who told him that Latimer had no interest in the land, and exhibited a blank <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>transfer from Latimer for the patents. That in order to obtain a transfer to him of these patents, to enable him to make title, he paid the plaintiff, Heylman, $300 in cash, and gave the note on which suit was brought. That Heylman acted as the agent in purchasing the warrants, and also obtained the title to these patents; that although issued to Latimer, they were virtually Heylman’s, and that Latimer had no interest in them.</p>

That Heylman acted as the agent in purchasing the <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>warrants, and also obtained the title to these patents which were virtually Heylman’s, Latimer having no interest in them.</p>

The defendant was entitled to patent these lands in his own name, and if his agent interposed, and prevented his obtaining them by procuring their issue to a nominal party, from whom he held a transfer, he was bound in good faith to transfer them to his principal for whom he had acted in the purchase of the warrants, upon which these lands were located and surveyed for the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b144-7" data-blocks='[["BL_144.5",144,[308,893,1164,598]]]'>The defendant being the owner of the land had sold it, and agreed to make a deed for it by a certain day. If Heylman had not intervened, the patents would have been issued to the defendant, and he could have completed his sale. By the intervention of the plaintiff, the title of the Commonwealth appeared to be in a third person, and the defendant was thus forced, in order to procure a transfer to himself of what really was his, to pay his faithful agent three hundred dollars in cash, and to give the note in dispute for two hundred dollars more. Neither the payment of the cash nor the giving of the note, was voluntary, but both were extorted from the defendant, and come within that class of cases, in which money illegally claimed and paid, has been recovered back, where goods, deeds, or papers have been wrongfully detained until the money has been paid.</p>

In Ashmole <em>v. </em>Wainwright, 2 Queen’s <em>Bench </em>937, Patteson, J., said, <em>“ </em>I should be sorry to throw any doubt upon the point, that an action for money had and received will lie to recover money paid on the wrongful detainer of goods; it would be very dangerous to do so, the doctrine being in itself so reasonable, and supported by so many authorities.” And Coleridge, J., said, “I never doubted that an action for money had and received might be maintained to recover money paid on the wrongful detainer of goodsand the same doctrine is recognised by Lord Denman, in Wakefield <em>v. </em>Newbon, 6 <em>Queen’s Bench </em>276.</p>

The principle has been applied to the case of overcharge of tolls (Parker <em>v. </em>Great Western R. Co., 7 <em>Mann. &amp; Granger </em>253), and to the exaction of illegal tolls (Chase <em>v. </em>Dwinal, 7 <em>Greenleaf </em>134), to an attorney withholding title deeds upon an unfounded claim of lien (6 <em>Queen’s Bench R. </em>276), and to a common carrier who had refused to deliver goods, without payment of an exorbitant remuneration (2 <em>Queen’s Bench R. </em>846).</p>
    <p id="b145-6" data-blocks='[["BL_145.4",145,[158,704,1171,475]]]'>The principle has been fully recognised in New York (Harmony <em>v. </em>Bingham, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Duer%20229" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Duer 229">1 <em>Duer </em>229</a>, and s. o. on appeal, 2 <em>Kernan </em>99), and by the Supreme Court of the United States in Elliott <em>v. </em>Swartwout, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Pet.%20138" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="10 Pet. 138">10 <em>Peters </em>138</a>, and is well stated in 2 <em>Greenleaf on Ev. </em>§ 121, in a few words: “ under this count,” says the writer, “ the plaintiff may also recover back money found to have been obtained from him by <em>duress, extortion, imposition, </em>or taking any <em>undue advantage </em>of his situation, or otherwise involuntarily and wrongfully paid, as by demand of illegal fees or claims, tolls, duties, taxes, usury and the like, where goods or the person were detained until the money has been paid.”</p>

The case of Kerns <em>v. </em>Durell, 7 <em>Mann. Gr. &amp; Scott </em>396, closely resembles this, and although the plea was held bad by a majority of the court, for not containing a stronger negation of the right of the plaintiff to detain the goods, yet Williams, J., says, “I feel a difficulty in perceiving how the plaintiff giving up goods, which he has no right to retain, can furnish a consideration for the giving of a promissory note;” in which his brethren would have agreed, if the plea had contained an allegation that the plaintiff had no right, or colour or pretence of right, to detain the goods.</p>
