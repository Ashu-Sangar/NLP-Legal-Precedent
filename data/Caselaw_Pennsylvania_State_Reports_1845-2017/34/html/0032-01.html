There was evidence that he had pointed out a certain hickory corner (now gone) as the boundary of the Harrison survey; and a spruce corner as the boundary of the Phillips survey. And in November 1830, he made a survey, for Abner Barnet, of the Cluggage improvement, which adjoined the Phillips and Harrison surveys on the south. He ran and marked the lines upon the ground, and gave Barnet a draft, according to which the land in dispute was outside of the Harrison survey. The survey made for Abner Barnet, Jr., on the 4th June 1840, included the same land as that made by O’Connor for his father, in 1830, and adopted the same east and west line as the boundary between that improvement and the Phillips and Harrison surveys.</p>

If he acted in ignorance of his rights, when he made the admissions and did the acts spoken of, then this plaintiff is not bound by them. The plaintiff is not to be affected anymore by the declarations and acts of O’Connor, made ignorantly, than the defendants are bound by the admissions made by Barnet to Yickroy, when he declared the land vacant, if he also was acting in ignorance of his rights at the time.”</p>

We are not warranted in transcending this limit, to discuss the question of original location, or whether those claiming under the title of O’Connor are estopped by his acts <em>in pais </em>or not. The points put to the court do not raise that question. It is raised here, but we cannot test the accuracy of the court below by what did not occur there, or by any alleged omission, unless it occurred after attention was called to it by the party injured. It is not error in a judge to omit to charge on a point, although material, if he is not requested to do so.

But all the points called for instructions upon the conclusiveness of the acts and declarations of O’Con-nor, by way of estoppel, without regard to anything but their own inherent force, and without alleging injury to supervening rights acquired on the faith of them.- The court very properly instructed the jury, that these acts and declarations were evidence on the question of location or boundary, and referred them to their consideration. The learned judge also very properly instructed, that if O’Connor “ acted in ignorance of his rights when he made the admissions and did the acts spoken of, then this plaintiff is not bound.” Nothing could be truer than this, in the absence of injury to supervening rights resting on them. We <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>think, too, that the court substantially responded to all the points propounded by the plaintiff in error — and this disposes of the several assignments of error in the case.</p>
