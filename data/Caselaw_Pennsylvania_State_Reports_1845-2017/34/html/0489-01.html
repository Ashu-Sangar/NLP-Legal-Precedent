If this question <a id="p491" href="#p491" data-label="491" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*491</a>can be satisfactorily answered from the evidence, the case will be free from difficulty.</p>

'The two subscribing witnesses to the deed, were the only persons present, when the contract was made, besides the parties; the grantors are both dead; the' subscribing witness, Holland, is the executor, and party to this proceeding; and Phillips, as a creditor of the estate, is interested to sustain the account of the executor, from whom he has received the money, for which the executor claims the credit, which raises the whole question in this case.</p>

We learn from him, that the contract was executory during the lives of the grantors. He says, that he was present at the execution of the deed, and the will of Nancy; that both were executed at the same time; that no persons were present but the parties before named; he says, Holland was the person doing'the' business; I was only brought in; all I know, was that Holland sprung the conversation ; he appeared to be doing the conversation very carefully; he wanted a surety from <em>Phillips, of his performance hereafter; </em>no money was paid at the time of the deed. Holland wanted a guarantee from Phillips, to do his part of the proposed different things, that Phillips was to give; Holland proposed that Phillips should give his note, and Phillips objected giving his note, as they might come against him, some time hereafter; Nancy remarked that she had all confidence in Phillips, that he would do all that was right by her; Holland explained what Phillips was to do for them in <em>lieu </em>of this property; that Phillips was to do, I understood, to do as he had been -doing. Whether Holland proposed to keep the deed, or Nancy keeping the deed, Holland took the deed away with him; nothing m'ore was done. In answer to a question, ‘ it was not agreed that any bonds, mortgage, or notes, should be given for that deed.’- In'another part of his testimony, he says, Phillips has told me, at different times, that if he did <em>not get the </em>land, <em>he </em>held himself ready to lay in a bill; that he had a book-account for the last twenty-one years, to meet this case, if he did not get the land.</p>

Morton says: ‘ I told Phillips the message, and that the reason why he (Holland) <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>had retaken the deed, was to make Phillips live up to his contract ; he said that he hoped Kitty would not think so hard of him, as that he would not live up to his contract.</p>

The deed was signed by the grantor and delivered to Holland as an <em>escrow ; </em>to be delivered to Phillips, after their decease. This contract became fully executed after the decease of Catharine, the. survivor, by the delivery of the deed to Phillips, and which was afterwards recorded on the 17th of June 1856.</p>

It appears from the evidence, that after the death of Catharine, the survivor, and after the deed had been fully delivered by Holland and recorded, an ejectment was brought against Phillips, for this land, by some of the heirs of the grantors, and which is still pending in the District Court in this city. With the real estate, or the permanency of the ejectment to recover the same, this court has nothing to do; it only became material to discuss the question of the contract in reference to the real estate, to show its bearing upon the claim of Phillips, against the estate for services rendered, both prior and subsequently to the death of Catharine McCreary. After her decease, Phillips made a claim against the estate of $700, for work and labour done. The larger part of this claim was for work and labour done during the lifetime of decedents. The balance for labour, washing, cleaning, &amp;c., after the decease of Catharine.</p>

The claim in one case is for the sum of $769.Olf, and in the other for the sum of $60.50. We know nothing of the agreement for the actions in these cases, except the entries made by the justice on his docket. Ho agreement for the purpose was signed by the parties.

The transcript further showi, that the referees, after hearing the parties, &amp;c., awarded in favour of the plaintiff, in one case the sum of $624.58, with costs of suits, &amp;c.; in the other, the sum of $21.79, and costs of suit. In each of these cases, the justice entered judgment. The transcript states that the plaintiff was not present when judgment was entered for $624.58; but that the defendant was present, ‘ and objects to entering judgment on the award.’ The defendant appealed from these judgments, which were regularly entered in the Common Pleas, but were afterwards withdrawn by defendant; ahd the amount for which judgment had been entered by the justice, was paid by the defendant, as executor, to Phillips, the plaintiff; and for this the executor claims credit in his account.</p>
