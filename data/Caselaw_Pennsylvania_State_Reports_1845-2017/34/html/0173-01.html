This act, which was carefully prepared by the revisers, in order to protect the interests of minors, expressly requires that the guardian shall, at least once in every three years, render an account of the management of the minor’s property under his care, which shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the Orphans’ Court, for the information of the court and the inspection of all parties concerned. These partial accounts, as they have been called in this proceeding, are not for settlement and confirmation, nor are they to pass through the register’s office. They may hind the guardian, but they can have no such effect upon the ward. On the arrival of the ward at full age, the guardian is required to settle in the register’s office a full and complete account of her management of the minor’s property under her care, including all the items embraced in each partial settlement, and the decree of the Orphans’ Court is made upon this final account alone.</p>
