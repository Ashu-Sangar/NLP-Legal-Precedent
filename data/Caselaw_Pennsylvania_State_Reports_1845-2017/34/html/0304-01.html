The defendants are in possession under the John Harris survey, covering the land in controversy, as we understand it to be agreed, to which survey they have shown title in Daniel Colclasure.

If they have, the case turns on the <em>effect </em>of the possession by Weakland, under James Ross, in 1853. The fact is clearly proven, and not disputed; and assuming that the service of the writ in the two ejectments did not operate to break the continuity of the possession, as the entry of Ross, and the occupancy in 1853, amounted to an <em>actual interruption </em>of their possession, it is fatal to the claim of the plaintiffs under the statute, unless that occupancy, or possession, as it is claimed to have been, can be considered their possession; or in other words — unless the jury believe, as the plaintiffs have undertaken to show by James Ross, that the possession was so taken and held under an agreement with Daniel Groft; that it was for their joint benefit, or, as the witness expresses it, in partnership. If this was - as they represented, and the jury so believe, it would be no interruption, that would interfere with the operation of the statute, in favour of the Groft claim; and the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover, if their continued adverse possession is otherwise satisfactorily shown; and if it is' otherwise so shown, the case turns here upon the credence awarded to the testimony of James Ross. Are you satisfied' that he took and held the possession for Groft? His statement is unequivocal and positive. On the other hand, it is alleged, that his testimony is utterly irreconcilable with his conduct — his words, with his acts. It is shown by his'receipt in evidence, dated 27th April 1847, that he had been employed and paid by Daniel Colclasure, to procure the title of the defendants to the land in controversy. Was he the agent of both parties ? It is further shown, that when Grofts returned to the possession, and were found in the house which had been left locked, he instigated Weakland to go to Esq. Litzinger’s, and make information for forcible entry, and accompanied him there. It appears fur<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>ther,that in 1854, Mr. Ross himself instituted an ejectment against Groft for the land. How all this is to he reconciled, if it can be,’with his testimony here, thát he- took and held the possession for the joint benefit of himself and Groft, you will judge. If the testimony of James Ross 'is believed, and it, with the other evidence, satisfies you that the plaintiffs maintained an actual uninterrupted and adverse possession for twenty-one years before the institution of this action, your verdict should be for them. Otherwise, or if the testimony of James Ross is not believed, you should find for the defendant.”</p>

If there he one element more distinctly material than another in conferring title, where all requisites are so, it is the existence of a continuous adverse possession for twenty-one years. The defendants asserted that there was a break in the continuity of the plaintiffs’ possession, and this they proved by evidence of an eviction, under the title against which they were claiming. They proved this fact, and that their tenant attorned to the recoveror in that action, in place of turning out. He did this under the pressure of a writ of <em>habere facias possessionem. </em>There was no disloyalty in this. It was not necessary to turn him out actually, before giving him a lease and accepting him as a tenant, which, all would concede, might be done in such an event. The surrender is equally involuntavy, when the attornment is the alternative of actual ouster. The tenant attorned, stayed in possession awhile, left, leaving no one in his stead, and with no view to a temporary, but continued absence. Then came in another tenant under the plaintiffs in that ejectment, and cultivated the place for one season or over, and at last, after eighteen months or more, the plaintiffs below got into possession again, by breaking open the locked door of the dwelling. All this <em>hiatus </em>was within the circle of the. twenty-one years. The plaintiffs, however, attempted to show that this turning out of possession was a sham, and that the attornment of the tenant, and the possession of his successor, were for their benefit, and continued their adverse possession. The court left the facts on this point to the jury, with the instruction that, if there was such an adverse possession as was required to give title, continued for twenty-one years, the plaintiffs were entitled to recover; but if otherwise, and the testimony of the witness, Ross, was disbelieved, they should find for the defendant. The jury did disbelieve Ross, and we think rightly too, and this, of course, left the plaintiffs short of the period necessary to give title by the statute; and the defendants had a verdict.</p>

It was, therefore, entirely proper, on part of the judge, to instruct the jury that an interruption in the possession, for a year, would be fatal to the plaintiffs’ claim under the statute.
