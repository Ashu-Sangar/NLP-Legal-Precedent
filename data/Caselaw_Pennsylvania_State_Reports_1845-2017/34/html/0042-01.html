It was essential to the validity of the proceeding, in any aspect of the case, to make the persons in interest parties to the record,’ and give them notice by due process. This court remark, in the case of McKee <em>v. </em>McKee, 2 <em>Harris </em>237, which was an ejectment involving the validity of a decree in the Orphans’ Court for specific performance: “ The anxiety of the law makers to secure to defendants a day in court, after due notice, so sedulously manifested, is but in accordance with the principle, that before the rights of an individual can be bound by a judicial sentence, he shall have notice of the proceeding against him. This is announced to be an axiom of natural justice and of universal application, by Marshall, C. J., in the case of The Mary, 3 <em>Peters’ Cond. Rep. </em>312. Such notice is indispensably necessary to give jurisdiction over the person of the party: Com. of Pilotage <em>v. </em>Levi, <em>Charlton </em>298; Jones <em>v. </em>Kenny, <em>Hardin </em>96; and it has been truly said that, without citation and an opportunity of being heard, the judgment of a court, whether ecclesiastical or civil, is absolutely void: Com. <em>v. </em>Green, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Whart.%20568" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Whart. 568">4 <em>Whart. </em>568</a>.

Indeed, its observance is felt to be so entirely essential to the preservation of individual right, and the advancement of social obligation, that no official endorsement is required to enforce its general acceptance.” The court proceeds to show that no notice was of any moment, unless the parties to be affected by it were regularly before the court as parties to the proceeding.</p>

In 1826, Edwin Lungren, of Chester county, purchased the Michael Carver interest from his heirs, as well as the shares of several of the heirs of George Carver, deceased, acquiring in all sixteen twenty-fifths of the whole interest, of which Casper Carver died possessed. In 1827, he applied, by petition, to the Orphans’ Court of York county, for partition of the estate between the heirs of Casper Carver, deceased, which was awarded; and the property not being divisible, in the opinion of the inquest, was appraised at $750. Situated thus, it was claimed by and decreed to Lungren, who held the share of the eldest son of George Carver, deceased, who was the eldest son of Casper Carver, at the valuation. The proceeding being consummated, Lungren entered into possession of the premises, and died in 1827. The property was then sold by order of the Orphans’ Court, for the payment of debts due by his estate, to Alfred Lungren, for the sum of $3000. His title was afterwards divested in 1834, by a sale on a mortgage given for purchase-money, and bought by James Lewis, and by sales on execution, at several times, as well as by sundry private assurances, it eventually became vested in the heirs of Thomas B. Coleman, under whom the defendants directly claim title. They, and those under whom they claim, have been in possession of the premises from 1827, until suit brought in 1858.</p>

That there was no statute of limitations to bar such proceedings, in the absence of adverse possession. 2. That there was no deed on record, nor possession by the Fousts, or any one claiming under them, so as to indicate any claim in them calling for notice; and that the mortgage by them to George Carver, was not constructive notice of title, to a purchaser from the heirs. 3. That at the time of inquest awarded, the possession was vacant, in fact; and in this condition, the legal title being in the heirs, the law deems the possession in them.

The able argument of the defendant in error, proved very clearly that the learned judge was accurate in considering the case as settled by the proceedings in partition. The Orphans’ Court had undoubted jurisdiction of the subject-matter, and consequently their decree was, when made, as conclusive as the judgment of any other court of record. Every element and requisite necessary to the making of the adjudication, must be presumed to have been present, when we are looking at it collaterally. The decree, therefore, awarding the land to the representative of the heir first entitled to choose, was a mode of conferring title, and until directly impeached, is conclusive, unless fraud or want of jurisdiction appear to deprive it of this effect. We find nothing of this nullifying character in the case. The act of the court became the foundation of a title unquestioned for nearly twenty years — and never directly questioned — during which time the property has once passed to a purchaser at Orphans’ Court sale, and more than once under process out of the Common Pleas. It then comes to be assailed by a sale on a mortgage dated in 1810, payable in twenty-eight years, without anything to show title in the mortgagors, with no payment of purchase-money during the whole of <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>this period, and for the seven years after the last payment fell due, before suit brought on it.</p>

The proceedings consummated, operated as an assurance by matter of record, and, being an adjudication by a court of competent jurisdiction, cannot be impeached collaterally, for anything, as has been said, but fraud or want of jurisdiction. This is settled in numerous cases: Herr <em>v. </em>Herr, 5 <em>Barr </em>428; Painter <em>v. </em>Henderson, 7 <em>Id. </em>48; Lockhart <em>v. </em>John, <em>Id. </em>137; The President of the Orphans’ Court of Dauphin County for the use of Groff <em>v. </em>Groff, 14 <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>181; McFadden <em>v. </em>Geddis, 17 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>336; Gratz <em>v. </em>Lancaster Bank, <em>Id. </em>278, and Lair <em>v. </em>Hunsicker, 4 <em>Casey </em>115. The Act of 29th March 1832, § 2, <em>Pamph. L. </em>190, in which it is enacted that the Orphans’ Court is a court of record, whose decrees, “in all matters within its jurisdiction, shall not be reversed or avoided collaterally in any other court,” was simply declaratory of the law as it stood, as abundantly appears from the case of McPherson <em>v. </em>Cunliff, 11 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>430, and in several of the cases already cited. We need not pursue the point. The court had jurisdiction, and the proceedings cannot be assailed for the alleged irregularities, as attempted here; the record of the proceedings was rightly admitted, and properly held to be conclusive.</p>

The proceedings there had never been completed, and no final decree had passed. It is difficult to conceive how such imperfect proceedings could have been thought to have been an estoppel, in favour, of the party claiming under them. Hence the remark of Mr. Justice Hustoií, “ that a party can make title to himself by filing a petition in court, any more than by writing a letter, is so absurd, that I cannot suppose such an idea ever was for a moment entertained by the judge.”</p>
