    <p class="summary" id="b81-7" data-blocks='[["BL_81.6",81,[150,754,1163,345]]]'>“ It is proved, and not controverted, that a steam-engine was attached to this mill, after the insurance was taken, by which the risk was increased; but, to avoid the forfeiture which would be thus incurred, it is alleged, that there is evidence from which you may infer the agent had <em>notice </em>of the erection of the engine; and further, that the agent of the company had <em>knowledge </em>of the fact which would affect the company, and the company not having declared the policy void, cannot now avoid their liability.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-8" data-blocks='[["BL_81.7",81,[147,1099,1166,560]]]'>“ If there is evidence in the case, from which you could infer, that <em>notice </em>of the alteration was given to the agent, this would 'avoid the forfeiture, and the plaintiff might recover. The evidence relied on to prove notice, is that of William Welch, who says McKeehan told him, in November 1857, that he had heard Sykes had an engine in his mill, and was going round to see about it. This is denied by McKeehan, who says, he did not know that Sykes had an engine in his mill, till after it was burnt. But, if you believe Mr. Welch, it would not amount to notice, or evidence from which you would be justified in inferring notice. If he merely heard by rumour, or in a casual conversation with an unauthorized person, that Sykes had an engine, he was not bound to act upon such information or rumour, and he might disregard it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b81-9" data-blocks='[["BL_81.8",81,[147,1657,1165,505]]]'>“ The evidence of David Fair is also relied on, to prove notice to McKeehan. Fair says, McKeehan came to his house in November 1857, and he told him, he saw Sykes’s hireling hauling a boiler past his house, and mentioned to McKeehan, that Sykes was' going to put up a boiler to the mill he insured. This did not amount to notice that a boiler, or engine, was put up, but of an intention to put one up. Nor is there any evidence that Sykes told Fair to give notice to McKeehan, after the engine was put in. We, therefore, say to you, there is no evidence of <em>notice </em>to the agent, such as would relieve Sykes from the forfeiture of his policy, by reason of erecting his steam-engine after the insurance was taken.</p>

Notice to the agent would; but mere knowledge from rumour, or information from a third person, not communicated to the company, would not affect them; and there is strong evidence by the secretary, that they had no knowledge of the erection. It is not made the duty of the agent, to communicate any information he may acquire from rumour, or unauthorized persons, in reference to alterations on insured buildings; and the evidence fails to show that the company knew of the alteration. In the absence of such knowledge, it was not their duty to declare the policy void.</p>
