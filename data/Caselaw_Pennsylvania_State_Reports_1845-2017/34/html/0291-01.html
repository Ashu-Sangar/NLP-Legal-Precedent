Land may be contingently liable for the latter purpose, though the testator had no thought of such an event; for the former purpose his will must show that he intended it. In one case, it is a question of charge in the strict sense of the term; in the other, it is a question of contribution among legatees and devisees; and when devisees take land by will, they hold it subject to this contingency, as they do subject to debts.</p>
