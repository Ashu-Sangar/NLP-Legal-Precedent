    <p id="b211-11" data-blocks='[["BL_211.13",211,[166,1267,1183,518]]]'>In this action to recover for a breach of covenant by the vendor for not making a deed to the vendee, the defendant, who is the plaintiff in error, set up as a defence that there was a balance of , purchase-money due and unpaid, and that he was not obliged to make a deed until full and complete payment by the plaintiff below. To maintain this position, he claimed that as interest on the unpaid purchase-money was not paid annually, he was entitled to interest on the interest thus unpaid, or compound interest. By this process, his vendee would have still been in debt to him on the articles. But the court below overruled this view of the case; and for doing so this writ of error was sued out, and the case is here on this point alone.</p>
    <p id="Aam" data-blocks='[["BL_211.14",211,[165,1785,1171,517]]]'>Interest is a compensation for the detention or use of money; and it has its origin in the usages of trade; by contract, or by statute, and hence the laws and practice in regard to it are as diversified as the trade, habits of the people, or their peculiar laws may be. While it assimilates, in certain matters, in various communities, it differs widely in others. In Massachusetts, it has been held in several cases, where interest was sued for and recovered, being payable annually, that interest might be recovered as if the suit had been on an instalment; and so in some of the other states of this Union. But it will not advance our present purpose to enter into a disquisition in regard to diversities in different communities on this subject.</p>

In a note to Selleck <em>v. </em>French, 1 <em>Conn. R. </em>32, in 1 <em>Am. Lead. Cases </em>633, it is said “ an agreement to pay interest on interest is not usurious nor illegal;” 3 <em>New Hamp. Rep. 40; </em>“and the better opinion is that at law, such an agreement made either at or after the time of the original contract will be enforced:” citing cases of Pawling <em>v. </em>Pawling, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Yeates%20220" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="4 Yeates 220">4 <em>Yeates </em>220</a>; Camp <em>v. </em>Bates, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Conn.%20448" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="11 Conn. 448">11 <em>Conn.

Rep. </em>14</a>, Chancellor Kent says, “Interest upon interest, or compound interest, is never allowed, unless in special cases — as where there is a settlement of accounts between the parties, after interest has become due, or there has been an agreement for that purpose, <em>subsequent </em>to the original contract.” Whether an agreement to pay interest on interest in order to be good, must be made subsequently to the original obligation or not, or what constitutes its precise consideration, we are not called on to determine. The cases are cited to show that interest on interest is never an incident (unless where there has been a settlement, judgment, or the like, which produces a new principal, aggregating the principal and interest which had fallen due), but only where there exists a special agreement to do so in such form as to be valid.</p>

This is just the process of compounding interest and within the definition.</p>

Debt would accumulate with a rapidity beyond all ordinary calculations and endurance. Common business cannot sustain such overwhelming accumulations. It would tend also to inflame the avarice and harden the heart of the creditor. Some allowance must he made for the indolence of mankind, and the casualties and delays incident to the best regulated industry; and the law is reasonable and humane, which gives to the debtors’ infirmity of want of precise punctuality, some relief 'in the same infirmity of the creditor. If the one does not pay this interest to the uttermost farthing at the very moment it falls due, the other will equally fail to demand it with punctuality. He can, however, demand it, and turn it into principal when he pleases, and we may safely leave this benefit to rest upon his own vigilance or his own indulgence.”</p>
