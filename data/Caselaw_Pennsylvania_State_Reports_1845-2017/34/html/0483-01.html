    <p id="ATh" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[321,841,1156,1282]]]'>In the case, therefore, of a child had after the making of his will, such child must be provided for in such will, or the decedent dies intestate as to such child. In Kenebel <em>v. </em>Scrafton, <em>2 East </em>530, both the wife and children were substantially and properly provided for in the will, though under a different character and denomination: “There is not, therefore, in this case,” says Lord Ellenborough, “ that total change in the situation of the family, and that total destitution of provision for those who ought to be the objects of the testator’s care and protection (although the pi’ovision be made for them under a different character), which can vacate the will, on the ground of a supposed tacit condition that it should be void, upon a total change in the situation, and a total want of provision for the family so newly circumstanced.” In England, therefore, the will was revoked, unless provision was made for both wife and children. By our Act of Assembly, marriage alone revokes the will, as to the widow, <em>pro </em>tanto, and so also does the birth of a child, if not provided for in such will, which words are clearly used in the same sense as they are in the case of Kenebel <em>v. </em>Scrafton. Now, this is a positive statutory enactment, which can neither be repelled by parol testimony, outside of the will, nor by any language used in the will, raising a presumption that he did not intend to provide for such after-born child. In relation to the wife, our law differs substantially from the English law, in giving her, independent of any disposition by the will of her husband, not only her dower, but also one-third or one-half of his personal estate, according to circumstances. It is, therefore, proper to give this construction to the well-weighed words of our act, in relation to a provision for a child, whose interests may be sacrificed to a mere stranger, by giving a forced meaning to this plain and clear language.</p>

In the first Act of 4th February 1748-9, the words used are, “ have a child or children <em>not named </em>in any such will,” and there is no doubt that what C. J. Tilghmakt says, in Coates <em>v. </em>Hughes, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Binn.%20507" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Binn. 507">3 <em>Binn. </em>507</a>, related to this act, and not to that of 1764. “ Prior to this,” says the chief justice, “ in the year 1764, <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>the legislature of Pennsylvania being struck, in consequence of an event which took place in the city of Philadelphia, with the imperfection of the common law, as then understood, made a provision for all cases which could occur under a subsequent marriage.” The Act of 1764, which repealed the Act of 1748, however, changed its language, and, instead of requiring simply the naming of the child, made it necessary that he should be provided for, and these words have been' carefully preserved in the subsequent Acts of 1794 and 1833. In New York, a child so after born, must be “ unprovided for in any settlement, and neither provided for nor in any way mentioned in his will.”</p>

If so, it is a provision for after-born children, and as such falls within the words as well as the spirit of the act. Although a bequest often assumes the form of a recommendation, it is not less -obligatory on that account. A principle explained at some length in Pennock’s Case (Coates’s Appeal),” 2 <em>Barr </em>120.</p>

Rut Coates’s Appeal, which was the basis of this construction, has been solemnly overruled by this court in Pennock’s Estate, 8 <em>Harris </em>274, and upon the doctrine there laid down, there is no doubt that no such trust was created as was supposed by Judge Rogers. In McKnight <em>v. </em>Read, <a href="/whart/1/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Whart. 213" data-case-ids="1829031" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0213-01">1 <em>Whart. </em>213</a>, the court held, that a child, <em>in ventre sa mere, </em>was not to be considered as living within the meaning of a will, and that the will was revoked so far as respected the share or proportion of such child of the estate, because this construction was most for the Ínteres] of the posthumous child.</p>

      <a id="p488" href="#p488" data-label="488" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*488</a>By the present English statute of wills, 1 Vict. ch. 26, every will made by a man or woman shall he revoked by his or her marriage, except wills made in exercise of certain powers of appointment. Under this act it has been decided in Otway <em>v. </em>Sadlier, in the Court of Probate in Ireland, 33 <em>Law Times Rep. </em>46, that where a party makes a will, and during the same day marries, the marriage will operate as a revocation of the will; notwithstanding, from the terms of the instrument, it appears that the testator did not intend that it should take effect till after the marriage. The will was executed half an hour before the marriage, and provided for the wife in a very ample manner. “ I cannot introduce,” says Judge Keating, “ any qualification into the 18th section, which I do not find in the statute. In the present case, it is perfectly plain and clear, that the testator did not intend that his marriage should revoke his will; at the same time, it is just possible that, if I was to entertain the question of intention, I might do violence, for aught I know, to the intention of the testator, for it by no means follows that, because on the wedding morning, the deceased was under the full belief that marriage did not interfere with that will, he was not better advised afterwards, and was then of opinion that, from the fact of the subsequent marriage, the will could not prevail. It appears to me that the law is perfectly plain in the case, and that the solemnization of the marriage operated as a revocation of the wdll.”</p>
