      <em>“ </em>In this action of ejectment, the plaintiffs seek to recover some 800 acres of land in this county. From the evidence and the admissions of the parties, it is certain, that Judge John Irwin was the owner of the land, prior to the alleged rights of the present, parties. Judge Irwin made his will on the 10th September 1818, which was proved on the 1st May 1822. By this will, he <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>devised the land in dispute to James Irwin, Esquire, his brother, in fee simple. On the 24th November 1820, he made a codicil to his will, in which he made no alteration in the devise. This will conferred a good and perfect title in law upon James Irwin, which is now vested in the present defendants, and of course, gives them the right, unless the plaintiffs have shown a better right from Judge Irwin.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[304,688,1157,1095]]]'>“ They claim to have done so. They do not pretend that they had a deed or formal contract in writing; but they allege — 1st. That Samuel Irwin, their father, being a resident in Ireland, was written to by Judge Irwin, to come to this country, and he would give him this ‘Jew’s tract.’ That Samuel did come, in pursuance of that, and took possession; and that, therefore, there was a note or memorandum in writing, signed by the party, Judge Irwin, which, upon being complied w’ith, gave a title according to the statute of frauds. The only evidence we have of such letters, is the loose declarations of Judge and James Irwin that they had written such letters; and that letters were received by Samuel Irwin, in Ireland. What the contents of these letters were, we have no evidence. That testimony was withdrawn by the plaintiffs, and the point was left to rest upon loose declarations of the parties. We do not think that this is sufficient to make out a contract in writing. The letters themselves, if forthcoming, were the best evidence; and if lost, or destroyed, their contents would be the next best proof. This having been withdrawn, left the case merely on the loose declarations proved now, after a lapse of near forty years. Such evidence would not be sufficient to establish a written contract, and would be within all the mischief of the statute of frauds; too vague and uncertain to establish a title to land, or any equity in opposition to the legal title. We therefore decide and instruct you, that the plaintiffs have failed to make out a title in writing, so as not to be affected by the statute of frauds.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b526-7" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[304,1794,1158,598]],["BL_527.1",527,[172,389,1157,900]]]'>“ The next position relied upon by the plaintiffs, is, that Judge Irwin made a parol gift to Samuel of this land, and that in pursuance of that gift, Samuel went into the possession, and made such valuable and permanent improvements, as take the case out of the statute. A parol contract, to be available to give title, must be proved clearly; actual, exclusive, and notorious possession must be taken, after and in pursuance of the contract; and such improvements made, of a permanent character, as cannot be compensated in damages. The contract must be on a valuable consideration. This need not be in money, nor advantages to the vendor, but may be in disadvantage or prejudice of the right or interest of the vendee: as if the vendee was induced to part with his property, leave his home and move upon, occupy, and expend his money and labour upon the property. What, then, constitutes a contract so as <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>to take the case out of the statute ? The construction of the law on this subject has undergone a material change within the last ten years. We are told that the evidence, in any case, ought to be clear, satisfactory, and certain. There ought to be no doubt in the description of the property. The subject of the contract; the terms of the contract; the 'consideration and the conditions, if any, should be established with equal certainty; for where a party asks to disregard the clear terms of a statute, by endeavouring to make out an exception to it, it ought not to be upon doubtful and equivocal testimony, nor upon vague and uncertain inferences. The intention of the one to give and grant, and the expectation of the other to take and enjoy, upon some kind of terms, which neither distinctly understood, and upon which they do not unite, will not be sufficient. If there was a parol contract, there must have been a time, a place, when and where the parties met and made it; its terms must have been talked over and comprehended, and agreed upon by both parties; and ordinary experience teaches, that unless reduced to writing, some witness must be called to the bargain, and particularly when the subject was so important as a tract of land; and the statute required that such a bargain should be put into writing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b527-6" data-blocks='[["BL_527.4",527,[175,1288,1154,515]]]'>“ In the case of an alleged gift from a father to a son, the law is now settled by repeated decisions,1 that the contract must be proved by direct and positive, express and unambiguous evidence. That is, it must be proved by some one who was present at the time it was made, and saw and heard the parties bargaining and agreeing, and uniting upon the terms of the contract. It must not be loose declarations of the parties, as to what had been agreed upon before, or what they intended to do hereafter; but a present agreement, definite in its terms, certain in its meaning, understood by both parties alike, and concluded upon as their bargain. This rule has also been extended to the case of a gift by a grandfather to his grandson : McCue <em>v. </em>Johnston, 1 <em>Casey </em>306.</p>

A claim by parol, being a mere equity and imperfect title, may be abandoned; and if the jury believe, Samuel did accept a lease for life, it would be an abandonment of any former claim under a parol contract, and his title thenceforth would be that contained in the writing; and <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>he would be estopped from alleging a precedent and inconsistent verbal contract: Rankin <em>v. </em>Simpson, 7 <em>Harris </em>471.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b528-7" data-blocks='[["BL_528.5",528,[311,765,1152,383]]]'>“ The next point relied upon is, that when Judge Irwin made his will, his design was to secure this land to Samuel Irwin, by devising it to James Irwin, in trust, that he would convey it to Samuel, when he would come on from Ireland. A mere design and intention of Judge Irwin that it should be so, if even clearly proved by parol, would not be sufficient to create a trust in James; it would be altering a will by parol, which the law will not permit; as all wills of land must be in writing, and cannot be altered or contradicted by parol.</p>

A state of facts that raises such a trust, must be by an agreement made before the date of the will, and may be proved by parol; and if so proved by clear, satisfactory, certain, and unambiguous evidence, a chancellor would compel a conveyance, and a court and jury will hold James and his devisees as trustees, and they would be compelled to give up the possession.</p>

He did not insist on a formal contract, much less on a written, but he said, if “ James Irwin, the devisee, was made acquainted with the wishes and designs of Judge Irwin, in regard to Samuel, and the judge communicated to, him his will, that Samuel should have the land as soon as he came from Ireland, and in consequence of this direction, and confidence and trust reposed in him, James Irwin agreed to accept the devise, and carry out the trust and confidence of the judge, then he would be a trustee for the use of Samuel, and if thus a trustee, the case is not within the Statute of Frauds, and James would be bound to convey.” This was leaving the jury to infer the trust from all the circumstances in proof; and it is the misfortune of the plaintiffs that they could not persuade the jury to make the inference.</p>
