Weir, as attorney for different persons, had claims against the sheriff, arising out of the sale of Jamison’s property, for about $4000, and for about $300, out of other official transactions; he also, as attorney for William Reed, the appellant, had a claim of $2300 against Montgomery in his private capacity.

Therefore, and in consideration of my aforesaid indebtedness, and in payment thereof, I do hereby assign, transfer, and set over three thousand one hundred and five dollars of the aforesaid notes, to those said creditors to whom I am officially liable, as their said attorney may designate, to be distributed as he may see proper. And, if I fail to pay the balance of my official liabilities or indebtedness in his charge for collection, before the 1st September 1858, the time the last of said notes fall due, then, and in that event, I hereby assign and transfer whatever amount of said notes may be required to pay the same in full. I further assign and transfer three hundred dollars thereof to William M. Stewart, in payment of claims in his hands for collection, for which I am officially liable. The balance of said notes, I assign and transfer to William Reed, in payment of my indebtedness to him, hereby excepting and reserving three hundred and forty-five dollars to myself, out of the first money paid on said notes, to be applied to the payment of a claim now pressing collection against me.” .</p>

If he is entitled at all, it is not on the ground that he is a distributee, but that the fund in court is his, and not liable to be distributed. The success of this claim will, of course, depend upon his title under the equitable assignment. Not having been a party to the bill in equity, he is not estopped by that, nor perhaps is he to be affected by the action of the court in appointing an auditor to make distribution. Treating it so, for the purposes of this investigation, what title has he to the money ?</p>

    <p id="b209-8" data-blocks='[["BL_209.6",209,[153,1432,1178,431]]]'>Reed’s attorney, the active agent in procuring the assignment of these bonds to secure other debts besides his, had notice of the consideration of them, and this was notice to him. He acted not only in the capacity of attorney in procuring the assignment, but as his agent, for it would appear that Reed was not present at the time of the assignment at all. Surely this notice to the attorney who managed the business was notice to the principal. And the import of the notice was, that the sheriff was transferring what' was not his own property, but what the law constituted him a trustee to dispose of according to law.</p>
    <p id="b209-9" data-blocks='[["BL_209.7",209,[149,1862,1172,431]]]'>This being so, can it admit of a doubt but that equity would interpose to prevent the funds from being wrongfully converted or appropriated to the use'of a party who was a participator in the bad faith of the trustee ? In this case, there was nothing resembling an equity in the appellant. Not only was there notice of the character of the transaction by the sheriff, but there was no present value given for the assignment; but it was to be applied in extinguishment of an antecedent private debt due by the assignor. The assignee was not a <em>bond'fide </em>holder for a valuable consideration: 5 <em>Casey </em>160.</p>

Both the creditors and sureties, in a case like the present, have such rights as entitle them to interpose. It is no answer to the former, to say that they can look to the sureties of the sheriff in case of default by him. They can and may do so; but if they can, by a shorter process, possess themselves of what belongs to them, it is right they should do so, in relief of what is, at most, a gratuitous obligation on part of his bail, and in many instances a burdensome and losing one.</p>
