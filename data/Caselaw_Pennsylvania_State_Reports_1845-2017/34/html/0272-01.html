Baskin, the guardian of the minor children of Thomas Stevenson. As the trust funds in his hands are, by the terms of the deed, charged with the remaining debts incurred by Thomas Stevenson, under the power granted to him by that instrument, Mr. Baskin is a trustee, and liable to account as such to the creditors of the trust. But it is in his capacity as trustee, that he is to account; and, therefore, the proper place to file and settle his account is in the Court of Common Pleas, and not in the Orphans’ Court. In such account, he would be obliged to charge himself with the whole trust estate derived from the trust deed, which would be appropriated first to pay the creditors; and secondly, to hand over the remaining balance to himself, in his capacity of guardian of the minor children of Thomas Stevenson; and his account as guardian in the Orphans’ Court, as settled in the register’s office, would then include this balance, and any other property of the infants coming from any other source. Having pointed out the proper mode of proceeding, it is evident that the course adopted, of settling the whole in the Orphans’ Court, in his account as guardian simply, was erroneous, and cannot be sustained.</p>
