The report was only signed by two of the viewers, N. Patterson and M. Harbison. The proceedings were under the Act of 24th February 1845: <em>Brightly's Purd. </em>728-9, pi. 118-21.</p>

A copy of a previous one is put on our paper-books; but we have nothing to do with it. It does not properly appeal’, therefore, that any of these viewers were on a former view of the same matter; and if it did, we might not regard them as incompetent, if this view be substantially but a recommitment of the case, because of some formal error in the first proceeding.

    <p id="b415-6" data-blocks='[["BL_415.4",415,[205,462,1166,607]]]'>The real objection of these compláinants is, that the damages allowed them are insufficient, and the court refers them to another view for that, and confirmed the view. But we do not think that they were then .entitled to a view, or review, on account of the damages. In the ease of Durnall’s Road, 8 <em>Casey </em>383, under a similar law, we decided that a review was the proper remedy for such a complaint. An exception does not reach the case, for, to sustain it, would set aside the road, which would be giving it too much effect; or would set aside the part of it which is in favour of the exceptants, and that is not what they want. They want more damages, and ought, therefore, to have asked for a review at the second term. The remark of the court that they were willing to grant another view for the damages, goes for nothing, and is improperly on the record.</p>
