That on the 11th day of December, A. D. 1857, the plaintiff filed in said action a copy of his book entries, and of two promissory notes, as the cause of action upon which the said suit was brought. That on the sixteenth day of January, A. D. 1858, the plaintiff withdrew, in open court, the copy of book entries aforesaid, filed in the said suit, to Dee. T., 1857, No. 726, and on that day, upon a rule previously granted to him for that purpose, took a judgment in the said suit, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence, upon the two promissory notes aforesaid. That this deponent is advised, that the said withdrawal of the book entries aforesaid, by the said plaintiff, was an abandonment of his claim upon them, and in law a <em>retraxit, </em>which prevented him from suing these defendants for that claim again. That the copy of book entries filed in this case is for precisely the same items as that filed in the case aforesaid to Dec. T., 1857, No. 726, and is exactly the same claim which was withdrawn and abandoned as aforesaid.”</p>

The withdrawal conceded the truth of the statement, that the goods were obtained on a six months’ credit, but nothing more.</p>

But if claims may be counted on separately, they are separate causes of action, and a suit for one is no bar to a suit for another. And as a plaintiff is not bound to count for several claims in one action, unless on an order to consolidate, so, when he does so count, he may, with leave of court, withdraw one of them, and then it stands as a claim not sued upon, and may be the subject of a future action. Of course, and <em>a fortiori, </em>when a claim is withdrawn because of an objection by the defendant that it is not yet due, it may be the subject of another action, and the withdrawal cannot be treated as a <em>retraxit.</em>
