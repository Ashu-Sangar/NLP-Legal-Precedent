    <p class="summary" id="b76-6" data-blocks='[["BL_76.4",76,[282,480,1169,848]]]'>“ The plaintiff claims the land through the Mary Poster warrant, dated 2d October 1792, for 52 acres, on which a survey was made for 95 acres and 60 perches, and accepted in the land office 2d April 1821. Mary Poster died in Ohio, after having made her last will, dated 16th November 1828, and admitted to probate 27th July 1829. She devised this land to her son Thomas Poster. Thomas died unmarried, some ten or twelve years ago, leaving, as his heirs at law, six brothers and sisters, or their children. Pour of the six brothers and sisters are still alive, and sold their share in this land to David Poster, viz. Benjamin, Basil, Mary intermarried with Enoch Zenk (also deceased), and Elizabeth intermarried with Samuel Horton. John and Sarah are deceased — the latter, in her lifetime, was intermarried with Lewis Oheney. John left seven children, five of whom conveyed to David Poster; and Sarah left six children, of whom four conveyed to David Poster, who conveyed to plaintiff. It is said by the counsel, that the interests so conveyed make one hundred and thirteen one hundred and twenty-sixths of the land in dispute. It is upon this title, and to the extent just mentioned, that the plaintiff claims your verdict.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b76-7" data-blocks='[["BL_76.5",76,[282,1339,1166,673]]]'>“ The defendants resist a recovery on several grounds. Ephraim Poster testifies that he bought the undivided half of this warrant from Thomas in the year 1818, by parol, and that Benjamin Poster bought the other undivided half from Thomas, in the same way, and about the same time. He says, that in 1822 he sold the interest he had purchased, to Benjamin, and that by an arrangement between them, he made a deed to Loy and Patterson, to whom Benjamin had sold, for 25 acres, lying at the south end of the tract, by a line which was agreed upon, and marked on the ground. He says this was done some tvrenty years ago, and that Loy and Patterson refused to take any greater portion of the land. Benjamin sold the remaining half to William Anderson, by articles of agreement, dated 16th October 1819, recorded 10th March 1855. Anderson sold and conveyed 52 acres and 13 perches to Daniel Washabaugh, one of the defendants, 1st March 1854.</p>

How Thomas obtained the possession of the warrant does not appear, but he had it in his possession in 1818, when he sold to Ephraim and Benjamin. In 1821, the warrant was executed, and the return made. Either the Fosters or Anderson had the survey made — most likely the latter. Besides the 25 acres sold to Loy and Patterson, at the south end, a part of the north end was also sold off, leaving the 52 acres and <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>18 perches in the centre in dispute.

    <p class="summary" id="b77-6" data-blocks='[["BL_77.4",77,[193,466,1172,605]]]'>“ The defendants say there can be no recovery, because, First: The warrant in 1818 was a chattel, when Thomas sold by parol to Benjamin and Ephraim; and that Thomas being in possession of the paper, the law presumes that he was the legal owner of it, and for a valuable consideration. Second: That if Thomas had not the legal right to dispose of the warrant in 1818, having sold a defective title to Benjamin and Ephraim, and having acquired a good title from his mother, in 1829, it became vested in the vendee of Benjamin and Ephraim; or, in other words, the heirs of Thomas,' and those who hold under them, are estopped from claiming under it in this case. Third: That the defendants, and those under whom they claim, have title by the statute of limitations, having had the adverse' possession of the land for upwards of twenty-one years.</p>

The mere possession of the warrant by Thomas, gave him no title to the land— and there is no such presumption of law as is alleged. He may have been his mother’s agent, and held it for her use. At all events, defendants have failed to show that he had the right to it by purchase.</p>
