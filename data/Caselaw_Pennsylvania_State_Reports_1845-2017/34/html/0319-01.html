This question has been several times before the Supreme Court, and, if we can understand the decisions, they are conflicting and unsettled; and it is impossible to reconcile them. The case of Hastings’ Administrator <em>v. </em>Eckley’s Administrator, 8 <em>Barr </em>194, affirming the court below, would seem to be pretty positively overruled in the case of McDowell <em>v. </em>Oyer, 9 <em>Harris </em>417. The latter quite distinctly establishes the principle, that the value of the land should be taken into consideration, in making up the amount of damages to be recovered. We believe this is the last decision, and we might content ourselves by determining the question, in the negative of all the points, on authority alone. If, however, it was a new question, on principle, I cannot perceive any well founded objection to it. On an executed contract — a deed with covenant of warranty — where the vendee is evicted, it is true, it has long been settled in Pennsylvania, that the vendee is limited in his recovery, no matter how valuable the improvement he may have made, to the amount of purchase-money and interest from the time of payment. I can remember when even that was a much debated and discussed question with the profession; but it has now been long settled. The reason, the best that probably could be given for it, is this : that the deed was to run through all time — both parties had the opportunity of examining the title — the vendee or his descendants might make expensive improvements — matters of taste and fancy, rendering it very difficult often to determine their real value. With a contract executory, the presumption would naturally be, that the time for its completion and final execution would be but brief, and the vendee not likely to expend large amounts in fanciful improvements, before he obtained a deed. Hence, in an executory contract, where the vendee has performed his part of the agreement, we understand the rule to be established quite as well the other way — that the vendee, on failure or refusal of the vendor to make a deed according to his contract, may recover the value of the land; and, indeed, may give in evidence his improvements, and may recover a sum as a conditional verdict, at least sufficient to make it the interest of the vendor to make a deed according to his contract. But, independent of that consideration, and when the title has failed, and the vendor cannot make title, the vendee is entitled to recover damages commensurate with the value of the land at the time the deed was to have been made. The rule of damages on the breach of a contract of sale of personal property is well settled, to be the difference between the contract price and <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>that of the article at the time and place of delivery. I can see no reason why the same principle should not govern in a contract for the sale of real estate. Why, in the one case, the vendor should profit by his wrong, and- suffer for it in the other. The defendant’s points are determined in the negative. The jury will, therefore, take into consideration the value of the land — ascertain from the evidence, the difference, if any, between the contract price and the actual value of the land and property at the <em>time; </em>and, if satisfied there is sufficient evidence of a distinct and definite contract for a fixed price, and the defendant, in violation of that contract, sold to another for a higher price, give such damages as they may think just and equitable, under all the circumstances of the case.”</p>

This court appears to have made a distinction, as to the rule of damages, between the two classes.

The consideration of the contract was an ascertained and fixed sum of money, no part of which seems to have been paid, but the plaintiff was put to certain expenses and trouble in the preparation of title-deeds, when it was discovered the defendant could not perform the contract. He dees not controvert the plaintiff’s right to recover a measure of damages that will indemnify him for the trouble and expenses incurred, but the plaintiff claims damages for the value of the bargain — that is, for the value of the property beyond the consideration agreed to be paid.</p>

The value of the land, is sometimes spoken of as the measure of damages, but that means the value, as measured by the consideration, rather than the difference between the consideration and what the land will fetch in market. • The parties fix their own estimate of the value, when they fix the consideration. If there be eviction, or failure to convey, after that consideration has been paid, it shall be returned with interest — if it have not been paid, the expenses incurred are to be reimbursed. The vendor is to restore the vendee to the condition in which he found him, but he is not bound to compensate him for the value of the bargain.</p>

Hence, the recovery for breach of the covenant of warranty was in other lands. The disappointed alienee would be sure to insist on the most rigorous standard of compensation, but, says Ch. Kent, 4 <em>Com. </em>475, the value was computed as it existed when the warranty was made, so that though the land had afterwards become of increased value by the discovery of a mine, or by buildings, or otherwise, yet the warrantor was not to render in value according to the then state of things, but as the land was when he made the warranty. And when personal covenants were introduced, adds the Chancellor, as a substitute for the remedy on the voucher and warranty, the established measure of compensation was not varied or affected.</p>
