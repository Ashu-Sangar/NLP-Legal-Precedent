The object of the company was to manufacture rosin oil from a certain patent called Robbins’ patent, bearing date the fourth day of November 1851. The chief operations of the company were to be carried on at Chester, in the county of Delaware, and the state of Pennsylvania.

It was all subscribed by four persons, in connection with those interested in the patent. There was no evidence that any part of the capital stock was paid in cash. The company purchased eleven and a half or twelve acres of land, at $300 per acre, upon which they erected buildings and improvements, which cost, with the land, $69,000. The lands and improvements were encumbered by judgments and mortgages to the amount of $44,291, to which is to be added an assessment of twenty-five per cent, on the stock, amounting to $30,000 or $35,000, called a preferred loan, which together amounted to a sum exceeding the cost of the land and the improvements. The company commenced operations in November or December 1853, and ceased them about the first day of October 1854, being unable to pay their debts. In March 1855, they leased the works to R. Wilson Desilver, for the term of five years. In lieu of rent, Mr. Desilver agreed to pay the <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>interest on the mortgage of $25,000, and the interest on $3491 (which was the balance due on another mortgage for $10,000), the taxes amounting to about $200 per .-annum — keep the premises insured to the amount of $10,000, for which he paid the annual premium of $150, and keep the premises in repair.

The large powers vested in their brother, the trustee, were therefore to be exercised for this object, taking care, at the same time, that the capital, in which their issue had a deep interest, should neither be impaired nor placed at hazard. The general rule is well settled, that where trust-money cannot be applied either immediately, or by a short day, to the purposes of the trust, it is the duty of the trustee to make the fund productive to the <em>cestuis que trust </em>by the investment of it on some proper, security. Our Act of Assembly has provided for just such a case, where the principal or capital is to remain for a time in his possession or under his control, and the interest, profits, or income thereof are to be paid away, by authorizing investments to be <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>made in certain public stocks, or on real securities, which, when made under an order of the Orphans’ Court, exempt the trustee from all liability of loss for the same.</p>

The language of the will itself excludes any such idea, and this brings us to the question whether the mere act of incorporating such a partnership can make such a purchase or investment prudent, discreet, and legal ?</p>

The object of the company was to manufacture rosin oil from a certain patent called Robbins’ patent, bearing date 4th November 1851.

It was all subscribed by four persons, in connection with those interested in the patent, fulfilling nominally the requirement of five or more persons. The capital being $200,000, one-fourth of it, or $50,000, should have been paid down before the company could become a corporation, and fifty per cent., or $100,000, must be paid before it could commence operations. These sums must be actually paid in cash, and yet the master reports, “ There was no evidence that any part of the capital was paid in cash.” The whole capital was therefore a fiction, having no foundation in reality, and the certificate was a fraud upon the Commonwealth. The company purchased eleven and a half or twelve acres of land, at three hundred dollars per acre, upon which they erected buildings and improvements, which cost with the land sixty-nine thousand dollars. The lands and improvements were encumbered by judgments and mortgages to the amount of forty-four thousand two hundred and ninety-one dollars, to which is to be added an assessment of twenty-five per cent, on the stock, amounting to thirty or thirty-five thousand dollars, called a preferred loan, which, together, amounted to a <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>sum exceeding the cost of the land and the improvements. The company commenced operations in November or December 1853, and ceased them about the first day of October 1854, being unable to pay their debts.

It wants all the characteristics of a judicious investment, for, 1st, There was no security for the capital present or prospective: 2d, It produced no income, nor did it offer the slightest prospect of ever affording any: 3d, The whole was an untried and unfinished experiment.</p>
