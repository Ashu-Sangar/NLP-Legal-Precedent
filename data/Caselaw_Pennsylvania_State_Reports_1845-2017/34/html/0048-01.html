After Martin had made the purchase, a replevin was taken out by Mullison, and the horse delivered by the sheriff to Mullison; and the only question now for your consideration is, what ought to be the damages which you ought to award to the plaintiff? He has obtained his horse, and of course you cannot properly allow him damages on that account. Now what ought to he the measure of damages by which you should ascertain the damages which the plaintiff has sustained in this ease ? In somewhat analogous cases, it has been held, that when a sheriff or constable acts in good faith and honestly in levying and selling, by mistake, the property of a stranger, nothing more ought to be allowed than compensatory damages ; which means interest upon the property taken while in possession of the wrongdoer. But if the acts of the defendant were wanton or oppressive, or a malicious invasion of the rights of the plaintiff then you would be justified in allowing exemplary damages. If Hippie, or Nagle, had reasonable grounds to believe <a id="p49" href="#p49" data-label="49" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*49</a>that Mullison was the owner of the property which was levied upon, and if, after being satisfied of this fact, the defendant still persisted in holding the property, and selling the same, then this would be a fact, from which an oppressive intention on his part might be inferred. If the constable had no satisfactory evidence of who was the owner of the property, and he found it in the possession of the defendant in the execution, he would not be liable to exemplary damages, if he proceeded to levy upon and sell the property; unless in the mean time he had such evidence or facts brought to his notice, which ought to satisfy a reasonable man that Mullison was the owner of the horse. If he was satisfied before he sold the horse, that the horse belonged to Mullison, this would be an oppressive act, which would justify you in allowing exemplary damages. It will be your province to determine from the testimony, whether the horse was wantonly or maliciously levied upon and sold, or whether he acted in good faith, in the honest and fair discharge of his duty. If so, he ought only to be allowed compensatory damages.”</p>

Against Lewis Martin a suit in replevin (August Term 1856, No. 190), was brought, on the day he obtained possession (the 17th of July), and the horse was delivered to Mullison and remained in his possession. In the replevin suit, judgment by default was obtained against Martin, and that judgment remains at present in full force and virtue. That they are ignorant, in point of law, on which side they ought, upon these facts, to find the issue.

J.:— “ According to the facts set forth in the special verdict rendered in this case, it appears, that the plaintiff, being the owner of a horse, hired the same to Doctor Smith Armor; that while in his possession, it was levied upon, and taken possession of by defendant, as constable, by virtue of an execution issued upon a judg<a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>ment obtained by Samuel Hippie, before Squire Auxer. The horse was afterwards sold by the constable, and Levi Martin became the purchaser. The plaintiff then issued a writ of replevin out of this court to August Term 1856, No. 190, against the purchaser. Upon this writ, the property was delivered over to the plaintiff, and on the 8d of September 1856, judgment entered against the defendant by default. The question now arises, is the action of replevin and judgment thereon a bar to the plaintiff’s recovery in this suit ? If that action afforded a remedy to the plaintiff (whether he availed himself of it or not) by which he might have obtained satisfaction for the injury complained of in this suit, then I am of the opinion this action cannot be maintained. But it appears to me, that the subject-matters in dispute in the two actions were not only different, but under no circumstances could the plaintiff have recovered in the replevin case, satisfaction for the cause of action complained of here. The replevin was rather a proceeding <em>in rem. </em>It is true, damages may be recovered, but they could only be for a detention of the horse by him, which was for a very short time, and not for the taking, which is the gist of the action. If the horse had been voluntarily surrendered by defendant to the plaintiff, that would not have defeated this action; it would only have gone in mitigation of damages. That the same object accomplished by operation of law, should produce a different result, appears to me inexplicable. Suppose the defendant had taken two or three horses instead of one, and made sale of all to different persons, the plaintiff would have had a right to issue a replevin against each purchaser, and a judgment in one action would scarcely be pretended to be a bar to a recovery in the other suits. It is true, if the plaintiff had brought a suit for trespass or trover against the defendant it would have stood as a bar against any action against his vendee, because the action was capable of embracing the matter which constituted the cause of action against the defendant’s vendees. But under no circumstances was this the case with the action of replevin, upon which the defendant relies as a bar; all that could be recovered, was the property, or the value thereof, and damages for the detention, which would not reach the cause of action complained of here. The numerous authorities referred to by the counsel for the defendant, on the argument, in our opinion, do not, in principle, reach the case, nor in our opinion have the exceptions to the damages been sustained. Judgment is therefore directed to be entered for the plaintiff on the special verdict for $50.”</p>

The court instructed the jury, that it was their province to determine, from the testimony, whether the trespass, in seizing and selling the horse, was wanton and malicious, or whether the officer acted in good faith, in a fair discharge of his duty, in the execution of his writ: that, in the one aspect of the case, compensatory damages would be the measure of recovery, but, in the latter aspect of it, the jury might give exemplary damages.

I do not understand the counsel to argue, that compensation alone is the measure of damages in trespass for an injury to, or amotion of, private property; and yet the argument tends to this result. While it may be conceded, that there seems to be a want of legal logic in the idea of compensation beyond the injury, by way of punishment for the evil motives of the trespasser, yet the law is well settled that it may be given. There are many things constituting property to an owner, the value of which to any one else would be inappreciable — a picture, a portrait, or the like, the destruction of or injury to which might amount only to a trespass, although wantonly or recklessly done. Shall a trespasser only make compensation, in such a case, for the money value of such property, or to the extent of depreciation ? It never has been so held. In every case of oppression, outrage, and vindictiveness on part of the trespasser, the damages may be estimated and given in a punitive shape, rather than merely as compensatory. The cases of Rose <em>v. </em>Story, 1 <em>Barr </em>190, Good <em>v. </em>Mylin, 8 <em>Barr </em>51, Amer <em>v. </em>Longstreth, 10 <em>Barr </em>145, relied on by the plaintiff in error as sustaining his position, do not do so. They were merely corrective of instructions referring the question of exemplary damages to a jury, in the absence of proof of aggravation. In such cases, the rule undoubtedly is, that compensation is the extent of recovery: Forsyth <em>v. </em>Palmer, 2 <em>Harris </em>96. In the case of Rose <em>v. </em>Story, Mr. Justice Rogers says, beyond compensation, “ upon no principle of law or equity, is the jury permitted to go, unless in cases of gross oppression or aggravation, when the jury may mulct the party in vindictive damages.” In Amer <em>v. </em>Longstreth, Bell, J., said, the court below were correct in the “ statement of the abstract rule,” that, “ in actions of trespass, the jury are not confined to the actual damage sustained ; they may go beyond that, if the case shows a wanton invasion of the plaintiff’s rights, or any circumstances of aggravation or outrage. This is for the jury to determine, and, within reasonable bounds, it is a matter peculiarly within their control.” There are many authorities to the same effect, but not necessary to be cited <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>in support of such a familiar principle. It is the duty of the court to submit the question of the kind of damages that may be given, to the jury, if there be evidence of aggravation or oppresssion; compensation is the rule, in the absence of such circumstances. Exemplary damages may follow in the wake of their existence; but there must be evidence on the point. If there is, it is proper to submit it to the jury for the ascertainment of the circumstances that constitute oppression and aggravation. The facts may or not satisfy a jury that exemplary damages should be given — but they alone can dispose of the eyidence, if there be any on the subject. Here, we have not the testimony legally before us, and we must presume that there was evidence on the point of oppression or aggravation, or it would not have been submitted to them by the learned judge. But, looking at it in its informal shape on the paper-books, we would say that there was abundant evidence, if believed by the jury, to authorize them in finding exemplary damages.</p>

The action of replevin against the purchaser, and the recovery of the horse, were no bar to an action against the constable for the original taking. The purchaser at the sale Was answerable for no damages before that, and only for such as accrued by reason of his detainer afterwards. But the plaintiff had been deprived of the use and possession of the horse, by reason of the seizure and detention, some time before the sale. This was an injux-y to the ownex-, not to be covered by his success in the x’eplevin suit, for it was not the act of the purchaser. It was the act of the constable, the defendant. If his act was wrongful, he is answerable. Otherwise, the use of the animal, or detei’ioration to it, occurring after seizure and before sale, would go uncompensated. It is not like the case of a joint trespass, and a recovery and satisfaction by one.
