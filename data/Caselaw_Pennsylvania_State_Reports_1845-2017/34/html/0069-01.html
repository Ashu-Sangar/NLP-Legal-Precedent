The defence was, that these 430 blooms were shipped for Moore by mistake; on the day they arrived at Hollidaysburg, one of the firm of Hileman &amp; Hammond informed the defendant that Stewart &amp; Horrell had made a mistake in forwarding them for Robert Moore, that they should have been shipped on their account, and induced him to alter the manifest accordingly.</p>

J.) delivered the following charge to the jury : — “ In the months of September, October and November 1841, this defendant, as a common cai-rier on the Pennsylvania Canal, received on board his boat, 1586 blooms for Robert <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>Moore, which he agreed to deliver to Moore’s consignee at Pittsburgh ; of these all were delivered according to contract, except the 430 pieces shipped 29th October 1841. The metal was loaded in Water street, at the warehouse of Stewart &amp; Horrell, by the direction of the manufacturers, Hileman &amp; Hammond; and when the boat reached Patterson’s Wharf, in the town of Hollidaysburg, the defendant’s clerk, at the instance of Hammond, changed the manifest, so as to have the blooms forwarded to Pittsburgh for the firm of Hileman &amp; Hammond. As the defendant contracted to deliver the metal at Pittsburgh for Robert Moore, and to his consignee, by permitting the manifest to be altered and the destination changed, he became fixed for their value. Robert Moore commenced this suit 18th October 1842, and died in November following; since that time, the case has been prosecuted by his executors, and they will be entitled to your verdict for the value of the blooms and interest thereon, unless, as is alleged, the plaintiffs’ testator, or his agent for him, discharged defendant from the liability.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b71-6" data-blocks='[["BL_71.4",71,[206,1210,1167,904]]]'>“ It is said that Joseph P. Moore was the accredited agent for his father, to make settlement for him and generally to transact his business; and that in pursuance of this authority, on the 7th March 1842, and after the defendant was fixed for the value of the blooms, he came to Hollidaysburg on the hunt for these blooms, and at the office of defendant he learned why it was that they had never reached his father’s consignee at Pittsburgh. It is said, that Hammond, of the firm of Hileman &amp; Hammond, happened to be in town, and was called in, and he gave as the reason for changing the manifest, that the metal had been shipped by mistake, that the blooms that belonged to Robert Moore lay further down the wharf and were there still; and It is alleged that an arrangement was there and then made, by which the agent agreed to take the blooms at the wharf at Water street, in lieu of those missent, and it is also said, that Robert Moore afterwards did receive the metal under this arrangement. If it is established here by the evidence, that Joseph P. Moore was the agent for his father for the settlement of this claim, and that in pursuance of that authority he made the arrangement testified to by Nelson, and that the father afterward received the metal as agreed upon, then the liability of defendant was thereby discharged.</p>

We affirm the first and second points; the law is correctly stated. We also answer the third point in the affirmative, except the latter clause, in which we are requested to say to you, that there is no evidence to show that the blooms were ever <em>set aside for or delivered to </em>Robert Moore. This is a question of fact which we submit to you, under the in<a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>strucfcions we have given ; the case is narrowed down to this question, and if the jury believe that Robert Moore received the metal at Water street wharf, or any other metal in lieu of the 430 pieces, lost to him by the act of the defendant and his agent, then he has no right to complain, and it can make but little difference in this case, whether he received them under the arrangement said to have been made with the son, or in any other way. If it was received, the defendant was released from all claim. But if the metal was received by the father, it is most likely that it was in pursuance of the arrangement, and this would be a ratification of the act by the father. If the statement made by Nelson is disbelieved by the jury, for the reason assigned in the argument, then the jury may perhaps come to the conclusion that there was no delivery of the metal. We submit the question of fact to the jury on all the evidence in the case.”</p>

As these pieces of blooms were never, according to contract, delivered to Robert Moore, or his consignees, by the defendant, he of course became liable for their amount to their owner, and this liability commenced on the 30th October 1841.</p>

That, in the course of a conversation between a clerk of the defendant, Hammond, and Joseph, the latter agreed to take <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>the blooms at Water street in lieu of those 430 pieces alleged by Hileman &amp; Hammond to have been missent. The jury found that Robert Moore never received the metal at Water street wharf, or any other metal in lieu of the 430 pieces lost to him by the act of the defendant; and this narrows the question down to — whether the agreement to take by the son, was a release of the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b73-6" data-blocks='[["BL_73.4",73,[173,642,1166,476]]]'>Joseph was a clerk in his father’s store on Water street, but the various acts alleged to have been done by him do not establish a general agency to transact all his father’s business, and clearly not to make a settlement of such an amount, by simply agreeing to take something which is never delivered or received. A letter of attorney, authorizing an agent “to collect a debt,” does not empower him to give a discharge upon receipt of the debtor’s note: <em>Story on Agency </em>63 a.; still less would a clerk be authorized to release a liability like the present, without receiving any consideration whatever; which would invalidate the contract under any aspect of the case.</p>
