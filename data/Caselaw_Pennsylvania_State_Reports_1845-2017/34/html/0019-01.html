The time is not annexed to the gift, but to. the payment of the legacy. Where the gift is not express, but to be inferred from a direction to pay at a particular time, the legacy is contingent. The testator gives and bequeaths to his three grandchildren (naming them) four hundred dollars each.

Where legacies are given, payable at a certain time, they carry no interest before that time; for interest is allowed for delay of payment, and consequently till the day of payment comes round, no interest is demandable. But the exception is equally well settled with the ■rule, that where the legatee is a child of testator, and a minor, incapable of supporting himself, or one to whom the testator has placed himself <em>in loco </em>parentis, and no special provision is made for the maintenance of the legatee, interest will be allowed on the legacy, although not payable until a future time, as upon the legatee’s attaining full age. Eor the purpose, in such case, of maintaining the legatee, interest must be paid on the legacy, whether it <em>be particular and </em>vested, <em>or particular and contingent, </em>or whether it be <em>residuary and vested </em>or <em>contingent.</em>

The grandchild, as shown by the answer, was five years of age at his death, of tender age, and unable to maintain himself. Did the grandfather intend he should be maintained out of his bounty; or left to the cold charity of others, and the interest upon the legacy permitted to accumulate so that, in the event of the grandson’s death, it would swell the residue, for the benefit of the children of Mrs. Sites, who are the residuary legatees, and receive the largest portion of his estate under the will ?</p>

He provides that a note of $300, held on his son-in-law, Jacob Bear, should be given up, ‘and this to be considered as his pay or satisfaction for bringing up and educating those three children of my daughter Martha.’ But it is said, here is provision made for the maintenance of the grandchildren, consequently their legacies will not bear interest. This provision was evidently intended as compensation to their father for maintenance, up to testator’s death; for it can scarce be supposed, he considered $100 would maintain a child of five years, so long as maintenance would be .necessary. If such could have been his intention, the sum provided being entirely inadequate, it is the duty of the court to supply a maintenance, by decreeing interest upon their legacies. But testator provides no fund for maintenance. He forgives his son-in-law a debt, but of his ability to apply this sum to the maintenance of his children, we have no evidence; and forgiving a debt to a-father unable to pay, would be a novel mode of providing a maintenance for testator’s grandchildren.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b22-6" data-blocks='[["BL_22.4",22,[339,570,1168,935]]]'>“ This presumption certainly ought to be equally strong when there are no children, and the grandchildren are the immediate objects of testator’s bounty. In the case cited, the legacy was contingent, but the court decreed the interest to a grandchild for maintenance. In that case, the court say: ‘ In Pennsylvania, the grandfather, as well as the father, is required by the Act of 18th June 1836, to relieve and maintain his grandchildren when their necessities require it; this statute is in accordance with the moral sense of mankind. Those who suppose that infant grandchildren do not, upon the death of their parents, take the place of the latter in the affections of their grandfather, are strangers to the most ordinary manifestations of the best feelings of the human heart. As the mementoes of the departed child, they have peculiar claims to his regard; and their unprotected helplessness, produced by the common bereavement, in most cases, rivets his affections to them, closer than they ever clung to their parents. If there is anything in the argument in favour of awarding interest on a legacy to a child, resting upon the presumption that a parent did not intend that his children should starve, the presumption holds with equal strength, where the parent is dead, and the grandchildren are, in the will, substituted to the legacy previously given to the parent for life.’</p>

The relinquishment of a debt against the father of the deceased, amounting tp $300, was rightly regarded as applicable to the past maintenance of the children. One hundred dollars would be a scanty provision for the future education and support of a child; and, as it was not a sum of money invested or bequeathed for that purpose, it has right to discard it from such a consideration, especially as the interest was not specifically devoted by the testator to any object inconsistent with the idea of a provision for the child.</p>
