    <p class="summary" id="b310-8" data-blocks='[["BL_310.6",310,[301,730,1170,1669]]]'>“ The question made here is one of every day practice, and if not settled (as we supposed it was), it is high time it should be put to rest. By the laws of Pennsylvania, all the real estate of a debtor, whether it be legal or equitable, is bound by a judgment against him. The legal title to real estate may be in one, and the equitable estate in another, and judgments against vendor and vendee will be a lien only on their distinct estates. Thus, a judgment enforced against the vendor, will only dispose of the legal estate, and leave the vendee at liberty to comply with the agreement made to purchase. And so, a judgment against the vendee, when levied, will only sell the equitable interest of the vendee, and that will be •measured by the amount of the purchase-money paid. Carrying out this principle, it is ruled, that a judgment given by the vendee, on the delivery of the deed, had a preference, as a lien, over prior judgments entered against the vendee before the acquisition of the legal title: Love <em>v. </em>Jones, <a href="/watts/4/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Watts 465" data-case-ids="1842704" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0465-01">4 <em>Watts </em>465</a>; Auwerter <em>v. </em>Mathiot, 9 <em>S. $ R. </em>402. The same principle is also ruled in McMullen <em>v. </em>Wenner, 16 <em>S. $• R. </em>18; Vierheller’s Appeal, 12 <em>Harris </em>107. It is ruled also in the last-mentioned case, that when the estate is sold on the vendor’s judgment for the purchase-money, the whole title passes to the purchaser; and whether he be the vendor or a stranger, the purchase-money is to be applied to the vendor’s judgment, without respect to its date. The vendor is not paid the proceeds of his judgment because it is a lien, but because he was the owner of the paramount title. In this ease also, the modification which the cases of Wilson <em>v. </em>Stoxe, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%20436" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Watts 436">10 <em>Watts </em>436</a>, and Day <em>v. </em>Lowrie, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%20417" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Watts 417">5 <em>Watts </em>417</a>, received in Horbach <em>v. </em>Riley, 7 <em>Barr </em>81, was fully confirmed. In this case, the property was not sold under a judgment for the purchase-money. Nor does it matter that the plaintiff had a judgment on record for the amount of the purchase-money, at the time of the levy and sale. It was merely a remedy which he might, but which he did not use, to enforce his claim against the property. And why should this mere remedy operate to transfer his paramount ownership, and that, too, when he declares upon the very face of it, that he does not mean to part with his title (which gives him a superior remedy) until the purchase-money is paid ? The title of the purchaser is fixed on the moment of the sale. It cannot be enlarged, by the vendor appearing before the auditor, and claiming to take the money on his judgment.”</p>
