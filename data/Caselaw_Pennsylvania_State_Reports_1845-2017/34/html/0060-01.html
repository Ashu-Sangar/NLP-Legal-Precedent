Of the purchase-money, $651.18 was paid in cash, and Kemp gave his two judgment bonds for the remainder, dated the 6th April 185.0; one for $400, payable 1st April 1851, and the other for $100, payable on the 1st April 1852, with interest.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b61-6" data-blocks='[["BL_61.4",61,[225,481,1171,478]]]'>To this point, the court below (Jones, P. J.) returned the following answer: — “In a case of .this kind, the evidence of a promise and the contract, must be clear, explicit, and certain; and if it is not so, the plaintiff cannot recover. The promise to pay the debt of another, for forbearance, should be clear, explicit, and certain, both as to the debt which is the subject of the alleged promise, and as to the promise' itself; it should be clearly made out to the satisfaction of the jury, that the parties agreed that there should be forbearance of a certain determined debt, and that they acted upon that agreement; the one party forbearing, in consideration of the other party promising to pay the debt forborne.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b61-7" data-blocks='[["BL_61.5",61,[229,958,1169,347]]]'>3. That if the evidence in this case proves a promise, or has a tendency to prove a promise of any kind, it is a promise to pay both debts of four hundred dollars each, secured by the two judgment-bonds and the two judgments entered on the same, in consideration of total forbearance; and plaintiffs having issued executions on one of the judgments, and sold all the real estate of Isaac E. Kemp, and purchased the same themselves, cannot recover upon such promise.</p>

There were several counts in the declaration as amended, laying this in different forms. For the balance of the purchase-money, her son, Isaac E. Kemp, had given two bonds, with warrants of attorney, upon which judgments were entered in Schuylkill county — the real debt in each being $400; the first payable on the 1st April 1852, and the second on the 1st April 1853.</p>
    <p id="b62-6" data-blocks='[["BL_62.4",62,[295,698,1166,132]]]'>Certain points were presented to the court on the trial, upon which they were asked by the defendant’s counsel to charge the jury, and the answers given are assigned for error.</p>
    <p id="b62-7" data-blocks='[["BL_62.5",62,[294,824,1166,464]]]'>The second and third errors assigned are, that although the court stated the law correctly, and as requested, they declined to say to the jury that, upon the evidence, the plaintiffs could not recover; and in leaving it to the jury to say, whether the evidence proved, or had a tendency to prove, the promise as stated by the defendant in his third point. In this we see no error, but only a careful demarcation of the line between the provinces of the judge and the jury. The law is properly laid down, and for that the court is responsible; and if the jury erred, the only remedy was a motion for a new trial in the court below, which was not resorted to in this case.</p>
    <p id="b62-8" data-blocks='[["BL_62.6",62,[294,1299,1166,601]]]'>The last point presented to the court, that the judgment-bonds and judgments entered thereon, being given by Isaac E. Kemp when he was a minor, are void, and insufficient to support the promise made by the testatrix, is founded upon a misconception of the law. The privilege of an infant is a personal privilege, of which he alone can take advantage, and contracts can be avoided for the infancy of the contractor, only by the contractor himself: <em>Macpherson on Infancy </em>478, (41 <em>Law </em>Library); Hesser <em>v. </em>Steiner, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0476-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 476" data-case-ids="478559" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0476-01">5 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>476</a>. Isaac E. Kemp was of age before the first bond became due, cut wood, and exercised acts of ownership on the land conueyed to him, and sold part of it to others, but never disputed the judgments or the securities upon which they were founded. The answer of the court may be considered as a negative one, and in this there was no error.</p>
