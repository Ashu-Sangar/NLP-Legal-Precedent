On the 6th April 1827, Mrs. Kelly made information against her husband, before a justice of the peace, for assault and battery. At the hearing, on the 8th April, a compromise was effected between them, and articles were signed, whereby they agreed to live separate, that Mrs. Kelly should keep the child, that each should have the property which belonged to them respectively, and neither of them should claim anything from the other. This agreement was lost, and could not be produced on the trial, but the justice by whom it was drawn, testified as to his recollection of its contents.</p>

John Kelly and Elizabeth Henry were married on the 1st January 1826, and had one child. It appeared that quarrels ensued between them, which resulted in his beating her, and finally kicking her out of the house. She never lived with him afterwards, but having “made information for assault and battery” against her husband, before Michael Reed, Esq., he testified, on the trial, that they appeared before him, “ and compromised — signed an agreement, and gave each a copy.”</p>

    <p id="A_D" data-blocks='[["BL_85.12",85,[148,1613,1169,374]]]'>The court saw that it was simply an agreement between man and wife, not under seal, nor acknowledged either by the husband, or by the wife separately, a form positively required by law where it is intended to dispose either of the wife’s own estate or her dower in that of her husband. The language was vague and uncertain, and there is not a word in it which can be fairly construed into a relinquishment of dower. The court therefore construed this instrument, and held that it did not bar the dower; and in this we see no error.</p>
