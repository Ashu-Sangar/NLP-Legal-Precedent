Wagonseller, cashier of the Bank of New Castle, absconded, taking with him about $27,000 in notes of the bank. A warrant was issued on oath of Joseph Kissick, a director, charging Wagonseller with <em>‘ </em>fraudulently embezzling about $27,000 of the notes of the Bank of New Castle, and appropriating the same to his own use.’ Of this sum, $26,500 were recovered — $5000 through D. Tidball, and $21,500 at the time of Wagonseller’s arrest. The loss on the sum stated in the complaint and warrant is therefore but $500.</p>

The first question is, whether damages can be assessed for other embezzlements, not charged in the complaint and warrant. If not, the exceptions as to the other embezzlements need not be examined. This exception must be sustained. It is unnecessary to inquire how far offences, not charged in the complaint, can be admitted into the indictment, by way of supplemental counts. For the purpose of this case it may be conceded, that the grand jury are not bound by the charge returned, but may find additional counts. But the question here does not rest on this admission, and depends solely on the true interpretation of the 25th and 26th sections of the Act of 30th July 1842.</p>

It is, therefore, only to the extent of the interest this act gives, that his right exists; and the terms of the act limit it to the offence charged, to answer which the recognisance is taken. Doubtless, a recognisance taken after indictment to answer the charges therein, would cover all the ground alleged in the bill; but where the recognisance is founded on a complaint charging a specified offence, the terms of the act itself exclude any other. The 3d clause of the 26th section appropriates so much of the recognisance as will pay ‘ the damage sustained by any person, by reason of the commission of <em>such </em>crime or misdemeanor.’ What crime or misdemeanor ? The 25th section informs us, it is ‘ where recognisances have been taken for the appearance of persons <em>charged </em>with the commission of any crime or misdemeanor, before any court, to answer <em>such charge </em>;’ and it makes it lawful for any person, having suffered loss or injury by the commission of <em>such </em>crime or misdemeanor,- ‘ to institute <a id="p167" href="#p167" data-label="167" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*167</a>suit on the recognisance,’ &amp;c. Nothing can he clearer than that, by the very terms of the law, the right to claim a part of the recognisance is confined to thé' party injured by the specific offence charged, upon which <em>the </em>recognisance is founded. If, however, the bill of indictment afterwards preferred were to govern, then even different persons could come in on the fund, or even the same person for different offences; for, in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Gilaspie, 7 <em>8. R. </em>469, it has been decided, that several persons may he charged in the same indictment for different offences. Wagonseller was charged witlr the embezzlement of $27,000 of the notes of the bank, and gave bail to the justice to answer this specific charge. He never appeared in court to answer this charge. After giving bail, thd'bank gave him notice it intended to introduce into the indictment other embezzlements; but how could this extend the terms of the recognisance, or change the language of the law? Upon his appearance, possibly, the surcharge might be maintained, but his non-appearance threw the bank on the terms of his recognisance, and they were limited to the embezzlement of the <em>notes, </em>of which we have seen all but $500 were returned, leaving the loss only $500 and interest.</p>

But while true in a limited, this is not true in a universal extent, as is shown by abundant authority: <em>Angelí jp Ames on Corporations, </em>c. 18, § 7, p. 523; Rex <em>v. </em>Patrick, 1 <em>Leach, C. L. </em>253; People <em>v. </em>Corporation of Albany, <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Wend.%20539" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="11 Wend. 539">11 <em>Wendell </em>539</a>; Stevens <em>v. </em>Midland Counties Railroad, <em>Livingston’s Law Mag. </em>1855, p. 517, citing Regina <em>v. </em>Birmingham Railway Company, 3 <em>Q.

In this last case, it was held, that a corporation could be held liable in an action- for a malicious prosecution. But the question here is' not, whether a corporation can prosecute or be prosecuted for an offence. . It- is simply, can a corporation suffer loss or injury by the commission of a crime or misdemeanor. The act gives this portion of the recognisance to the <em>injured party, </em>not to the <em>prosecutor. </em>Surely a corporation is injured whose property is stolen or embezzled. The case of The School Directors <em>v. </em>Carlisle Bank, <a href="/watts/8/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Watts 289" data-case-ids="1848407" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0289-01">8 <em>Watts </em>289</a>, is cited to prove that ‘ person’ in the act, means a natural person. That case is good authority for what it decides, that owing to the effect it would cause, to wit, double taxation, the stock of a bank is not taxable under the Act of 25th March 1831. But the judge who delivers <a id="p168" href="#p168" data-label="168" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*168</a>the opinion concedes the very point, saying: ‘ Although it cannot be denied but that the bank being a corporation, and therefore a <em>person </em>in contemplation of law, <em>may be included by the use of the term person, </em>yet, in the construction of statutes, the terms or language thereof are to be taken and understood according to their ordinary and usual signification, as they are generally understood among mankind, unless it should appear from the context and other parts of the statute to have been intended otherwise; and if so, the intention of the legislature, whatever it may be, ought to prevail.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b168-6" data-blocks='[["BL_168.4",168,[299,800,1161,644]]]'>“ The law on this point is clearly stated in <em>Angelí Ames on Corporations, </em>c. 8, p. 195: ‘ Neither is it necessary that corporations <em>eo nomine </em>should be embraced within the terms of an act, to subject them to its prohibitions, since it is well settled, that the words <em>inhabitants, </em>occupiers or <em>persons, </em>may include incorporated companies.’ See authorities cited — also <em><a href="/watts/8/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Watts 289" data-case-ids="1848407" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0289-01">Id.</a> </em>c. 11, p. 322; c. 13, p. 368. See also Congreve <em>et al. v. </em>National Protection Insurance Company, <em>Livingston’s Law Mag. </em>1855, p. 650. The Act of 1842 is remedial, giving a compensation for injury. Surely, the stockholders of a corporation, whether for charitable, literary, religious, or pecuniary purposes, are as much injured by a larceny of their property, as the same persons would be in their natural capacity. And what difference is there between larceny and embezzlement in the loss suffered ? We are satisfied, therefore, that the bank is an injured person, within the meaning of the act.</p>

Seemingly, the opinion of Justice Black, in that case, might appear to sustain the objection; but, rightly considered, nothing will be found in it which decides the question before us. The portion of the opinion referred to by counsel, is but a dictum, founded upon a different law — that of 1846, relating to Philadelphia; which is wanting in the prominent -features of the Act of 1842, that lead to and unfold its true meaning. In the portion alluded to, Justice Black, after a just exposition of the terms of the Act of 1846, as to the character of the injury or loss suffered, concludes by restricting the compensation ‘ to cases in which restitution or payment to the injured party is included in the criminal sentence, as, for instance, larceny or bastardy.’ A narrow circle indeed, for we remember no other in which restitution by way of payment is part of the sentence— <em>land </em>only being the subject of restitution in forcible entry and detainer.</p>

The claimant was no party injured by the offence charged; and his damages were only remote and consequential, not directly proceeding from the offence itself. And, <a id="p169" href="#p169" data-label="169" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*169</a>secondly-, his loss was voluntary, and incurred in the prosecution of an illegal act, and therefore not recoverable. That case arose under the Act of 22d April 1846; which applies to Philadelphia city and county alone, .and is wanting in important features of the Act of 1842. No provision is made in it for the prosecution of suit on the recognisance by the party suffering loss or injury— none for the assessment of the damages, and none for notice to the injured party before remitting recognisance; all of which are found in the Act of 1842. The absénce of any apparent intention on the part of the legislature to give an interest generally to all injured parties, and of a means whereby the damages could he assessed, might alone have seemed to warrant the conclusion that the remedy was to be confined to cases wherein the sentence itself fixed the restitution. But the provision in the Act of 1842, which gives <em>any person </em>the right to sue and proceed to final judgment upon any forfeited recognisance for <em>any crime </em>or misdemeanor ; the provision for an auditor to assess the damages sustained by <em>any person </em>claiming a part of <em>any recognisance </em>so forfeited, with power to administer oaths and to report the testimony ; the power of the court to order a re-examination, and the finality and conclusiveness of the 'decree of the court, and the further provision that the recognisance shall not be remitted without notice to the injured party, all tend to show that the legislative intent was as broad as the language in which it was couched; and that distinctly and clearly gives a general remedy to the injured party, in all cases where pecuniary loss or injury at least has been suffered. Had the Act of 1842 been before the learned judge, he never could have supposed for an instant that the legislature intended to narrow down the claim to larceny and bastardy. How could he ? The language of the act is general and express, and its provisions indicate an intent as general. Nor can courts legislate away the clearly expressed words of a law. The settled rule of interpretation of statutes, is, to abide by the words used, unless a contrary intention is manifest from the context, the nature of the subject-matter, or the scope, object, or effect.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b169-6" data-blocks='[["BL_169.4",169,[175,1924,1167,471]],["BL_170.1",170,[315,374,1168,714]]]'>“ In what part of the Act of 1842 is there an expression leading to the belief that the legislature did not mean that the remedy should he as general as its language, at least so far as pecuniary loss is involved ? Did the learned judge, in the expressions, ‘ we can say this only of cases in which restitution or payment to the injured party is included in the criminal sentence,’ arguing <em>ab inconvenienti, </em>mean that the damage <em>must </em>be first fixed by a conviction and sentence ? If he did, then the statute is a most ‘ lame and impotent conclusion,’ indeed. Conviction without sentence is nothing, for the jury pass only on the allegation in the indictment, and sentence alone awards the restitution or payment. But the <a id="p170" href="#p170" data-label="170" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*170</a>defendant must be in court to be sentenced, and then the recognisance is not forfeited; or if forfeited, he must be arrested, tried and sentenced, before restitution can be legally ascertained. And what then becomes of that most numerous class of recognisances forfeited before appearance, where the offender never appears or is tried? The Act of 1846, under the consideration of Judge Black, gives no answer, but that of 1842 does in explicit terms. The court shall appoint an auditor to <em>assess the damage </em>and report the testimony, and the court may re-examine his proceedings, and decide the case finally. Sentence has nothing to do with this proceeding, but the law without conviction furnishes the means— ‘ definitely to ascertain and fix the claim (of the party injured) by the very evidence which proves the offence against the public;’ ,and we may add, by any other evidence which proves the loss or injury; for the auditor is ‘to report the testimony taken before him, together with a statement of the amount of damages sustained by the claimant.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b170-6" data-blocks='[["BL_170.4",170,[308,1100,1170,1158]]]'>“ The judge argues that satisfaction taken out of the recognisance would be to confound the indictment and the civil suit, and to assess damages without a jury in the absence of the defendant. This may be a proper judicial inference from the Act of 1846; but the Act of 1842 expressly refers it to the decision of an auditor, and what difference is there in favour of an absconding criminal, and against a defaulting defendant in a civil proceeding ? and yet we daily assess damages against the latter upon the affidavit of the plaintiff, through auditors, and by inquests of office. He says also it would create antagonism between the county and the person wronged, by making it the interest of the public to deny or extenuate the guilt of the criminal. But not so; the guilt is admitted by non-appearance, so far as <em>it </em>may be involved in the distribution. The question then is, not how guilty the criminal, but how much injury he whom he wronged has suffered. The judge suggests, also, difficulties as to the effect of a pardon, and a set-off of the sum received in a future civil action; and concludes, — ‘It is impossible to believe that the legislature ever intended to create such a tissue of anomalies.’ But it must not be forgotten the legislature did do this very thing, to the extent of the number of admitted cases. In these cases, those anomalies must arise and must be met; while the true question is only, whether they shall extend to a larger number. A change in the law often brings new questions, difficult of solution; the $300 exemption law, for example. But this must not defeat the law, especially in cases like the present, where the interest is expressed in clear and intelligible language.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b170-7" data-blocks='[["BL_170.5",170,[308,2258,1163,129]],["BL_171.1",171,[175,375,1168,1160]]]'>“ It is argued, that it cannot be supposed the legislature intended to let in upon the recognisance one who has suffered from a <em>pure tort■ </em>capable of no pecuniary standard of measurement, such as <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>libel or a battery. This may be so, and we are willing to take it for granted for the purpose of the argument; the term interest, in the act, allowing the claim, indicating perhaps an intent to restrict it to a loss or injury of property, capable of a pecuniary standard of measurement. We have no objection to this interpretation, and thus to let the argument <em>ab inconvenienti </em>begin where the obvious and easy standard of damages ends. We can therefore easily acquiesce in that part of the opinion of Judge Black, which was probably that also of the court, that the word damages was not used in its technical sense, but was intended to signify the just and legal claim of one who has been directly injured by the commission of the crime, and at the same time a claim definitely ascertained, and fixed by the very evidence which favours the offence against the public. But while all this may be admitted as fixing the true meaning of the law, and the just boundaries of its intention; yet we think it was wholly an inadvertence, and a <em>non sequitur, </em>when the learned judge added, ‘ we can say this only of cases in which restitution or payment to the injured party is included in the criminal sentence, as for instance larceny or bastardy.’ By this superadded qualification a limit was introduced too narrow for practical utility, uncalled for by the clear and appropriate definition of the right just preceding, insufficient to prevent inconvenience in all cases'of forfeiture before conviction and sentence; and finally at variance with the plain language and manifest intent of the Act of 1842, giving any injured party a right to prosecute any recognisance, an auditor to assess his damages, and a right to notice beffore Remission.</p>

The goods and money in the latter are as certain and capable of precise assessment, as in larceny. The evidence to prove the one, is as much the very evidence which proves the offence against the public, as that which proves the other. Indeed, it is more so than in the case of bastardy. In that, the order of affiliation is not founded on the evidence which proves the fornication and bastardy; but is made by the justices of the sessions, under the Act of Assembly, ‘upon conviction,’ the ‘maintenance’ being such as <em>they </em>‘shall direct and appoint.’ On what principle of equity or justice, or of sound reason and policy of law, should the man who has lost his goods or his money by false pretences, or by embezzlement, be forbidden to participate in the recognisance, while he whose property has been stolen, or the mother of the ^bastard, may come in ?
