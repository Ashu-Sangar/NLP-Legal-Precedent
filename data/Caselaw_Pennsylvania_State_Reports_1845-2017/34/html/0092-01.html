It was necessary, however, in such cases, that the execution should be <em>tested </em>as of a day when he was living. Rut such an execution gave the plaintiff no preference over other creditors, for, as to these, a seizure itself under the execution created no lien: see particularly Leiper <em>v. </em>Levis, 15 <em>S. f R. </em>112.</p>

      <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>“ The revisers of the code, referring to this state of the law in their report, proposed to abrogate it, and for that purpose reported what was subsequently adopted by the legislature, and stands as the principal part of the 33d section of the above act. It reads thus: ‘ No execution for the levy or sale of any real or personal estate of any decedent, shall be issued upon any judgment obtained against him in his lifetime, unless his personal representatives have been first warned by a writ of <em>scire facias </em>to show cause against the issuing thereof, notwithstanding the <em>teste </em>of such execution may bear date antecedent to his death.’ This statutory provision has given rise to the present writ of error. The plea <em>in nullo est erratum </em>confesses the fact of the priority of Wood’s death to the exit of the <em>venditioni exponas; </em>and the question is, does the statute forbid resort to this writ (unless preceded by a <em>scire facias) </em>when the purpose is to enforce a <em>lien </em>which is not derived from a <em>judgment, </em>but resulted upon the issuing of a <em>testatum fi. fa., </em>and the observance of certain peculiar directions of an Act of Assembly in regard to it.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b94-7" data-blocks='[["BL_94.5",94,[309,1640,1161,473]]]'>“In regard to the lien of a judgment recovered in the lifetime of one who dies before an execution has issued upon it, it not only endures five years from its date without regard to the continuance in life of the defendant, but it may be revived again and again at the option of the plaintiff until paid; whilst the lien created by a <em>testatum fi. fa. </em>is a special one, is limited to five years, and is incapable of a further extension; if a <em>scire facias </em>to the executor or administrator must issue and be finally disposed of. before a <em>venditioni exponas </em>can be resorted to, it may be in the power of the legal representatives of the decedent to keep up a sham contest until the lien shall have expired.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b94-8" data-blocks='[["BL_94.6",94,[311,2114,1159,127]]]'>“ These considerations constitute a strong reason for holding that the case of a <em>testatum, fi. fa. </em>was not in the mind of the legislature in adopting the Act of 1834.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b94-9" data-blocks='[["BL_94.7",94,[312,2242,1161,172]],["BL_95.1",95,[194,387,1170,605]]]'>“ But there is another ground which favours, if it does not force, the conclusion, that a <em>venditioni exponas </em>is not forbidden by that statute. This writ is not properly a separate integral process of execution. It is rather part and parcel of a <em>fi. fá.: </em>where per<a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>sonal property is seized, it is never necessary. The <em>fi. fa. </em>gives the lien upon such property, the only lien which a judgment-creditor can, <em>in invitum, </em>acquire upon it, and a sale may take place under it as well after as before the return day. When a <em>venditioni </em>is also issued in such ease, its purpose is merely to quicken the sheriff. The relation which a <em>venditioni exponas </em>holds to a <em>fi. fa. </em>when <em>real estate </em>is the subject to be affected, is not essentially different. This is well stated by Chief Justice Gibson, in Springer <em>v. </em>Brown, 9 <em>Barr </em>307. Our statutory <em>venditioni </em>exponas, says the Chief Justice, for the sale of land is borrowed from the common law writ for the sale of chattels, and is preserved only because the sheriff, being bound to require an inquisition, cannot sell on the <em>fieri facias </em>without a waiver of it; <em>it is equally an ancillary part of </em>the machinery of execution.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b95-6" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[196,991,1168,860]]]'>“ According to the practice anterior to the statute of 1834, it was the <em>fi. fa. </em>only which was required to be <em>tested before </em>the death of the defendant. The <em>venditioni </em>might issue as well after as before, without any attention to the death. In fact, as it could not be sued out until <em>the fi. fa. </em>had been <em>returned, </em>it could in no such case be properly tested before the death, and this shows that the provisions of the 33d section of the Act of 1834 were not designed to comprehend a <em>venditioni exponas, </em>even where the lien to be enforced was founded upon a mere judgment. To the objection that the Act of 1834 speaks of an execution for the <em>levy </em>or sale, and that this seems to point where land is to be affected to both a <em>fi. fa. </em>and <em>venditioni exponas, </em>it may be answered that this language is satisfied by applying writ <em>for sale </em>to a <em>levari facias, </em>which is an integral writ of itself, and requires no preliminary one to found it upon. Indeed, in technical strictness, and this the etymology proves, <em>levy </em>includes a <em>sale: </em>Drewe <em>v. </em>Lainson, 11 <em>A. B. </em>529. But it is often used, both here and in England, in the limited sense of' a <em>seizure </em>only: Alehin <em>v. </em>Wells, 5 <em>B. B. </em>470. And this seems to be the meaning of the statute of 1834, and refers to a <em>fi. fa.</em>
