Three commissioners, appointed by the governor, were to fix upon a proper and convenient site, for a court-house, prison, and county offices, within said county, and by a written report to the governor were to certify, describe, and limit the site or lot of land which they shall have chosen for the purpose aforesaid; and the commissioners of the county to he elected at the next general election, were authorized to take assurance to them and their successors in office, of such lot or piece of ground thus approved, for the purpose of erecting thereon a court-house, jail, and offices for the safe keeping of the records: and they were also authorized to assess, <a id="p135" href="#p135" data-label="135" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*135</a>levy, and collect, in the manner directed for raising county rates and levies, a sufficient sum to defray the expenses thereof.</p>

The circumstances of the case clearly show that Mr. See-bold must have made an offer of this portion of his land, as a site, for subscriptions were taken up in New Berlin, and different parts of the county, to defray the expense of erecting a courthouse on the ground. The court-house was built, principally, by these subscriptions, Mr. Seebold contributing one or two hundred dollars, and a further advance of four hundred and sixty dollars, above the amount subscribed, was subsequently repaid by the county of Union.</p>

The grant in the premises 'is to the commissioners by name and their successors in office, commissioners of the county of Union, “ in trust for the use of the said county, in fee simple,” of the land described by metes and bounds, together with the brick court-house thereon erected — and the <em>habendum, </em>uses the same language ; so that there is no other use or trust declared than that for the county of Union in fee simple, making it in fact the absolute equitable owner of the whole estate in the land. It will be seen, that this deed passed not only the naked lot which belonged to Mr. Seebold, but the brick court-house built by citizens of the county of Union, upon the clear understanding that the land and its valuable erections were to be conveyed to the use of the county, <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>•without restriction, condition, or limitation. It never could have entered into their calculations, that in any event the court-house, and all the county improvements on the lot, should become the property of Mr. Seebold or his heirs, by any forced construction of the terms employed by the grantor, in conveying his and their interest in the land and building.</p>

New Market street was laid out through the county lot, and a part of the same was reconveyed to Seebold in exchange for another lot of his lying north of the lot on which the jail was to be erected. This exchange was mutually beneficial, the strip conveyed to See-bold giving a front to his other lots on the street.</p>

The trustees advertised the court-house, jail, and other buildings and lands belonging to the county, for sale, and the <a id="p137" href="#p137" data-label="137" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*137</a>plaintiffs, heirs of Christopher Seebold, deceased, brought two ejectments, one for the lot on which the court-house and offices were erected, containing an acre and a quarter, and the other for the jail lot and jail erected on it, containing one-fourth of an acre; alleging that inasmuch as the courts were no longer held in New Berlin, nor the jail used for the confinement of prisoners, that both lots with all the buildings upon them, reverted back to them as the heirs of the original grantor.</p>

    <p id="b137-7" data-blocks='[["BL_137.5",137,[183,817,1171,778]]]'>The provision in the Act of 8th March 1815, is that a full and sufficient deed in fee simple shall be tendered to the commissioners, and no conveyance for any less estate, or for a limited fee, clogged and confined with conditions or qualifications of any sort, would have fulfilled the requirements of the legislature; accordingly, the grantors use in strict conformity to the legislative will, the very same clear and expressive language in their deed to the county commissioners, which gave to the county of Union an absolute estate in fee simple. But it is said, there was no valuable consideration for this conveyance. This is a mistake, for the legislature fixed the price, which was accepted by Mr. Seebold, and received by him in full, having been paid to him under an order by the commissioners of the county on the county treashrer, in the usual form; Kerlin <em>v. </em>Campbell, 3 <em>Harris </em>500; any other construction would make the deed a fraud upon the citizens who erected the court-house, and upon the county that erected afterwards the county offices, and the county jail, by a large expenditure of the county funds.</p>
    <p id="b137-8" data-blocks='[["BL_137.6",137,[183,1594,1171,514]]]'>It would indeed be a strange result, that after forty years’ uninterrupted possession by the county of Union, under a conveyance from the ancestor in fee simple, it should be found that, when, under the sanction of the legislature, these lots and buildings are to be sold as the property of the county of Union, for the benefit of all those residing within her ancient limits, they belong to the 'heirs of Christopher Seebold, a man who neither erected the court-house, county offices, or jail. Could it have been contemplated by any one, that these individuals, by virtue of any residuary or reversionary interest of any kind left in their ancestor, should become the only legitimate occupants of the jail and public buildings of the county of Union ?</p>
    <p id="b137-9" data-blocks='[["BL_137.7",137,[184,2107,1170,303]]]'>This cannot be the law, and we are therefore of opinion that whether with or without the parol evidence introduced upon the trial, the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover in either case. The case of the jail lot is perhaps stronger than the other, as a part of it was conveyed in exchange for a portion of the jail lot, in pursuance of a special act of the legislature, and the transaction was especially beneficial to their ancestor.</p>
