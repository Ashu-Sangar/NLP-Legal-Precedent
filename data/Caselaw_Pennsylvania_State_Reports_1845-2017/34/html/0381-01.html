    <p class="summary" id="b381-7" data-blocks='[["BL_381.8",381,[218,943,1159,257]]]'>This was a bill in equity, exhibited by Martin Warfel against Robert Cochran, Samuel M. Brown, and George W. Brecht, road commissioners of'Mill Creek township, and Daniel Young, for an injunction to restrain the defendants from damming up and obstructing a brook or creek, which ran across a public highway, called East Lane, adjoining the farm of the complainant. *</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b381-8" data-blocks='[["BL_381.9",381,[218,1201,1160,344]]]'>The bill averred that the brook had run in this channel for at least twenty-eight years; and that the authorities of Mill Creek township, with a view of oppressing and injuring the complainant, had determined to fill up and wholly obstruct the channel thereof, adjoining his premises; and had been and were encroaching upon his land and fences, to his great, manifest, immediate, and permanent injury; and prayed for an.injunction to restrain them from so doing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b381-9" data-blocks='[["BL_381.10",381,[218,1544,1160,599]]]'>The defendants, by their answer, set forth that by reason of the brook in question crossing the public highway, at the point mentioned in the complainant’s bill, it had washed out and gullied the road in such manner as greatly to incommode, and become dangerous to travellers; and that the respondents were about repairing the said road, and putting the same in a condition for public use. That in order to do so, it was necessary to fill up the channel cut by the brook, on the west side of the road, and across East Lane; and to turn the stream down near the east line of East Lane, to a suitable culvert across the Ridge Road, passing the water into the present channel north of the Ridge Road ; according to a plan adopted and intended to be carried out by them. And that Daniel Young and others had been employed by the road commissioners to perform the work.</p>

But it was found, or at least supposed to be, by the law-making power, that cases did arise which required more speedy and prompt action to prevent wrong irreparable in the regular course of law. The legislature, by the Act of the 16th June 1836, in the fifth clause of the thirteenth section, conferred certain equity powers on the District Court and Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia, in order to provide against such cases; as it was found the injury either could not be repaired at all, at iaw, or when it even could be, would necessarily be entirely inadequate, or be so tardy as to amount to a denial of justice. The same powers are extended by the Act of 21st April 1854, to the courts in the sixth judicial district.</p>

In the case before us, although there is much variety, and some conflict between the witnesses, yet there is really substantially no conflict as to the main, material facts. It is apparent, from all the evidence, and from a personal examination we made upon the ground, that the location of the road, on East Lane, has been substantially the same, as at the time of committing the injury, as claimed by this bill, for a long period, perhaps twenty-five or thirty years, certainly more than twenty-one years, with the water crossing it, under a small bridge or culvert, entering East Lane at the east, and running across until it reaches near the western side, and thence northwardly across the Buffalo Road, under a small bridge on that road. That the respondents undertook to change this location, so far as the small stream of water was concerned, by stopping the water at or about the eastern line of the lane, by filling up the watercourse, and driving it into the complainant’s field. This is the injury complained of, and to prevent the further commission of which, we are asked by the bill to restrain and prevent. If the act is wrong, it is an act <em>contrary to law, </em>and therefore within the provisions of the Act of Assembly. The distinction has been well taken by defendants’ counsel, between the general powers of a Court of Chancery in England, and those conferred upon the common law courts under our Acts of Assembly. In the former, an act contrary to either equity or law, may be restrained ; the latter is limited to acts done <em>contrary to </em>law. <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>A number of eases have been pressed by the defendants’ counsel upon our consideration with much ingenuity, but we think not sufficient to control the decision of this case. We think the injury here comes clearly within the class mentioned in one of the cases cited: Hagner <em>v. </em>Heyberger, 7 <em>W. $ S. </em>104, 107.</p>

However long it may have crossed the road in a given manner, it may be changed to meet the demands of public convenience.
