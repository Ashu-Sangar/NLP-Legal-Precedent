The street out of repair, and over which the Cumberland Road passes, was never anything, since it was laid out, but a street of the borough of Uniontown, and was never vacated or superseded by the road : and whatever engagements may exist between the road and borough authorities to keep the same in repair, it is clearly not competent for the borough officers to intervene them, so as to release them from the primary obligations to the public: 10 <em>Png. Q. L. Rep. </em>310.</p>

It is contended, upon recognised authority, that this writ can only be invoked in cases of the last necessity, and not where there is another effectual remedy: <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20196" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Jones 196">1 <em>Jones </em>196</a>. It cannot be questioned, that an indict? <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>ment would lie against the borough authorities for suffering the street to remain out of repair, as described in the petition, and this remedy might be effectual. It is true, it could be pardoned, but this is not to be anticipated.' 'This kind of remedy by indictment would be quite legitimate to nuisances in the streets, created by one or more persons to the -hindrance and obstruction of the whole community; but it does not s.eem to be so entirely applicable to a nuisance of the kind described'in the petition, and which has been created by the negligence of the proper authorities. There is tio such thing as abating such a nuisance, by the mere act of the parties incommoded. To compel the proper authorities to do so, is the very object of the proceeding. The public, and those more particularly interested, must resort to some legal remedy against those bound to repair. If the nuisance complained of was strictly a public one, and' the relator had no more ground to complain of it than others, we think we would have been compelled to sustain the demurrer.' But the relator states in his petition that he owns houses within the limits of the borough, on both ■sides of the street, where the nuisance exists, and that he, with his family, resides in one of these, houses; that, in consequence of the dilapidated, rough, uneven, and muddy state of the street, it has become inconvenient, unsafe, and dangerous to pass along or across the same, and that he and the public are, notwithstanding, obliged to cross and pass along the same. This, by the demurrer, is all admitted; whereby it appears that the relator has sustained a special injury, for which he might resort to a civil, not a criminal action, which would not afford that <em>effectual remedy </em>which he has a right to demand.</p>

Of common right, the borough is bound to keep its streets in repair. There was, for awhile, a substituted conservator of Main street, because it was part of the National Road. When and in so far as that has failed, the primary and principal duty of the borough is revived. The return does not deny that the repair is needed, and does not aver that there is any other functionary who has funds in his possession or power which he is bound to apply to that purpose. The case of the King <em>v. </em>Oxfordshire, 4 <em>B. &amp; C. </em>194, 10 <em>Eng. C. L. R. </em>310, was decided on these principles.</p>
    <p id="b296-6" data-blocks='[["BL_296.7",296,[301,926,1162,554]]]'>And we think this is a proper form of remedy. Possibly, it would not be allowed, where the necessity of the repair is the matter in dispute; but, where only the liability is in issue, we see no objection to it. Certainly, the courts have power to compel, in some form, the performance of the duty; and we have no form so good as this, and since it can now be administered by the Common Pleas for local cases, we have no good reason for restricting its operation. We must restrict it as an original remedy in this court; else we shall be unable to do our business as a court of error. That the proper remedy has been adopted here, will be seen by <em>Tapping on Mandamus </em>18, 24, 60, 131, and the cases there cited. We ought to have had the writ on our paper-books, but the parties have raised no question on it.</p>
