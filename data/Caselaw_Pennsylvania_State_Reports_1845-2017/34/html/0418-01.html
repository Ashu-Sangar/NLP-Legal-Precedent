J.) charged the jury as follows:— “ The principal point which the plaintiff makes is this, that his father George Hertzog, at his instance, became the purchaser of the Dr. Drown tract of land for him, he undertaking and agreeing to pay the purchase-money; that he did provide a considerable portion of the means to pay for the land, but, inasmuch as he failed to pay the whole, his father, as trustee, held the purchase in his own name, and died without executing the trust; that the plaintiff then decided not to require from the executor the execution of the trust, but allowed it to be treated as a part of the estate of his father, and to be portioned among his heirs, and under this state of facts, he is entitled to recover the value of the tract at the time of the death of his father, deducting therefrom what has been paid by his father. We are of opinion, that a recovery cannot be had upon this basis. The plaintiff cannot turn round on his heel, and say to the trustee, I find I am unable to pay all I promised you to pay, but keep the land, pay me its full value, and I will allow you what you have paid. The most he can be entitled to, where there has been a failure of this kind, or where the trust had been mutually abrogated, would be, if the trustee keeps the property, to require him to pay what had been contributed by the <em>cestui que trust.</em>

But such actions were rare in the early history of our jurisprudence; and when they were brought, the measure of damages, though not very distinctly defined in the cases, was so controlled, that specific performance of the contract should not be virtually enforced. It is too manifest for debate, that if the value of the land may be recovered in an action of case upon the parol contract, the statute, as we have it, is as effectually evaded, as if the land itself were recovered in ejectment. Therefore it was, that whilst the personal action was sustained, because forbidden by nothing in our statute, the damages recovered were measured by other standards than the value of the land at the time of the recovery. In some of the early cases, it would seem, the damages were merely nominal; in none, were they more than compensatory of what had been paid on the footing of the contract.</p>
    <p id="b420-5" data-blocks='[["BL_420.3",420,[328,377,1158,774]]]'>
      <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>The rule was indemnity — compensation for what had been paid or done — restoration of the parties to their condition before the contract was made. And this rule was agreeable to that which prevailed in England and Pennsylvania, in respect to breach of written executory contracts, and that also which was always applied to covenants of seisin, covenants for quiet enjoyment, and covenants against encumbrances, and for further assurance, in deeds of conveyance, or other executed contracts. Where there was no fraud, misrepresentation, or wrongful suppression of facts on the part of the vendor, but he was simply unable to convey the title stipulated for, or to defend his alienee in the possession granted, he was liable to restore the purchase-money received with interest, but not to compensate the vendee for improvements made, or for accretions, from any cause, in the value of the estate. In a word, the measure of damages for breach of real contracts was to be looked for, not in the value of the estate at the time of breach, or eviction, but in the consideration which had passed betwmen the contracting parties.</p>
    <p id="b420-6" data-blocks='[["BL_420.4",420,[331,1150,1158,939]]]'>At length, cases began to make their appearance, in which land was promised, not for moneys paid, but for services rendered and to be rendered during the life of the promissor — such as a housekeeper usually renders to the employer, or a child to a parent. The quantum of services stipulated for in such cases, being necessarily uncertain, their value could not be ascertained beforehand. And as the parties had fixed their value by bargaining for a particular piece of land, when the action came for breach of the contract, it was argued, that nothing but the full value of that particular piece of land could indemnify the disappointed vendee. This class of contracts, though resting in parol, was regarded as so peculiarly meritorious, that the ordinary rule of compensation was departed from, and another adopted which had no precedent or analogies in the law of vendor and vendee. The value of the land, at the time of eviction or breach of promise, was held to be the measure. No attention was paid to the intrinsic and essential value of the services rendered, and none to the statute of frauds and perjuries. The case of Jack <em>v. </em>McKee, 9 <em>Barr </em>235, was the first of this type that made its appearance in our books. It was followed by Bash <em>v. </em>Bash, <em>Id. </em>260; by Oyer <em>v. </em>McDowell, 9 <em>Harris 4</em>17; by Beach <em>v. </em>McClintock (not reported), and by Malaun <em>v. </em>Ammon, 1 <em>Grant’s Cases </em>123.</p>

The question is always brought under discussion, after- the services have been .rendered, and when they are therefore capable of exact description. However uncertain they may be, when agreed for, they are never uncertain as matter of judicial investigation, for they are past and known. Now that a jury is competent to assess the value' of past services is proved by every day’s experience in court. That they are as competent to perform this duty as to assess the value of land, will scarcely be denied. Why, then, it may be asked, should this class of. cases be taken out of the general rule, that applies to other contracts for land both executory and executed ? Why should the investigation be directed to the <em>value of the bargain, </em>in direct contravention of the rule in written contracts, instead of being- directed to the <em>consideration of the bargain, </em>as in those cases ? And why should there be virtual performance of a parol contract' for land, the consideration being services performed, when we will not enforce performance, either actual or virtual, of parol contracts, the consideration of which has been paid in money ?</p>

The disastrous effects of Jack <em>v. </em>McKee were fully shown in the subsequent cases of Beach <em>v. </em>MeClintock, and Malaun <em>v. </em>Ammon. In Beach’s case a grandson, whose services, as claimed by himself, did not exceed in value $1800, was permitted to recover a judgment against the administrator of his grandfather for nearly $10,000, which swept the fairest portion of old Nathan Beach’s estate from his right heirs. In Malaun’s case the entire estate of the decedent, real and personal, was taken from the heir-at-law, and given to a woman whose services, had they been the subject of compensation, would probably have taken but a very small portion of the estate, if indeed any of it, in addition to what had already been given her by her benefactress.</p>

The contract was left in parol, and depended, so far as the land was concerned, on the uncorroborated testimony of a single female witness. Unconscious of any claim to his land, Jack devised it to his brother, and died. Several witnesses spoke of Jack’s promise's to compensate Ann’s services, but Elizabeth McG-arr was the only witness who proved a contract to give the <em>land. </em>Whether her testimony was direct and positive, or'only inferential, I have no means of knowing, as it is not furnished ; but there was a paper in evidence (the only written evidence), which tended strongly to contradict her. What she testified to must have been heard not later than May 1842, for she stated, that she had not been in the testator’s house after that date. The paper referred to wras a sealed note of Matthew Jack, dated the 17th September 1842, acknowledging himself indebted to Miss Ann McKee in $288, “ exclusive of former notes,” and expressly stated to be “on final settlement.” The judge instructed the jury, that the measure of damages for the special contract, if proved, was the value- of the land, and referred it to them to find whether her Services were embraced in the settlement of September 1842. They found in her favour, and gave her the value of the land in damages, which' ruling the Supreme Court affirmed, in an opinion delivered by Mr. Justice Rogers.</p>

This also was an action on a parol contract to compensate the services of a son by the gift of a specific farm. The judge had held, that evidence to establish a contract between father and son, need not be stronger than between strangers, and that if it was “ clear and satisfactory,” it need not be “ direct and positive.” Chief Justice Gibson, taking the rule as to the measure of damages from Judge Rogers, in Jack <em>v. </em>McKee, without examination, proceeded to reverse the judgment, on the ground that the evidence in such cases should be direct and positive, and that there was no such proof in the case. By direct and positive proof, I understand, the testimony of a witness who was present when the bargain was made, and heard the parties contract, as contradistinguished from those casual allusions to it, and those testamentary purposes and intentions, which witnesses often hear one of the parties express in the absence of the other. Now, besides a good deal of this latter kind of evidence, in Bash <em>v. </em>Bash, one witness stated, that he was present when the parties, father and son, .were at work on the farm, and he heard the son say: “We have more hard work than we are able to get through with.” His father replied: “ Don’t be discouraged — you shall be paid for all the hard work you do for <em>me </em>— I <em>will leave you this </em>place— I hope you will live to see the day you will enjoy it.” I doubt, if there was any evidence in Jack <em>v. </em>McKee, more <em>direct and positive </em>than this; and yet this, in connection with distinct admissions and corroborating circumstances, was held, by at least a moiety of the court, as insufficient in Bash <em>v. </em>Bash, whilst Eliza* beth McGarr’s uncorroborated and contradicted testimony was held sufficient in Jack <em>v. </em>McKee.</p>

This was probably the reason why he took the rule from Judge Rogers, without sifting it, for I have found no case in which he seems to have vindicated or justified such a rule. Before Jack <em>v. </em>McKee, actions for breach of parol contracts had often been brought, and the damages had been regulated by the circumstances of each case, generally, by the price paid, or services rendered; never in a single instance, that I have found, by the value of the land. And had the mind of the Chief Justice been drawn to the subject, as the <em>principal </em>point, in Bash <em>v. </em>Bash, it would most certainly have recurred to the antecedent course of decision, instead of resting on the ill-supported and novel rule of Judge.

The one is personal property, which passes by delivery, and perishes with the using; the other, real estate, which grows more valuable with time, and which requires something more than delivery of possession to pass the title. From the time that Jeremiah bought the field'of Hanameel, “ and subscribed the evidence <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances,” (Jer. xxxii. 10), down through the whole Jewish history, through polished Greece and Rome, and among the barbarians of the North, the Goths, the Swedes, the Saxons — nay, among all nations, at all times, wherever property has been claimed and transferred in land, some solemnities have been observed, more than were necessary in bargains about personalty. It has been a writing, a shoe plucked off, a clod, a turf, a staff, or some visible memorial of the transaction, that was deemed necessary to solemnize a contract about land. With us, statutes prescribe deeds, seals, acknowledgments, and registries, as evidence of land contracts; and an ancient statute, borrowed from England, the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries, <em>which is the panoply of every land-owner in Pennsylvania, </em>sets aside and avoids all contracts about land, for more than a three <em>years’ </em>lease, which are not reduced to writing. Now, notwithstanding all this, Judge Rogers puts a contract about land, .on a footing with a contract about a horse, and then refers to this incongruous conjunction, as the <em>principle </em>on which the ruling in Jack <em>v. </em>McKee was grounded.</p>

By the <em>“ </em>value of the land,” Judge Rogers does not mean the value at the time of the making the contract, but at the time of its breach. This is evident, from the manner of applying the rule in Jack <em>v. </em>McKee, and subsequent cases. If the value at the time of making the contract were intended, the consideration paid ■would be, as between the parties, the measure of <em>that </em>value, and this is the very standard of damages for which I contend. But the value at time of breach, is what Judge Rogers sets up as the standard, “ because that is the stipulated reward of the services of B., whatever may be their intrinsic value more or less.” As to the expression, “ certain services of uncertain value,” we must be careful that we are not cheated by sounds. It is the constant business of juries, to ascertain and assess the value of services, whose price is not fixed, and certainly not a more delicate duty, than to ascertain and assess the value of land.</p>

Without combating the rule of Judge Rogers, in its application to horses and other personal property, I deny it to be law, as to land, either in England, in Pennsylvania, or in most of the states of this Union. An examination of the authorities will establish, beyond cavil, the following propositions: That in actions on <em>covenants of seisin, </em>the measure of damages is the real consideration paid. That mentioned in the deed is <em>primé facie </em>evidence of the value of the land, as agreed on between the parties, and of the consideration paid; but the vendee is not concluded by. the consideration mentioned in the deed, and may go into parol evidence to show what it really was. And when it is <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>ascertained, it is sometimes called the value of the land, by which is always meant, the value at time of contract — for so it was agreed between the parties — but that consideration, or that 'value (whichever expression is preferred), is the measure, instead of the value at the time of the breach. On covenants for <em>quiet enjoyment, and of warranty, </em>the measure of damages is limited by the consideration-money and interest, and this is said by Mr. Rawle, in his excellent work on <em>Covenants for Title, </em>p. 268, to be settled law in the states of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North and South- Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, Ohio, Arkansas, and Iowa. In New Hampshire and Indiana, the question is said to be unsettled. In several other states, it seems not to have been touched. In Connecticut, Vermont, and Maine, the rule is to ascertain damages by the value of the land at the time of the eviction; though in Horsford <em>v. </em>Wright, <em>Kirby R. </em>3, the leading case in Connecticut, Law, C. J., admitted the British rule to be the consideration of the deed. In Massachusetts, there are authorities both, ways, though the weight of them inclines to the rule as held in Connecticut.

Though this does not appear, yet let it be granted — what then ? Do parol contracts for land rest on higher principles than written ? According to the hypothesis, they do, and that is enough to condemn it. Let me illustrate. A. and B. buy each a tract of land the same day — the one in consideration of certain services of uncertain value already rendered, the other in consideration of similar services to be rendered. A. takes a deed, with nominal consideration, but with a covenant of warranty, and goes into possession, and makes valuable improvements. B. leaves his contract in parol, gets no possession, and makes no improvements. Ten years elapse, and the discovery of minerals on both tracts, and the improvement of the country, have greatly enhanced the value of both tracts; when A. has his land taken away by a paramount title, and B. fails to get his title: both sue for damages — A. for a breach of his covenant, B. for breach of the parol agreement. We have seen that the measure of damages in A.’s case, is not the value of the land at the time of eviction, <em>but the consideration paid, </em>which may be ascertained, not merely from the deed, but from evidence <em>dehors </em>the deed; “ the uncertain value of the certain services” rendered, is the fact to be ascertained by a jury, and <em>that </em>value, with interest from the time of eviction, is the measure of his damages. <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>But not so in B.’s case, according to Judge Rogers. Here the jury are to ascertain the <em>value of the land at the time the contract was </em>broken, and to give damages to its full amount. Why ? “Because the land was the stipulated reward of the services.” But was not the land conveyed to A. as the <em>stipulated reward of the same services ? </em>Exactly. And yet, according to the principle avouched by Judge Rogers, A.’s folly in taldng the title-deed is punished by his recovering, perhaps, one-tenth of the sum awarded to B., though the services rendered by A. were of equal value with B.’s, and his land lost possibly the most valuable, by reason of his improvements added.</p>

If the court should yield to such claims, it is impossible to foresee where the mischief will end, from the ease with which such testimony can be procured, tempted as they will be by the chances of receiving large estates on proof of such agreements. If a parol contract for the conveyance of land has been violated, the party has his remedy for action, when he will recover the damages <em>actually </em>sustained.” Thus it is shown, that every judgment and judicial sentiment on record, prior to 1848, is in fatal antagonism to the ruling in Jack <em>v. </em>McKee.</p>

So is King <em>v. </em>Brown. There, Chief Justice Nelson ruled, that these contracts are void under the statute, and then added: “ The true principle is this, the contract being void and incapable of enforcement in a court of law, the party paying the money, or rendering the service, in pursuance thereof may treat it as a nullity, and <em>recover the money, or value of the services rendered, under the. common </em>counts.”. Accordingly, the judge below, who had ruled that the <em>“plaintiff was entitled to recover the value of the lands, at the time the defendant should have conveyed," </em>was reversed.- - Judge Rogers says that King <em>v. </em>Brown, so far from overruling Burlingame <em>v. </em>Burlingame, in this particular, affirms the principle as to the measure of damages, which is most true; for the two cases are coincident on <em>this </em>point, and both of them dead against the doctrine for which Judge Rogers cited them. If I have not quoted enough from them to prove this, let any man study them for himself, and he will see I am right. There is a striking instance of the infectious nature of error, as well as of the <em>diligence </em>of a compiler, in Sedgwick’s work on the Measure of Damages, where the author, a New York lawyer, instead of examining, these cases in his own state, and giving us the rule they furnish, follows Judge Rogers in grouping them with Jack <em>v. </em>McKee, and-represents them as teaching the same doctrine.

Under the influence of such just sentiments, as this learned judge had advanced in Haines <em>v. </em>O’Conner, the courts were returning to a strict construction of the Statute of Fraud and Perjuries; and specific execution of parol contracts for lands was beginning to be denied, in every case, where it would not be a fraud to withhold execution, and the owners of land in Pennsylvania seemed likely to regain the protection which that statute was designed to afford their titles; but, as soon as the doctrine in Jack <em>v. </em>McKee came to be understood, it was perceived how, under cover of compensation, this venerable rule of property could be evaded.

Persons were not slow in conforming their demands to this imaginary distinction — a distinction, according to Smith’s note, without a difference — and accordingly, we have had, in rapid succession, a series of extraordinary cases, which may <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>fairly be regarded as fruits'of Jack <em>v. </em>McKee, and wbicb, as they are not yet reported, I proceed now to notice.</p>

It was an action against the personal representative of a decedent, and the proof of contract consisted in casual declarations of the decedent, made to tarious persons; sometimes importing that he meant to give the plaintiff, for services rendered, a house and lot known as the- “Wyand property,” and sometimes ten or twelve acres of land known as the “ Troutman property.” The plaintiff declared for both, and seems to have got a verdict for the value of both._ The evidence, less satisfactory to my mind than that which was repudiated in Bash <em>v. </em>Bash, was deemed <em>“ </em>direct and positive” by -three members of this bench, and the judgment was accordingly affirmed. In the opinion delivered by Chief Justice Black, no additional authorities are cited, and no new views advanced in support of the ruling in Jack <em>v. </em>McKee ; but there is a solemn and impressive exposition of the maxim of <em>stare decisis, </em>which it is much to be regretted was not before the mind of the court in 1848, for it might have prevented the decision that was made in Jack <em>v. </em>McKee. That case, as I have shown, was an abrupt departure from all that had gone before it, and deserved the chastisement which, while following it, the chief justice administered in McDowell <em>v. </em>Oyer, to all such departures. For myself, I take occasion to say, that when, through accident, press of business, or misconception, a decision is pronounced which ^subverts a fundamental rule of property, and by consequence renders every man’s estate insecure— which, under colour of compensating personal services, strips families of their patrimonial acres — which, in short, subjects land-titles to the changes and chances of parol evidence — the maxim of <em>stare decisis </em>bids us to go back to the old, straight, safe paths, and not to blunder again and again, because we have blundered once.</p>

The case was arbitrated, and on examining the principal witness for the plaintiff, his counsel conceived that he could strike higher, and accordingly discontinued that suit, and instituted another for the value of the old man’s homestead and one hundred acres of land, valued at about $10,000. On the trial of this cause, the evidence consisted of the usual declarations, importing testamentary intentions in favour of the grandson, and the rule in Jack <em>v. </em>McKee, <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>endorsed by McDowell <em>v. </em>Oyer, being, as I have occasion to know, most reluctantly applied under the pressure of authority, by the learned president of the Common Pleas, the plaintiff had a verdict for $9695. Embarrassment certainly, and possibly ruin to the grandfather’s estate — disappointment and poverty to widowed daughters and their children, and confusion and distress throughout the family of Nathan Beach — are the consequences. Painful as they are, I agree that these circumstances are no reason for changing a well-considered and long-settled rule of law; but they plead powerfully against this modern and destructive innovation upon well-considered and long-settled rules. Who does not see, that exact justice would have been done to young Beach, by giving him the amount of his claim, lessened by his grandfather’s advances ? He would, doubtless, never have thought of more, if Jack <em>v. </em>McKee had not put mischief into his head; and thus it is, that a bad precedent makes hard cases, as hard cases often make bad precedents.</p>

An old maiden lady, Becky Malaun, having real and personal estate, took a young girl to bring up, who was friendless and destitute. She clothed and schooled her — gave her, from time to time, various articles of personal property — suffered her to marry, after which she and her husband lived in the old lady’s house — the wife having control of the old lady’s purse, and, during the last year of her life, receiving various sums of money. After Becky’s death, Mrs. Ammon claimed $300 of the personal property as her own, which was set off to her, and then she instituted this action to recover the value of all that remained, both real and personal, on the strength of certain declarations which the old lady had been heard to make; and under the direction of the court, the jury gave the value of the property, $1843.47. Looking into the evidence, it seems to have been of about the usual stamp — expressions of affection and confidence, and indicative of testamentary intentions. The witnesses were a brother of the plaintiff, who obtained his most important revelations from this old woman, over seventy years of age, “ in the evening, at supper, while we were sitting at the table, taking tea,” and neighbours, who heard casual observations, from time to time, as opportunity served. Some attempt was made to establish a nuncupative will for the old lady; but that failing, on account of the rigour of our Statute of Wills, this action was resorted to with complete success. Garrulity is one of the privileges of old age, especially over the tea-table ; but if this modern rule of law prevails, it must be denied to old people, and they must be taught that <em>chit-chat </em>has become title in Pennsylvania; though even then, if they seal their lips hermetically, they must not be sure words will not be imputed to them which will transfer all they leave to stranger-hands.

That, according to my view's of right and-wrong, would be justice; and according to all that was written before Jack <em>v. </em>McKee, it would be law too. But to compensate -her, without reference to the value of her services, and according to the value of the property promised — not as its value was- when the promise was made, but when it was broken — is, in my humble opinion, opposed to law, reason and justice.</p>

Who does not know how easy it is to fabricate cases against dead men ? They are not here to explain,- to contradict, and to hold willing witnesses to their responsibility to the criminal law; and hence, persons are never wanting, to swear strongly in behalf of a living relative or friend. The prominent thought, expressed in some loose and casual conversation, may be substantially stated, though generally with high colouring ; but all the conditions and qualifications which the speaker annexed to the thought, are sure to be forgotten by the witness. These inaccuracies, resulting necessarily out of the infirmities of memory, and the bias and corruptibility of witnesses, and inherent, more or less, in all parol testimony, are what render it unfit to be evidence of title or interest in land. Hence society has provided itself with legislative guards, against the manifold dangers of parol proof in reference to lands, in the Statutes of Frauds, and of Wills. The first requires contracts about land, if more is meant than a three years’ lease, to be in writing; the other, that all wills shall be written, signed, and attested by two witnesses; and although it .provides, very cautiously, for noncupative wills in respect to <em>personalty, </em>it tolerates nothing in resp'ect to <em>realty, </em>except written and attested instruments. The legislature has provided for proof and specific execution of parol contracts of decedents, for land, <em>where the parties have so far in part executed them, as to tahe them out of the Statute of Frauds and: Perjuries </em>— a plain intimation that where they have not been in part executed, there is no remedy for them, either specific or substantial. Now, neither in Jack <em>v. </em>McKee, nor in the cases which have followed in its wake, was there any pretence of such part execution of the contracts alleged, as would take them out of the statute; and therefore, it has happened, that in giving damages to the full value of the contracts, and thus executing them substantially, not only all precedent judicial opinion has been contravened, but the legislative policy of the state has been violated. In each of these cases, the con-" tract has been such as the law would not allow to be enforced— which equity, even, would not rescue from the condemnation of <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>the statutes alluded to ; and yet we are told, the law will punish the breach of it, where there has been no fraud, with a measure of damages equivalent to specific performance!</p>

If the contract set up to take away another’s inheritance will not bear to be written, that is, if the party could not be brought to the point of signature, as in the case under review, the decedent most certainly could never have been brought; then, that is proof positive, that such a contract was never finally settled and made; and no amount of loose and incidental talk, or looser recollections and representations of it, ought to prevail against the powerful presumption that arises from the absence of written evidence.</p>
    <p id="b438-7" data-blocks='[["BL_438.5",438,[318,955,1158,301]]]'>But the great argument in these cases has been, that nothing could make the plaintiffs whole but the value of the land; that the value of the land is the value of the services, as fixed by the parties themselves, and that such parties, like all others, are to be held to their contracts.

To such a contract the parties are not to be holden, any more than to promises barred by the Statute of Limitations, or to contracts made in violation of the statutes against Sabbath breaking, usury, or indictable crimes and misdemeanors. Such a contract is just as much within the reason of the statute, when its fruits are sought in an action of <em>assumpsit, </em>as in an action of ejectment. The operation of the statute cannot, logically or fairly, be made to depend on the nature of the action brought on the contract. The statute is a rule of evidence, intended to prevent perjuries, to which contracts for land are supposed to offer peculiar temptations, and if fairly dealt by, must be so construed as to suppress that mischief. The mischief sprung from parol proof of land contracts, and whatever the form of action, the policy of the statute was, to exclude this medium of proof, “for the prevention of perjuries.” Now, it would require nice casuistry, to determine how much less temptation to fraud and perjury the <em>value </em>of a tract of land would offer, than the <em>tract </em>itself. It is the value of land, that constitutes the motive to contracts, actions, and perjuries about it; strip land of' all value, and it will not be the subject of contracts. And land and its value are equivalents; every acre in Pennsylvania has its equivalent in some denominate sum of money. Judge Rogers conjectured that Miss McKee would prefer Jack’s land to its value in moneys numbered, because “ it had been the home of her fathers;” but most people are not so sentimental as Miss <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>McKee, and would quite as soon have land’s worth in cash, as the land itself. The argument concedes, that the contract is within the statute, when you go for the land, but denies that it is, when you go for the value' of the land; that is, the statute, according to the argument, was made for “prevention of perjuries” in <em>ejectment, </em>but not in actions <em>on the case, </em>though the contract sued on and to be proved in both actions is' identically the same. Such a distinction would seem like trifling with rules of property and legal principles, if judicial sanction, again and again, had not given it the dignity and force of law.</p>

The law is under no obligation to make such parties whole, no more than it is to make a usurer whole: for their contracts, like his, are contraband ; but, in its clemency, the law does indemnify both. It allows a man, on a usurious contract-, to recover his actual dues, and it gives parties to parol contracts for land, compensation for their moneys paid, or their services rendered. This is indemnity] this makes them whole. Would not Ann McKee and Mrs. Ammon have been made whole by a reasonable allowance for such services, as their deceased benefactors had not already compensated ? If it be said, that nothing but the value of the land promised could compensate their services, and those of the plaintiff in McDowell <em>v. </em>Oyer, will it not he admitted, that in Beach’s case, he would have been made whole by a measure of damages, that should have been limited to the <em>amount of his own attested account rendered against his grandfather s estate ? </em>Was it, indeed, necessary, that he should have a Verdict for some seven or eight thousand dollars more than he claimed to be due him, in order that Judge Rogers’s principle in Rohr <em>v. </em>Kindt should be vindicated ? That <em>principle </em>has cost the heirs of old Nathan Beach dearly. After the affirmance of the judgment, they offered the plaintiff the land for the value of which he had sued; but he declined to take it, in satisfaction of his judgment, and I understand, it is expected to sell, at public sale, not only that land, but as much more, to raise the means for making him <em>whole, </em>according to this modern rule. P state this fact on unquestionable authority, and for the purpose - merely of illustrating the practical working of a legal principle, the soundness of which is extensively doubted, and which, though abundantly sanctioned by recent judicial authorities, is not according to the course of the common law, nor, as I humbly conceive, conducive to the safety and welfare of society. I insist that, in all of these cases, the actions should have been treated as in disaffirmance of the respective contracts, and indemnity is all that can legitimately come out of such actions; but if the action be not in disaffirmance, but <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>for breach of the contract, the rule of damages cited from <em>Sugden </em>applies, which is decisive against damages, according to the value of the bargain. The moment you go for the profits of the contract, for the land or its equivalent in money, you aflirm the contract, and' demand its virtual performance, and that brings it within the Statute of Frauds.</p>
