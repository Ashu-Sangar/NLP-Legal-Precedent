J.) delivered the following charge to the jury: “ It might be plausibly argued in this ease, that notice was not necessary, because by the death of the endorser, and by the assignment of the maker, it so happened that the representation of both these persons devolved into the same hands. But be that as it may, the notice given was sufficient under the circumstances. The endorser died on the 7th of March, and notice of protest was addressed to him at the post-office nearest his abode, on the day of default, to wit, on the 26th March. It does not appear that the holder or notary knew or had notice of his death ; nor, for that matter, does it even appear that the executors of the deceased endorser had done anything more than to prove the will and take out letters testamentary, which they did 21st March. It does not appear that they had given the necessary notice of their appointment, &amp;c., which is required by the statute. If they had given that notice, in our view it would not affect the case. Such a constructive notice would not reach the holder any more than do the proving of the will and the taking out letters.</p>

      <em>“ </em>If a party knew that an endorser was dead, or had such information of the fact as would put a man of common prudence upon inquiry, it would not do to address notice of protest to the dead man.

The law is laid down in the same way in the tenth edition of <em>Chitty on Bills, </em>p. 335, with the exception that there is a reference to Caunt <em>v. </em>Thompson, 7 <em>Com. Bench </em>400 (62 E. C. L. R.), where it was held, that presentment of a bill for payment, at the house of the acceptor, who was dead, to the drawer, who was the executor of the decedent, was sufficient notice of dishonour to the drawer; upon the rule, as expressed by Baron Alderson, that “ knowledge of the dishonour, obtained from a communication by the holder of the bill, amounts to notice.”</p>

In Steward <em>v. </em>Eden, <a href="/cai/2/0121-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Cai. Cas. 121" data-case-ids="6691704" data-case-paths="/cai/2/0121-01">2 <em>Caines Rep. </em>121</a>, notice of the dishonour, in the usual form, was carried to the dwelling-house of the endorser on the 9th November 1798 ; the house was found fastened up, and on this, the bearer of the notice rolled it up, and put it into the keyhole of the outer door; the endorser, shortly after the making of the note, retired to his country seat, four miles from the city of New York, where he died on the 13th September 1798; and the will, under which the defendants acted, was not proved until the 19th day of December 1798, before which period the plaintiffs knew not of any will or who were executors. It wTas held by the court, that the notice was left at the right place; and Livingston, Justice, said: “ Nor was it fatal to direct the notice to the endorser himself, for as it was not known whether he had made a will, nor who his executors were, until long after, it was full as probable that it would reach the parties interested by this address as by any other; some one of the deceased’s family would either open it or see it safely delivered to an executor. The notice, therefore, was well served, and its address proper.” This doctrine is reaffirmed by Chief Justice Spencer in The Merchants’ Bank <em>v. </em>Birch, 17 <em>Johnson’s Rep. </em>28, in its fullest extent, and again by Chief Justice Nelson, in Willis <em>v. </em>Green, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Hill%20234" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Hill 234">5 <em>Hill </em>234</a>.

In the first of these cases, it was not known to the holders, that the endorser had made a will; in the second, it was not even known to them, that he was dead.” In Beal <em>v. </em>Peck, 12 <em>Barbour S. C. Rep. </em>245, a notice of protest, directed to the deceased endorser, taken from the post-office by the direction of a subsequent endorser, and delivered to the administrators of the intestate, was held sufficient. In Barnes’s Executors <em>v. </em>Reynolds, 4 <em>Howard Miss. Rep. </em>114, it was held by Chief Justice Sharkey, that the court below was strictly correct in charging the jury that, if the holder knew of the death of the endorser, and could, by ordinary diligence, have ascertained who were executors, then it was incumbent on him to give notice to them; but if the holder did not know of his death, or, by ordinary diligence, could not have ascertained who were executors, then notice directed to the testator was sufficient.</p>
