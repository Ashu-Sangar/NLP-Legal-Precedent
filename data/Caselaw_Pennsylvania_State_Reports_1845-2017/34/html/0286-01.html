It is not a fact that the husband was ever seised of the land, in the proper sense of seisin : 5 <em>Casey </em>76. The deed was not in fact delivered to him, nor was he ever entitled to it. It was delivered in fact two years after his death, after Junk had paid the balance due on it, and in his presence, and really only for his benefit. It is then only by a fiction, that the delivery can be treated as made to the husband of the plaintiff. But the fictions of the law are always in aid of justice, and never of injustice. If. the delivery of the deed had been in fact for the benefit of the husband’s estate, we might help out the intention by a fiction; but it was, and ought to have been, for the benefit of Junk, and the law invents or adopts no fiction to change or defeat an intention so honest: 4 <em>Kent </em>(8th ed.) 505.</p>
