D. 1843. That notice of said loss was given by public advertisement in the North American and Public Ledger, two daily newspapers published in the city of Philadelphia, and that sufficient notice of said loss was also specially given by the plaintiff to defendants. That subsequently to said notice, the defendants bought the said certificate from Shultz &amp; Dock, brokers of the city of Philadelphia, for a full and valuable consideration. That the purchase so made by defendants was made by them as brokers for Richard Willing — the amount paid charged to him and paid by him — that within a short time after the said purchase, the defendants, acting on behalf of the said Richard Willing, delivered the said certificate to the State treasurer, in payment of bank stock sold by the commissioners of the commonwealth to the said Richard Willing, under the provisions of the act of assembly, of April 6th, 1843, entitled “an act to provide for the payment of the domestic creditors of this commonwealth, sale of state stocks, and for other purposes.” That the said defendants received from the said Richard Willing, a brokerage of <em>\ </em>of one per cent. That Shultz &amp; Dock, from whom the defendants bought the said certificate, had themselves received the same for a valuable consideration in the usual course of business, in good faith, without knowledge or notice of the loss thereof by the plaintiff.

It is not easy to determine what would be <em>such; </em>but the bare fact of loss would not be evidence of it. No man is bound to watch his property more anxiously than a man of common prudence does; and he is bound to use no more diligence in keeping it than is compatible with reasonable convenience. Any other measure would enable the possessor of a horse stolen from a common, or a meadow, to make title to it; which, as every one knows, is not the law. The reason is that it would be intolerably oppressive to compel an owner to keep his chattels under lock and key. When the rule of general convenience occasions a loss, that must fall on one of two innocent men, which of them is to bear it ? Certainly not he who had the legal title from the first, and who has done no act to divest it for the benefit of another not more innocent or deserving. <em>Prior in tempore, potior in jure. </em>The law leaves the parties and the title where it found them. What is the carelessness that is imputed to the loser in this instance ? It is said that as the paper was negotiable, by an act of the legislature, he ought to have filled up the blank endorsement by making the contents payable to his own order, in anticipation of what actually happened. The rule attempted to bo applied would equally compel a man to lock his stable door; for, the owner of the paper had no more reason to think that he was going to lose it, than a man has to think his horse is going to be stolen. He was not bound therefore to take any measure of special precaution in respect to it.— Besides, it might not have suited his convenience to incur the responsibility of an endorser, by putting his name on the paper; and he was not bound to do it. The case is therefore with the defendant in error.</p>
