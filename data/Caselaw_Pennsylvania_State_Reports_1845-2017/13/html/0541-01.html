The defendant denied that he ever executed a note to Haines, of the date aforesaid; alleged that he was discharged under the bankrupt law on the 30th of September, 1842, and that previous to his discharge as aforesaid, he had given to the plaintiff’s testator a note for' $600, and that the one now in suit, was the same, with the date altered so- as to bring the date <em>after </em>the time of his discharge.</p>

The hand writing of the defendant has been established in the usual way, and no witness has stated his belief that the signature is not genuine, or has pointed out any part of the note in which he thinks an alteration has been made; nor can the court perceive, upon the face of the note, any evidences of alteration. But the defence chiefly relied upon consists of declarations alleged to have been made by Frederick Haines, in his life time, after the 12th December, 1843, as stated by William Morton and Nicholas Peck, in their testimony. These declarations are inconsistent with the fact that Mr. Haines had, at that time, the possession of the note in question. In deciding upon the effect of these declarations, the court and jury are bound by the law, as decided by the Supreme Court, in the opinion in this cause, as read to the jury by both defendant’s counsel. The case is therefore referred to the jury under the rule there laid down. If the note be genuine the plaintiffs are entitled to recover. If it be not genuine, or, which is the same thing, if its date be altered in the manner alleged, as stated already, the plaintiffs cannot recover.</p>

The time of this declaration, as well as the subject matter of it, were for the jury, under the care and direction of the court. The evidence was admissible in accordance with the ruling of this court in many cases.</p>
    <p id="b545-7" data-blocks='[["BL_545.9",545,[199,759,1171,344]]]'>In Kingston <em>vs. </em>Wharton, 2 <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>208, it was held that where a debtor, previous to his bankruptcy, promises a particular creditor to pay the debt, when he shall be able, his certificate of a discharge under the act of 1800, is no bar to an action on the new promise, although the original debt might have been proved under the commission; nor need the new promise be made to an agent of the creditor, to give a good cause of action; McKinley <em>vs. </em>Okeson, 5 <em>Barr </em>369.</p>

We think that the evidence was properly admitted.</p>

Upon a careful examination of the evidence and the charge, we see no error. The jury were' instructed that the defendant’s signature to the note was proved in the usual way. The defence and allegation of the defendant was, that the note in suit, which bore date subsequent to the discharge and,certificate under the bankrupt law, had been altered in its date, from a period prior to the discharge, for the purpose of avoiding the effect of the bankruptcy. The face of the note exhibited no evidence Of the alteration to sustain this allegation. The defence rested solely on the alleged declarations of Haines, as proved by Morton and Peck, that he held a note for $600, dated prior to the proceedings and discharge in bankruptcy, and there was no way to recover it, unless he got a new note from Stouffer. The case of Haines <em>vs. </em>Stauffer, in 10 <em>Barr </em>363, is not inconsistent with the ruling of this case. There, the court submitted as a fact to the jury, the ingenious suggestion of the defendant’s counsel, of which there was no evidence. The determination of this court was, that where a state of facts could not be inferred on a demurrer to evidence, it was error to submit their determination to a jury. I think the case was fairly put to the jury, under the evidence, and in accordance with the principles settled by the Supreme Court ; and the jury were instructed, if they found the note in suit given by the defendant as it purported, the plaintiff was entitled to a verdict. If it was not given as it purported, or its date altered, the plaintiff ought not to recover. <a id="p544" href="#p544" data-label="544" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*544</a>A court has no right to submit a point assumed by counsel without some evidence from which it might be fairly inferred.</p>

    <p id="b546-7" data-blocks='[["BL_546.5",546,[307,710,1170,512]]]'>The Common Pleas has a right to make rules, regulating a request for instructions on points. Many cases have been reversed, in this court, on points put and answered by the court, near to, or at the close of a charge, artfully put by ingenious and able counsel, which had not • been considered by counsel on the trial, or carefully considered by the judge. This is a practice of professional skill with which I have been long familiar. The courts owe it to themselves, as well as to suitors, fo make .such rules as will prevent surprise, and enable them to answer upon reflection, and without a waste of the public time. Here the rule of court had not been complied with, and the defendant’s counsel were not entitled to an answer.</p>
