      <em>retorno habendo </em>was entered, and the sheriff returned the <em>fi. fa. </em>“eloigned as to the goods and chattels.” This action was then brought by Fitter <em>vs. </em>Roberts, on the replevin bond, and the material plea was set off. Under the notice, the defendant offered to prove the payment and advance of various sums of money by himself to the partnership composed of Carr, to whose use this action is brought, and Roberts, the defendant. The rejection of the evidence was the point argued here.</p>
