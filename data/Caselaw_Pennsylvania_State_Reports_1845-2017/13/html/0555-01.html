The power of making and repairing roads and removing nuisances is granted by law to supervisors of highways under the direction of the courts, and they are bound to do it; yet this does not prevent the legislature from authorizing turnpikes, and the erection of gates on these roads.— Neither does the obligation of cities to open and repair streets interpose any barrier against the right of the sovereign power to regulate its highways; and streets in a town or city are nothing more.</p>

The constant passage of drays, wagons, carts and other vehicles, from one part of a city to another, in pursuit of the business, trade, agriculture and commerce of the country, requires that the streets should be open. In many places the stoppage to pay tolls would block up and stop the streets, and as the toll gatherer would have to seek shelter from the vicissitudes of the weather, a barrier would at times be interposed with no person at hand to open it. In the case under consideration, although the gate is at the verge of the continuous line of houses, yet if the company can erect' it there, they may erect a gate as .far up the city as King street. -It was well known to the legislature that the city of Lancaster, in the garden of the State, would, in process of time, become a mart for manufactures and commercial and agricultural products, and extend to its utmost limits. Where then was the necessity or propriety of granting, to a turnpike company, the privilege of obstructing the streets and hindering the business of the city, when full power was granted to the municipal corporation'to keep those streets open and in good repair, and which it was compellable to do, at the instance of any person.

We have no doubt whatever that the legislature may alter, modify or repeal the charter of a city, making compensation for private rights, which might thereby be invaded or destroyed. But when they intend to do so, it is but fair to the municipality' and to the public to presume that they will say they intend to revoke privileges already granted, and alter a solemn deed already made.</p>
