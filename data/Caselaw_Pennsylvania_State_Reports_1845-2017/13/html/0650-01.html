Jacob Hershey died.in December, 1829, intestate, leaving Elizabeth, the plaintiff, his only child, who was then about three years old, and the defendant, with another 'Martin Nissley of Conewago, became his administrators. Among other lands owned by Jacob Hershey, were two tracts containing together about fifty acres, which it was proved he purchased, from James Jackson, by articles of agreement, dated 11th February, 1822, and for which the purchase money was paid.— Jacob Hershey took possession of this land, and, held it till his death. A deed from Jackson to him, for this land, was <a id="p651" href="#p651" data-label="651" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*651</a>found among the papers of Martin Nissley of Conewago, after his death. The defendant, with his co-administrator, ■ after the death of Jacob Hershey, took possession of this land, and leased it for years ending 1st April, 1831, .and 1st April, 1832. There was a judgment in favor of Jacob Hershey, against James Jackson, in Dauphin Common Pleas, entered July 17th, 1819, and revived in 1831. On this judgment the defendant, and Martin Nissley of Conewago, as administrators of Jacob Hershey, deceased, caused executions to be issued, under which this land was levied and sold by the sheriff of Dauphin county on' 14th of January, 1832, to Benjamin Young, for $500. It was proved that the defendant was present at the sheriff’s sale, and requested the purchaser to bid for the property. After this sale the purchaser took possession of the land, and holds it to this time; The purchase money paid by Young was paid over by'the sheriff to Mr. Elder, attorney for the administrators, less the costs, amounting to $439 70, which Mr. Elder paid over to Martin Nissley of Conewago. The administrators of Jacob Hershey settled an administration account, which was confirmed 16th May, 1837, showing a balance in their hands of $6,475 51; and a supplemental and final account, which was confirmed 12th February, 1839, showing a balance in their hands of $1,488 41; but the purchase money of the Jackson land was not included or accounted for in either of these accounts. These balances were paid over to the widow of Jacob Hershey, and the guardian of Elizabeth, the daughter, who was appointed about the time of the settlement of the first account.

The judge directed that if the administrators acted in concert and with knowledge of the circumstances, the defendant, as the survivor of them, is answerable in'.this action for a tort; a position not to be disputed. Hershey, the .plaintiff’s father, bought Jackson’s land in consideration that he would pay Jackson’s debts, for which it had been conveyed to trustees; and when that should be done, Hershey was to have a conveyance of the title from them. Having .got in the debts, he became, by the terms of the articles, the equitable owner. .If any remained outstanding, of which there was no proof, it was the • duty of the administrators tp pay them, and put the plaintiff in a position ■ to demand specific execution of the contract; instead of which they sold the land to a purchaser without notice on a judgment of. 'Hershey against Jackson,- which was paramount to' the legal title of the trustees; and thus effectually rescinded it. . In thus selling her land for a debt due to herself, they not only made a monstrous mistake, but acted with culpable precipitation in taking their own advice; -for though they employed counsel, it was' not to consult him, but to prescribe his path. For this,-they became answerable, not by citation, but by action; for we determined in Reed’s Appeal, not reported but accurately 'quoted by Justice Huston, in his dissenting opinion in the case of Torr’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Rawle%20256" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Rawle 256">2 <em>Rawle </em>256</a>, that the Orphans’ Court has not jurisdiction of a'devastavit in the settlement of an administration account; much less has it jurisdiction of ‘an injury to the real estate of the heir.

The plaintiff is entitled to nothing for the loss of the bargain or for improvement's; and the’ parties are consequently in <em>statu quo </em>when' the purchase money is returned. But here, the value has not been fixed by any agreement between the plaintiff and the administrators who are not parties to the .agreement with Jackson, and who cannot say that the value was not subsequently enhanced.

Had she been bound to surcharge' or loose the whole, she would have had no election; and a sacrifice of her property might have been legitimated by compelling her to take the price of it in satisfaction. She was not bound to receive it. On the contrary, electing to pursue the' administrators- for the tort, it was her cue to resist every attempt to charge them; and whether successfully or not, the event could' not deprive her of her election. Nothing could do so but a voluntary acceptance of the purchase money with knowledge of the circumstances. Had it been charged, she might perhaps have been required to show that she had not assented to it; but as it was not, there was no presumption of acquiéscence.
