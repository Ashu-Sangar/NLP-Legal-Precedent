    <p class="summary" id="b221-9" data-blocks='[["BL_221.7",221,[214,1257,1181,567]]]'>The expression <em>“held in trust,” </em>to say nothing of the broad term <em>“on </em>consignment,” seems to me to comprehend and protect the plaintiff’s goods. The defendants are commission merchants and <em>forwarding agents, </em>and kept the warehouse which was burnt down, for receiving goods, to be forwarded as directed. They received the plaintiff’s goods and <em>held </em>them <em>on deposit, </em>subject to his order. They had received, under the name of a <em>loading </em>commission, a certain sum, and were entitled to charge upon the implied usage in the business, an equal amount, which they denominated a <em>receiving </em>commission, and which I presume to be properly for storage. The commissions actually paid appear to have been for services not yet rendered. But this consideration can have no effect upon the rights of the parties.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b221-10" data-blocks='[["BL_221.8",221,[209,1823,1180,567]]]'>The definition of <em>bailment, </em>according to all the authorities of reputation, describes accurately the arrangement which subsisted between the plaintiff and defendants, as to the goods of the former. “Bailment, properly so called,” says Sir William Jones, “is a delivery of goods <em>in trust </em>on a contract, express or implied, that the trust shall be duly executed, and the goods re-delivered as soon as the time or use for' which they were bailed, shall have elapsed or be performed.” Judge Story, for a reason which he suggests, and which is obviously well founded, makes a slight change in this definition. He describes bailment to be “ a delivery of a thing <em>in trust </em>for some <em>special </em>object or purpose, and upon a contract express or implied, to conform to the object or purpose of the <em>trust.” Storg on Bailments, </em>2.</p>

There is no doubt, therefore, that the language of the policy is broad enough to comprehend the goods of the plaintiff. That a trustee may insure, and after the happening of a loss within the policy, recover the amount for the benefit of the party really interested, has long since ceased to be an open question. Policies similar to the-present, in which the insurance is expressly declared to be not merely of the property of the assured, in his own right, but of property held by him <em>in trust, </em>and on consignment or commission, and the like, are of every day’s occurrence. They are adapted to the varied wants of a large mercantile community, and the construction which gives to all the property fairly within the language used, <em>equal protection, </em>does but carry out the true meaning and actual purpose of the party in whose name the instrument was obtained. That it covers the whole value of all such property, as between him and the insurer, and not the mere interest of the former, has been decided in De Forest <em>vs. </em>Fulton, Fire Insurance Company, 1 <em>Hale Rep. </em>84, 118, 186. That such was the intention of the parties, it seems to me impossible to doubt. What other meaning could the parties have had? Why, having provided for their own property, and property held on consignment, was that <em>held in trust </em>mentioned? What else does it mean in this connection, but property, the custody and possession of which were in themselves, but the actual ownership in others ? The defendants’ business sufficiently indicates this. They are stated to be forwarding agents. Their business would therefore frequently place the property of others in their warehouse. The two kinds of commission which they charged is a sufficient manifestation that they anticipated such a reception. At a small expense, much more than repaid by their augmented business, induced by the confidence which an insurance would inspire, they produced their policy. Its terms place all the goods within the warehouse, from time to time, on the same level, all are equally protected.</p>

Spealdng of insurance effected by <em>agents, </em>he says, “they may insure in their own names, or in the name and for the benefit of the principal. If they ensure in their own name <em>only, </em>they may, in case of loss, recover the whole amount of the value of the property insured, from the underwriters, and <em>the surplus beyond their own interest </em>will be a resulting trust for the benefit of their principals.” The references which are given do not so much as allude, in the slightest manner, to what is supposed to be the meaning of this passage, I do not, however, think it was intended to apply to a policy, expressing in plain terms, that it embraced alike the interests of the agent and his principal — property exclusively his own, and prop<a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>erty which belongs to others in fact, but which he held in trust for them. This, I apprehend, would not be called, by the author, property insured <em>in the agent’s </em>own name only. But if the meaning be as has been supposed by the counsel, I am not aware of any other authority for it, but that of the honored jurist himself, and, no reason being suggested by him in its support, and my own convictions, after a careful examination of the subject being different, 1 must adhere to them.</p>

The policy is on “ <em>merchandize generally, and without exception, their own, or held in trust, or on assignment, contained in the bach building and shed adjoining.” </em>In the specification “merchandize generally” includes books and stationary in packages.
