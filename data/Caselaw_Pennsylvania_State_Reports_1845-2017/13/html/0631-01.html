The word abortion is synonymous and equivalent to miscarriage in its primary meaning. It has a secondary meaning in which it is used to denote the offspring. But it was not used in that sense here, and ought not to have been. It is a flagrant crime at common law to attempt to procure the miscarriage or abortion of the woman. Because it interferes with and violates the mysteries of nature in that process by which' the human race is propogated and continued. It is a crime against nature which obstructs the fountain of life, and therefore it is punished. The next error assigned is, that it ought to have been charged in the count that the woman 'had become <em>quisle. </em>But, although it has been so held in Massachusetts and some other States, it is not, I apprehend, the law in Pennsylvania, and never ought to have been the law anywhere; ■ It is not the murder of a ljving child which constitutes the offence, but the destruction of gestation by wicked means and against nature. The moment the womb is instinct with embryo life, and gestation has begun, the crime may be perpetrated. The allegation in this indictment. was therefore sufficient, to wit: “ that she was then and there pregnant and big with child. By the well settled and established doctrine of the common law, the civil rights of an infant <em>in ventre sa mere </em>are fully protected at all periods after conception; 3 <em>Golee’s </em>Institutes. A count charging a wicked intent to procure miscarriage of a woman, “ then and there being pregnant” by administering potions, &amp;c., was held good on demurrer by the Supreme Court of this State; <em>Mss. Meps. </em>January, 1846; <em>Whart. Grim. Law, </em>308.
