    <p class="summary" id="b331-9" data-blocks='[["BL_331.7",331,[178,1031,1186,1300]]]'>The plaintiff employed the defendant to' purchase a lottery ticket for him in the city of Baltimore. The ticket was there purchased by the defendant for the plaintiff, and retained by him until the lottery was drawn, when he called with the lottery broker, and received the proceeds of a prize payable on the ticket, to the amount of two hundred and twelve dollars. The only evidence in the case, as to where the arrangement was made between the plaintiff and defendant, as to the purchase of the ticket, was that both plaintiff and defendant resided in Pennsylvania at the time, and that the defendant was on a visit to Baltimore when he made the purchase, from which it is fairly inferable that it was made in Pennsylvania. It is contended by the defendant that there can be no recovery against him, because, by the laws of Pennsylvania, lotteries are unlawful, and all transactions growing out of them are unlawful, and will not be enforced by our courts. A transaction or contract founded upon that which is either <em>malum in se </em>or <em>malum prohibitum </em>will not be enforced by our courts. But is this either ? It is admitted that lotteries are lawful in the state of Maryland; and there is no law of Pennsylvania which prohibits a citizen of Pennsylvania from purchasing a lottery ticket in Maryland. The case presented, then, is simply this: the plaintiff procured the defendant to purchase a ticket for him in Baltimore. He did so. That ticket drew a prize-which entitled the plaintiff to receive two hundred and tw$ve dollars. After the lottery was drawn, the defendant called and received the money for the plaintiff, and now refuses to pay it to him, because the transaction was unlawful. We think it was not unlawful; and if it was, the defendant cannot take advantage of it; and therefore instruct you, that if you believe the facts in evidence, the plaintiff is eniitled to recover.</p>
