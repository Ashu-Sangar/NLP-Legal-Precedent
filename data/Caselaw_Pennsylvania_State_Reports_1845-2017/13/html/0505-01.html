I had this power and this paper, (referring to the paper dated 23rd September, 1842,) showed him this power, and stated Mr. Flannery wished me to make this transfer and receive the balance of interest; (witness in repeating this said “ balance of money due,”) after making a deduction for a certain note in bank. Dechert said he was going to the city, and after he returned he would call on me and have the thing fixed. I was satisfied. I think I mentioned that Flannery had been up repeatedly and had left the power with me because he had not been able to see Mr. Dechert. My impression is, that Mr. Dechert was, at that time, President of the Bank. Mr. Dechert did not call on me on his return. I called several times at Dechert’s office afterwards, and did not find him in, to have this matter fixed. My impression is that I saw Dechert in Reading after that, and before this suit was brought.</p>

And if A should agree in writing to take and purchase all the crop of wheat raised byB on his farm, in the harvest of 1850, at one dollar per bushel, and deliver the writing to B, and B should thresh his crop and <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>tender it to <em>A, </em>would lie not be bound to take it or answer in damages; Flannery is in tbe same category, and wby should he not recover, having kept the stock till the time, and then tendered and offered a transfer. It was not a naked contract. Flannery was bound to keep the stock for Dechert just as B, the farmer, was bound to keep his wheat for A. And if Flannery had sold his stock for a higher price, or refused to transfer upon tender of the consideration, he would have been liable in damages. One promise is often the consideration of another promise; and a promise may be implied from acts and circumstances. And who can resist the implication that Flannery agreed to transfer the stock that Dechert agreed to take and purchase, upon payment of the consideration. The consideration of Dechert’s promise was a counter or equivalent promise or implied agreement to transfer. It was a case of mutual promises, and Flannery having tendered performance was entitled to this action for damages. It was not a naked or one-sided contract, to which nobody assented but one man. And that was the mistake of the court below.</p>
