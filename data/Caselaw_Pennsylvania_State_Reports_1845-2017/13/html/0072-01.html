      <em>Statement of Case. </em>— In 1848, the assessor of Doylestown borough returned to the commissioners that he had assessed the plaintiff in error at the sum of $50,000, to which the commissioners added $25,000, making an aggregate of $75,000. James having made a statement of his personal property, appealed from the assessment made, to the commissioners, according to the provisions of the act of 1884. The commissioners refused to entertain the appeal or to make any record of their proceedings in the matter. James thereupon presented his petition to the court for a mandamus to compel them to make a record of their proceedings, that he might appeal to the court according to the provisions of the act of 1836. The court refused the prayer of the petition.</p>
