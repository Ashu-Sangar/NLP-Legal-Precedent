      <em>St. Greorge T. </em>Campbell, for plaintiffs in error, contended:</p>
    <p id="b216-12" data-blocks='[["BL_216.11",216,[338,1680,1164,131]]]'>1. That this was admissible in mitigation of damages. The freight <em>was </em>a lien — the plaintiff below had no right to possession without its payment, and the payment was in her relief.</p>
    <p id="b216-13" data-blocks='[["BL_216.12",216,[338,1811,1169,348]]]'>2. That it cannot be likened to the case of Dallam <em>vs. </em>Fitler, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 323" data-case-ids="480162" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0323-01">6 W. <em>&amp; S. </em>323</a>. There payment of rent was decided not to be evidence in mitigation of damages, because there the act of the party in levying the execution, made the rent a lien under the act of assembly, and he could not avail himself of the consequences of his own wrong. Here,.the freight was a <em>lien </em>before the levy— not by the act of the party, and the payment or tender of it, was a condition precedent to obtaining possession.</p>

The case of Dallam <em>vs. </em>Fitler is conclusive on the question, for, to allow the sheriff to constitute himself the proper judge of the amount of freight which might be due — to decide without consulting the consignee, plaintiff below, that the freight had not been paid in advance — to <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>take upon himself to pay this claim, perhaps a second time — to determine that the consignor had not hound himself to pay the freight and been accepted for it without recourse to the consignee — in short, to allow the sheriff to seize and sell a party’s goods without color of right, (as the jury have settled this sale to have been,) and then to decide what appropriation of the proceeds ought to be deemed beneficial to that party, would be establishing a most dan* gerous tribunal.</p>

A sheriff who has legally levied an execution on property bound by a lien, has a right to discharge it, in order to <em>get </em>possession; for his writ gives him every implied power which may be necessary to the execution of it. But, as it gives him no authority to seize the property of a stranger, it gives him no power to disburthen it, express or implied. In this case it was not the duty of the sheriff to meddle with the plaintiff’s property, and it stands as if the levy, which was utterly void, made no part of it. We have, then, the naked case of voluntary payment of a debt out "of the proceeds of a debtor’s property wrongfully converted; but not at the debtor’s special instance and request. Every one has a right to adjust his own liabilities ; and no one has a right to make another his debtor, by intrusion into his affairs.</p>
