This was an action of trespass <em>quare clausum, fregit, </em>brought by James Kennedy against Samuel Philipy and the other defendants for pulling down the plaintiff’s fence. The defendants pleaded the general issue, and also a special justification. On the trial the <em>plaintiff </em>offered Matthew Gordon as a witness. He was objected to by the defendants as incompetent, because, as was alleged and admitted, he was engaged in taking down the fence with the defendants, and if any trespass was committed, he was guilty with the rest. He was, however, not a party to the suit.</p>

Otherwise the plaintiff might, by bringing separate suits, obtain full satisfaction for the whole of the injury against each of the trespassers. The witness was rejected.</p>

He may severally proceed to judgment against all, and have his election <em>de melioribus damnis, </em>unless he has actually received satisfaction from one; and in that case, it may, as in Duane <em>vs. </em>Micken, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Yeates%20437" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Yeates 437">4 <em>Yeates, </em>437</a>, be pleaded in bar of further prosecution. As satisfaction was not had in this case, the judgment could not be pleaded in bar of an action against the witness, who, consequently had no fixed interest in promoting a recovery. He had a contingent interest in the chance that the plaintiff would follow a recovery with execution, and procure payment by compulsion, which would certainly relieve him, but it was too remote and uncertain to affect his competency.</p>
