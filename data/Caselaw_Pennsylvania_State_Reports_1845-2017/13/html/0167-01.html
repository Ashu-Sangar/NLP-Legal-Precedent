The 13th section of the act, however, which provides for the manner of apportioning a claim jointly.against two or more buildings, <em>owned by the same person, </em>affords a strong inference that the legislature contemplated leaving the material man <em>to </em>his ordinary remedy, by <em>sepan’ate </em>liens, where the materials were purchased on the joint credit of buildings, <em>not owned by the same person. </em>And under the decision in Gorgas <em>vs. </em>Douglass, this is the only way, in such case, in which the lien, created by the act of 1836, can be enforced.^</p>

    <p id="b172-6" data-blocks='[["BL_172.4",172,[330,549,1174,739]]]'>The first section of that act provides “that every building erected within the several counties of this commonwealth to which the act entitled ‘ an act securing to mechanics and others payment for their labor and materials in erecting any house or other building within the city and county of Philadelphia,’ passed 17th March, 1806, and the several supplements thereto, now extends, shall be subject to a lien'for the payment of all debts contracted for work done, or materials furnished for or about the erection or construction of the same.” That the debt in question was a debt contracted for and about the building of the defendant is indisputably clear. It is equally clear that a joint lien could not be filed: 6 <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>512-13. It is enough if the lumber is furnished <em>for </em>the building: <em>2 S. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>171.

The spirit and object of the act is that each house should pay for its own lumber; and when the contractor is erecting two houses for different persons, unless the material man can divide his bill which is purchased by the contractor, and file a lien for a proper portion to such building, the first section of the act is defeated. The proceeding is <em>in rem, </em>and I am unable to discover any good reason why this should not be done. <em>“Every building," </em>by the act, “is <em>subject to a lien, for the payment of all debts contracted for work done, or materials furnisíied." </em>The only argument of weight against such a course is that the lien may be filed against one of <em>the </em>buildings for an improper proportion, but this can be adjusted by the jury on a trial on the <em>scire facias, </em>under the direction of the court.</p>

We think this lien was well filed, and the learned Court was in error in dismissing it from the record.</p>
