The evidence for the libellant established (it was urged) a case of desertion, as set out in the petition. The respondent produced evidence to negative that position, and <em>(inter </em>alia) the following bond of the libellant, which was excepted to by his counsel, but admitted by the court:</p>

This bond may be viewed as equivalent to an agreement to live separate and apart; or, if not considered in that light, the libellant is at least precluded by it from alledging that the desertion took place from the 6th of July, 1844. In the face of that bond before the libellant can alledge wilful and malicious desertion on his wife’s part, he ought to have communicated to her that his house was open to her, and that he was ready to supply her wants, and conduct himself towards her as a husband ought to do. If, after such notice, she still persisted, then would the desertion have become wilful and malicious, because without any good cause. You will therefore, find a verdict for the respondent.</p>

The supplement to the divorce act of the 26th February, 1817, <em>Dunlop </em>330, gives a divorce <em>a mensa et thoro </em>to the wife for cruel and barbarous treatment, and enables the court to allow her alimony until the husband is willing to cohabit with her, and perform his marital duties. On the complaint of the wife, the husband gave bond to the guardians of the poor to pay her four dollars a week for her support. This shows anything but desertion, on the part of the wife. She clings to her husband for support. His attempt is in disregard both of the laws of God and man, and to pervert the act of 1815 to a foul purpose, to get clear of his wife, when he keeps her from his habitation and his home; and this, he profanely swears, is “ wilful and malicious desertion,” on the part of his wife! The attempt is too gross for deliberate consideration.</p>
