Else, why assign the whole, if only the half was to be sold for payment of particular debts ; or why hold the trust subject to the order of the assignor till it should be convenient to make it a part of the road, and thus freed from levy and sale ? Evidently, to use the fraudulent ownership of the assignee as a cover to keep off execution creditors. It is strange that corporations should resort to contrivances so flimsy and transparent.</p>
