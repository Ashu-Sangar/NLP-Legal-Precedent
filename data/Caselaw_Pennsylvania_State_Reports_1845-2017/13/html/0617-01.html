    <p class="summary" id="b619-9" data-blocks='[["BL_619.7",619,[194,892,1171,219]]]'>This -was an action of debt brought by the Commonwealth against Christian F. Haehnlen and others, as sureties on the official bond of Jacob Sallade, late surveyor general of Pennsylvania. The claim of the Commonwealth was for certain fees received by Mr. Sallade as surveyor general, and not paid over to the state treasurer.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b619-10" data-blocks='[["BL_619.8",619,[187,1110,1178,518]]]'>The defence was that Mr. Sallade from time to time paid certain contingent expenses of his office out of these fees, and that the auditor general had subsequently settled his accounts for these contingent expenses, and drawn' warrants in .favor of Sallade on the state treasurer, who paid .the same; when it was the duty of the auditor general and state treasurer to have retained these sums, or credited them on account of the fees then due from Mr. Sallade to the commonwealth. It was further alleged in defence, that the state treasurer ought to have deducted the sum due the commonwealth for fees from the salary of Mr. Sallade, which he neglected to do. The court below rejected the evidence of the defendant, and decided that this defence was not available.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b619-11" data-blocks='[["BL_619.9",619,[183,1622,1177,355]]]'>. On the trial, defendant offered to show the amount of contingent expenses drawn quarterly from the treasury; and that this sum was paid to the surveyor general by the accountant department, when the amount in arrear should have been retained from the sum so paid over. That the chief clerk in this department received the fees and paid out• the expenses aforesaid; and the surveyor general afterwards received this same money from the treasury.</p>

This evidence objected to as not an available defence. That no neglect of duty on the part of the officers can discharge the sureties in the bond. That the contingent expenses were not lawfully coming, to the sur-' veyor general.</p>

The 51st section of the act of assembly of 30th March, 1811, Purd. 977, makes it the duty of the “auditor general and state treasurer, on the settlement of accounts of persons having claims on the commonwealth, and who at the same time may be indebted to the commonwealth, to secure the amount so due, or so much thereof as the claim of the commonwealth may amount to.” The neglect of the accountant officers to retain the money paid for contingent expenses and the salary of the surveyor general, will discharge the sureties.</p>
