It may therefore be taken for granted as it was in 8 <em>Watts $ Serg. </em>43, on similar grounds, that “the legislature intended that thereafter they should be executed.” The administration of justice suffers as well as the legal profession, if the statute and common law especially, when required in the institution of legal proceedings, be not observed.</p>

In Bemas vs. Quiggle it is said that if there was a suit there was no reference at common law. This is true of its policy prior to the reign of 2d Charles, in which however a scheme was devised by the court for the introduction of another, where action had been commenced; according to that, a rule of coiu’t was granted on consent of the parties litigant, to refer merchants’ accounts and such like perplexing matters before the jury, and on that rule the award was enforced by process of contempt. This practice received legislative sanction in 9 and 10 <em>Wm. </em>3d ch. 15, extended to this State, which embodied it for the excellence of the process to compel performance, and extended it to the ancient submission, where no suit had been brought: <em>Kid. </em>21, and <em>Ship-pin’s Opinion, </em>p. 326-8. Two kinds of this mode of trial were therefore known in the common law. But this submission and award agrees with neither of them — not with the first, since here an action was pending, nor with the second, since that had its only foundation in a consent of the parties to a rule of court, being indeed the handiwork of the court in its inceptive structure first authorized by the parties. It cannot therefore be maintained under the statute or common law, and hence it is set aside by the court. D. Krause.</p>

    <p id="b98-7" data-blocks='[["BL_98.5",98,[313,1106,1167,1205]]]'>Thus far nothing is perceived which calls for interference with the judgment rendered below. But after reflection and examination of the authorities, we are satisfied the court fell into mistake in rejecting the proffered repetition of the late Edward Sweeny’s testimony, before the referees, as reduced to writing, by the defendant’s counsel. It is conceded that, generally, what a deceased witness said, on a- former trial of the same cause, may be thus proved. But the court rejected the evidence, because, as it was thought, the submission under which the cause went to arbitrament, was merely null, for which reason it was set aside on exceptions filed; from whence it results that what took place before the referees, was- <em>coram non judice, </em>and therefore ineffective for any purpose. In considering this proposition, it may be admitted that to warrant the introduction of secondary proof, of the character here proposed, the jurisdiction of the tribunal before which the dead witness testified, must be established; since without the power to <em>determine, </em>the ancillary right to investigate, <em>per testes, </em>cannot exist. But it must also be agreed that if, in setting aside this award, the court proceeded upon an erroneous assumption of the invalidity of the submission, the evidence offered ought not to be affected by the mistake <em>; </em>for it owed its competency, not to the continued existence of the award, but to the original power to make it. Thus, such testimony is available, after a new trial granted, 2 <em>Starkies Ev. </em>327 ; or a judgment reversed; Noble <em>vs. </em>McClintock, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0058-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 58" data-case-ids="480126" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0058-01">6 <em>Watts &amp; Serg. </em>58</a>, neither of which subsequent facts is permitted to impeach it. In estimating its sufficiency, therefore, we are to enquire, on original ground, irrespective of the mere destination of the award.</p>
    <p id="b98-8" data-blocks='[["BL_98.6",98,[318,2319,1159,134]],["BL_99.1",99,[171,418,1169,656]]]'>The record informed us that four exceptions were taken to this award, three of which touched the sufficiency of the submission. We have been favored with a copy of the opinion, delivered on the <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>hearing of the rule to set aside the award, and from it we learn, that the rule was made absolute, because it was thought the submission was one unknown to our law. Though an action at law was pending, to which the submission expressly referred, it was said it could not be recognized as under the old act of 1705, or the more modern one of 1836, because these required a consent, expressed in the agreement to refer, that it should be made a rule of court. Besides, these statutes require an approval of the award by the court; whereas this agreement stipulated only for the action of the Prothonotary, in entering judgment; that it could not be taken as under the second and succeeding sections of the act of 1806, for that also required the submission to be made a rule of court; and fourth, that the award should be under seal; a form not exacted in this instance. But all our adjudications on this subject shew these objections to be too refined.</p>
    <p id="b99-5" data-blocks='[["BL_99.4",99,[170,1072,1175,1395]],["BL_100.1",100,[339,415,1165,696]]]'>Our policy has been to encourage the settlement of litigation, through the intervention of roferrees; a domestic tribunal, which long experience had shewn to be very useful and appropriate, in a large variety of cases. The courts have therefore refused to listen to merely formal objections, whether directed against the submission itself, or addressed to the award. Herman <em>vs. </em>Freeman 9, <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>9. It was accordingly long ago settled, that the insertion of a formal agreement to make the submission a rule of court, is not necessary to its efficiency, under either the acts of 1705 or 1806, whenever an action is pending, to which the submission makes reference. Such consent will be implied, whenever the intent of the parties is apparent, and a simple reference to the pending action is held to make it so in the absence of a contradictory provision. It is unnecessary to run over all the cases that shew this. It may suffice to refer to Harris <em>vs. </em>Hayes, <a href="/binn/6/0422-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Binn. 422" data-case-ids="1795138" data-case-paths="/binn/6/0422-01">6 <em>Bin. </em>422</a>, Large <em>vs. </em>Passmore, <a href="/serg-rawl/5/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Serg. &amp; Rawle 51" data-case-ids="1804301" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/5/0051-01">5 <em>Serg. &amp; Rawle </em>51</a>, Bemus <em>vs. </em>Quiggle, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20364" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 Watts 364">7 <em>Watts </em>364</a>, where' Mr. Justice Huston said he and his brethren thought they had never in fact known an instance, where it was expressly stated the reference was under a rule of court; that as the parties had a right so to refer, and could not be restrained by the court, it would be idle to ask for such a rule, and it never was asked; and in Kimmel <em>vs. </em>Shank, 1 <em>Serg. Rawle </em>24, where a pending cause was referred to three men <em>“ </em>on whose decision, or a majority of them, judgment to be entered by the Prothonotary,” it was held, that, as this reference could not be, under the compulsory arbitration law, it must be taken to be within the act of 1705. To these may be added Okison <em>vs. </em>Flickinger, 1 <em>Watls &amp; Serg. </em>257. There, though the court thought the award could not be supported, as within the provision of the act of 1806, because the submission did not expressly stipulate for a rule of court, there would be no difficulty in sustaining it, as within the act of 1705, which the act of 1836 has re-enacted, had the <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>award been signed by <em>all </em>the referees. In the particular under consideration, there is in truth no difference in the provisions of these two statutes, as the court of Common Pleas seems to have supposed. The same liberal spirit, which induced the courts to overlook mere form, in giving effect to the elder, is the governing sentiment, when construing the younger act. It is true that, in Benjamin <em>vs. </em>Benjamin <a href="/watts-serg/5/0562-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 562" data-case-ids="478797" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0562-01">5 Watts <em>&amp; Serg. </em>562</a>, a case where at the time of the submission, there was no pending action, nor any agreement to enter one, it was thought the award made, could not be brought within the act of 1886, for want of a consent rule. But I think all the prior determinations shew this authority to be inapplicable where there are actions in court to which the submission refers, or a simultaneous agreement to commence one, for then there is a plain implication of an intended rule. And according to Massey <em>vs. </em>Thomas, <a href="/binn/6/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Binn. 333" data-case-ids="1795141" data-case-paths="/binn/6/0333-01">6 <em>Bin. </em>333</a>, the same implication obtains under the provisions of the act of 1806.</p>
    <p id="b100-6" data-blocks='[["BL_100.4",100,[340,1111,1165,176]]]'>As to sealing the award it is dispensed with by the act of 28th March, 1808; Dunlop 257. Without, therefore, any particular straining, I am of opinion the award in question might have been upheld, under either of the statutes I have mentioned.</p>
