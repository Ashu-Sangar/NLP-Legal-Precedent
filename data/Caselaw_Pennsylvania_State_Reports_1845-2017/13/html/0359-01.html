The deed bears date 13th April, 1830, and acknowledges in the usual form, the payment of the consideration money, — $850. $100 was really paid at the time, and Mr. Jackson’s note taken for the balancé. This, as David Summerville testifies, was held until the 19th October, 1837, and on that day exchanged for Mr. Garber’s note. After Mrs. Summerville’s death, her administrator returned this note as a part of the assets belonging to her estate, in the inventory filed 30th March, 1841; and in his administration account, passed 1st January 1846, he charges himself with the money received upon it, taking credit for sundry small, usual disbursements, and for various sums paid to the different heirs. He received the last of the money from Mr. Garber’s executor, the 21st of January, 1847; and proves that he paid to the various heirs of his mother their respective shares of the balance in his hands as her administrator, “as nearly as he could guess.” It is also proven by Lazarus Lowry, that on the 7th or 8th March, 1832, George Elliott said to Mrs. Summerville, — “Mrs. Summer-ville, Dr. M’Clelland, [who it appears was her relative] says you can get clear of that bargain,” referring to the contract with Jackson; to which she replied, “ why should I wish to get rid of it — they gave me all I asked,” &amp;c. It is also shown that after this, on the 18th October, 1839, she drew an order on Mr. Garber <a id="p363" href="#p363" data-label="363" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*363</a>for $90, and upon which that sum was paid; and also shewn, by the testimony of Robert Campbell, that in the fall of 1839, he was solicited by James Summerville one of the plaintiffs, on behalf of his mother, to undertake the management of a suit against Thomas Jackson, for the recovery of this land. And these facts, it is argued, in view especially of the time which has elapsed, and the improvements made on the property, work an equitable estoppel, and bar recovery in this action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b365-5" data-blocks='[["BL_365.4",365,[191,751,1182,1248]]]'>The ground, however, we answer, on which the plaintiffs rely, and upon which alone they can recover, if they recover at all, is that of actual, positive fraud, — fraud in deed, and not legal or constructive fraud — in the procurement of the conveyance. In such case it will not be pretended it was incumbent on the plaintiffs to refund, or tender the original consideration money, before bringing their suit; and if they were not bound to refund or tender, could the retaining and using of it work an estoppel ? The contract for the land was complete, when the deed receipted was executed and delivered. The money due upon the note, first of Jackson and afterwards of Garber, was in our view, as if it had been in the hands of some other person on loan, or had remained unused in Mrs. Summerville’s possession until her death, and afterwards passed, as a part of her estate, to her heirs. Knowledge, on the part of the defendants, if the money had actually come into her hands at the date of the deed, that she retained and used it without complaint until her death, would have afforded them as strong evidence and assurance of <em>acquiescence </em>even, as the knowledge that it remained in their own hands. But, if the contract was of the character alleged, it was not the subject of after confirmation by the mere acquiescence, or by acts merely amounting to the acquiescence of the party; and the <em>money </em>in question was the original, and the receipt and use of it as here shown not a new, or in our view, in any sense except one purely fictitious, operating as a new consideration. And, whatever weight the evidence on this point should have on the minds of the jury, as tending to illustrate the character of the original transaction, we are of opinion that it does not estop the plaintiff, and shut out proof of <em>actual, positive </em>fraud.</p>

And this involves a two-fold inquiry: First, were the alleged misrepresentations, as to the lien of Peters’ heirs, actually made by Jackson, or Jackson and Garber, or either of them, (for there is no evidence that Mr. Porter had any part in the making of the bargain) to Summerville and wife when the contract was made, and the deed executed and delivered ?

If such misrepresentations were made, and Summerville and wife were so misled and deceived, and induced to part with their title for less than its value, it was such fraud as would render the contract and the deed, void.

These last are merely voidable, and may be affirmed. But those which are void for actual fraud, cannot be affirmed by the party defrauded. Essentially a legal nonenity, even legal proceedings and judgments founded upon them must give way before the claim of the injured victim. In this case, the decree of partition had been made by the court; after which, Jackson, the defendant, purchased the title of Summerville and wife, one of the parties to the partition, and appeared in court, with his deed, and claimed to represent the Summervilles, and, as their representative, elected to take the land at the appraisement, which was awarded to him by the court, and the partition ordered to be firm and stable forever.</p>

The evidence offered and admitted conduced to prove the most startling and appalling fraud, by which extreme old age and imbecility were overcome by concerted falsehood and contrivance on the part of men of weight and character, in one of whom the deceived parties had unbounded confidence, and by means of which falsehood they were induced to make a deed for their purpart, for less than half its value. The evidence tended to prove, not only a fraud upon the Summervilles, but upon the court; and its admission was only a just vindication of the dignity and purity of the judicial tribunals, and the public justice of the country. If the deed from Summerville had been forged, what just man will say that a decree procured by it ought not to give way to the violated rights of the party defrauded ? And what is the difference, in <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>the eye of elevated morals, between a deed forged, and one procured by falsehood and covin ? In the eye of the law, there is a difference. One is punished as a crime, and in the other, the party is only deprived of his ill-gotten gains. The principle that the judgments and decrees of courts, procured by actual fraud, are null to the extent of the fraud, as against the party defrauded, is as old as the times of Lord Coke, and is familar in our own jurisprudence : Mitchell <em>vs. </em>Kintzer, 5 <em>Barr, </em>216, and the cases there cited, in the opinion of the court.</p>

    <p id="b371-7" data-blocks='[["BL_371.5",371,[185,1016,1180,828]]]'>But there never was a judgment or decree upon the question, whether the deed from Summerville to Jackson was obtained by fraud. That decree was rendered upon the faith of the fact, that the Summervilles were legally and honestly represented by Jackson. But if the deed were fraudulent and void, the title never passed out of the Summervilles, but still resides in their legal representatives. Whilst, therefore, the decree is good as against the interest honestly represented before the court, it is void as against the interests not representeffall; that is, not represented in the eye of the law. As to that interest, the law takes it up now, just where the fraud and covin found it, and wrests it from the spoiler. As to that interest, the decree of the court was, as it were, <em>coram non judice. </em>Where parties have been heard, or due notice has been given, the judgment or decree of a court, upon the point in issue, cannot be overturned, in a collateral proceeding, upon an allegation of mistake or error. That is the law. But where fraud has been used by the party, and enters into the procurement of the decree, the law holds up the mirror of truth, and it fades away.</p>

There had been some spark of evidence, that before that time — at all events, before the payment of Garber’s note to her representatives, the fraud had exploded, and became known to the Summervilles. But the taking the new note, and afterwards receiving the amount, was not such a new contract, for sufficient consideration, as, in the eye of the law, would make a new arrangement, by which the old contract would be virtually re-enacted. It was a mere continuation of the old arrangement, without any additional consideration, substituting her particular friend, Garber, in place of Jackson, not so well known to her. But the reception of the money by the legal representatives of Mrs. Summerville, operated no estoppel, either in equity or law. They had a right to receive that money, and the law so adjudged it, as á just punishment for covin and fraud. A fraudulent vendee gains no title to land by the sale, whilst at the same time, the vendor gains a good title to the purchase money. The policy of the law, as a punishment to the fraudulent vendee, gives to the vendor a title to the money, which is not repugnant to, but consistent with his title to the land: Gilbert <em>vs. </em>Hoffman, <a href="/watts/2/0066-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="2 Watts 66" data-case-ids="1840142" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0066-01">2 <em>Watts, </em>66</a>; Smull <em>vs. </em>Jones, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20138" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 138">1 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>138</a>. But it is sufficient on this head to say, that no lapse of time, nor any act of confirmation by the party defrauded, even with a full knowledge of the facts, can restore and make vital a contract dead on account of actual fraud. A new contract, for additional consideration, may be made; but the old is forever gone. Once a cheat, the thing so remains: Duncan <em>vs. </em>M’Cullough, 4 <em>S. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>485; Chamberlain <em>vs. </em>McLurg, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2036" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 36">3 <em>W. </em>&amp; <em>S. </em>36</a>; <em>Coke Littleton, </em>2146.

They were strongly impressed and urged by the court to be careful and circumspect. They were told that fraud was not to be presumed, but must be clearly made out to their satisfaction. Fraud, undoubtedly, may be inferred from facts proved, clearly leading to that conclusion. But the fraud here did not rest on inference: there was distinctly proved the <em>suggestio falsi, </em>for the purpose of misleading — the positive acts of circumvention, &amp;c. But the question of actual fraud was fairly submitted to the jury, and they have found it. It is now above and beyond our reach in that respect.</p>

There was some evidence of a deed having been made, by Jackson, to A. P.

It was therefore entitled to no weight, one way or the other, in the cause. A deed to which nothing but legal fraud is imputed, will not protect a purchaser, without notice, unless the money is actually paid; otherwise, he is a mere volunteer: Bolton <em>vs. </em>Johns, 5 Barr, 145. Much more would the purchaser lack protection, when the fraud was actual and flagrant, unless he had actually paid the purchase money. The whole force of the beneficent principles of equity might easily be frustrated by contrivances, unless the law was so held. On the whole, we see no error in this record.</p>
