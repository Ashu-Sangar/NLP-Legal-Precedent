The whole tract of land containing one hundred and sixty-four acres, was held by Phineas Baker, the decedent, at the time of his death, and his brother Evan Baker, the defendant, subject to the payment of a mortgage for $1650, the interest to be paid to their mother, Ann Baker, during her life, and at her death the principal to be paid to the heirs and legal representatives of their father, Levi Baker, deceased. It is not distinctly stated how the two brothers derived their title, but as it is incidentally noticed that the amount for which interest was to be paid to their mother, was her dower, as it is denominated, out of the land, it is probable that the brothers took the tract in the distribution of their father’s estate, at its appraised value. One of the conditions of the sale, as proved, was as follows: <em>“ </em>The premises are sold subject to the lien or mortgage for the sum of $1650, one half thereof, being the portion payable by ‘Phineas Baker, deceased, will remain on the land, the interest thereof to be paid annually to Ann Baker, widow of Levi Baker, diming her life, and the principal at her death, to be paid to the heirs and legal representatives of the said Levi Baker, deceased. Appended to the condition of sale is a written acknowledgment, by the defendant, that he purchased according to the conditions, and of his indebtedness for the amount of the purchase money. The administrator returned the sale, which was approved by the court; whereupon he executed a deed, duly acknowledged to the defendant, for the one-half of the one hundred and sixty-four acres, for the consideration of $5,740. In which deed was recited the proceedings in the orphans court, the sale and confirmation, and delivered the said deed to the defendant, who gave him his note for the balance, after deducting the payments, which the defendant had made.

That it was a judicial sale, and that the rule of <em>caveat emptor </em>applied with full force to the purchaser, the authorities therefore, which were cited by the defendant’s counsel, would seem to be wide of the mark. In every contract there must be persons capable to contract. But what authority has the cryer of a judicial sale to make a contract to bind the creditors and the heirs. They are represented by the court, at whose order the sale is made. They make the conditions of sale. The cryer having read the conditions of sale, every one present had full notice, and it was the duty of every bidder to look to the conditions. Every body knows that there is a sort of art or eloquence belonging to cryers, which they are fond of displaying in a multitude of words; but in a case of <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>this kind, that misleads no man of ordinary prudence. But it is safer that an unwary man, who did not or would not adopt the necessary precaution, made obligatory upon Mm by force of the rule of <em>caveat emptor, </em>should, in consequence of negligence, occasionally suffer hardships, than that a general rule of public policy, adopted for the safety of all, should be disregarded. The declations of the cryer, after he had publicly read the conditions of sale, in direct hostility to them, were not evidence. If the purchaser was misled by these declarations, he had his day in court for relief. He might have applied to the court to set the sale aside, and not confirm it, to Ms prejudice. It is alledged that he was not bound to do this, because the return was the act of the administrator alone. He was, however, bound to do so. Let the buyer take care, by all reasonable and accessible means, to protect himself. If he will not do it, the well established system cannot be broken up, to assist Ms negligence. But it would appear that he well knew what he was about; he signed an acknowledgment at the foot of the conditions that he had purchased according to those conditions, one of which was that the purchaser took subject to the incumbrance. He accepted a deed, in which these proceedings were all recited, and to which was appended a receipt by the administrator for the whole amount of the purchase money, which he put upon record. The estate is therefore irrevocably gone from the heir and the creditor, and vested in the defendant.</p>

If admitted for the purpose of countervailing the judicial proceedings of the Orphans’ Court, and the recorded acts of the parties to the transaction, there would be no stability for the future ; creditors and heirs, and trustees, would be subject to the vague, loose and evanescent impressions of a noisy and sometimes turbulent multitude, assembled at vendues. And there would be little security in titles depending upon judicial sales, in by-gone time. All the analogies of the law are against such evidence, and a case determined at the December term, and not yet reported, is in point, with this difference only, that the sheriff was the actuary there, and here the administrator ; but both effecting a judicial sale.'</p>
