Of this there seems to be no reasonable doubt.

During nineteen years of that time the alienee of Robert Reed was in the actual adverse possession of the estate under the deed. The deed being acknowledged before two justices of the peace in the county of Jefferson, in the state of Kentucky, who were <em>ex officio </em>judges of the county court, and the fact of their being such duly certified by the clerk of the county court, and a certificate of the presiding judge of the county accompanying the same.

It is contended by the appellee that the interest of Robert Reed, the <em>cestui que trust, </em>was personal estate, that he had no interest in the realty, and could not sell or convey it. I may as well, at the outset, deliver this point from Harris’' and Forster, 10 <em>Barr, </em>457. That the marrow of the case' is, that the personalty was not intended by the parties to be sold and bought, and that not only the intent of'the parties but the Ian- ' guage of the deed was fulfilled by the transfer of the realty, and ■ that not one cent was paid for the personalty.' The same remark will cover the- cases cited in relation to party .walls; - But here what the appellee calls personal estate,' was: the very subject matter ' of the contract, and nothing else was "embraced. The parties sold - and bought,-and the price Was- paid under a full conviction that - the- interest of the vendor was an interest in the real estate.- The deed passed that, or it passed nothing.- I agree to- the -cases cited <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>by the appellee, to show that where lands are devised to be sold, and the proceeds are distributed, that a judgment against a distributee cannot sell the fee in the land. These cases are sound law, and the reason is that the distributee has no interest whatever in the land; his interest is in the surplus of the money in the executor’s hands after the lands have been sold. Rut this case is different, and not within the dominion of those cited. Because the testator devised the real estate to his brother and three sons as follows: “All the rest of my estate, real and personal, I devise and bequeath in manner following: one equal fourth part to my brother, James Reed, his heirs, &amp;c.; one like fourth part to my son James, by Eleanor Elliott, his heirs, &amp;c.; one like fourth part to my son Henry, by Martha Patton, his heirs, &amp;c.; and the other like fourth part to my son Robert, by Elizabeth Wise, his heirs,” &amp;c. He directs that Ms executors shall rent the lands until they are sold, and apply the rents to the maintenance of his sons, and then directs his executors to sell the lands, and divide the money. Here is a distinct devise of one-fourth part of the house and lot to his son Robert. In the circumstances of the parties we are furnished with the reason why the testator directed his executors to sell the house and lot, and other real estate, if he had any. It seems that he was a gentleman who browsed at large; his children were minors, to be maintained and educated, and probably, with their respective mothers, lived in different states where he had sojourned. The actual partition of the property would, therefore, be attended with difficulty. The testator, therefore, gives his executors a power to sell the lands which he had devised to his sons, at their discretion, for the benefit of his sons, the rent, in the meantime, to go to their maintenance. In principle it is the same as if a testator had devised land to a son and his heirs, and appointed a testamentary guardian, with power to sell for the maintenance and education of the son, and a neglect of the guardian to sell until the son arrived at age. We are of opinion that Robert Reed had such an equity, at least in the house and lot in Pittsburgh, and arising or accrueing out of it, as enabled him to sell Ms share, and that whatever interest that was, would pass, subject to the debts of the testator, as in case of a direct devise of the fee, by the deed to George Wallace, the younger. This view of the case conflicts with no adjudicated case, and is in harmony with several, and seems to be fully borne out by Jarman on Wills, a treatise of great respectability and authority. Thus he says, page 587: “But although it is not in the power of an owner of an undivided share, or any partial interest in property, which is directed to be converted, by Ms single act to change its character, and thereby impart to it a different transmissible quality, it does not follow that every disposition by such partial owner, adapted to the the property in its actual state, is irregular.” In tMs case, the <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>deed was adapted to the actual state of the property by the owner. He had waited until his advent to lawful age. The property was unconverted, the executors dead; it was necessary far him to have its value; it could not be divided, and he sells for a full and fair price, and had the benefit of it, perhaps fourfold, in the lapse of time. During his life, he makes no objection; after his death, a mere volunteer, the administrator de bonis non of the estate, attempts to rake up from the depositories of time, some technical defect, to deprive the devisee of George Wallace, the younger, of the price paid for the land about forty years ago. The common sense and common honesty of mankind revolt against the claim of the appellee. Mr. Jarman cites many cases to show that conveyances, as land, of the shares in the proceeds of land directed to be sold, pass the interest in the proceeds. So that the deed of Robert Reed, if it did not pass an interest in the realty, did, nevertheless, pass the proceeds produced, and this would be quite adequate to the case of the appellant. <em>All </em>that the devisee of George Wallace seeks is the product of his share of the sale. In the case of Hay <em>vs. </em>Mayer, <a href="/watts/8/0212-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="8 Watts 212" data-case-ids="1848433" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0212-01">8 Watts, 212</a>, Mr. Justice Kennedy says: They (the devisees) had no interest in the land. Each had a right to receive a certain portion of the proceeds thereof, when made, according to the directions and provisions of the will. Their claims, however, may be considered as assignable in equity, for a valuable consideration,-and their deeds, as sufficient to bind and divest them in equity, at least, of their rights to any money that could be raised from a sale of the land under this power. This case goes beyond the exigencies of the present, and establishes, that if the interest of Robert Reed was nothing more than personalty, he would be bound and estopped from claiming any part of the money produced by the sale, under the power made by the administrator de bonis non. Lord Chancellor Gilbert said, <em>Equity Rep. </em>144: For as the husband intended to divest himself of the whole fee, if it had been a fee, there was no reason, when it appeared to be a less interest, that this should not pass. This hits the exact view of the predicament of Robert Reed, as contended for by the appellee. He intended to convey real estate, if the interest was real estate; but, says the appellee, it was less, it was only personal. There is no reason, says Chancellor Gilbert, why that should not pass, if such was the interest. So that the interest of Robert Reed passed by his deed, whether it was real or personal estate, and the devisee of his alienee is entitled to the proceeds.</p>

Wallace, the younger, was one of the executors of George Wallace, the elder, who was executor of Reed, the testator, and that as both the executors of Reed were dead, in 1812, George Wallace, the younger, was the executor of Reed, and in making the <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>purchase was dealing with his <em>cestui que trust. </em>That is entirely different from dealing about, or buying the subject of the trust, without the assent of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>at judicial or other public sale. But even then, if the transaction was without fraud, and not against the interest of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>as when it sold for full value, he would not have an interest to demand a re-sale.</p>

But, however fair the transaction, it must be subject to an option in the cestui que trust, <em>if he comes in reasonable time, </em>to have a re-sale. Here time has cured all defects on this score. The volunteer administrator de bonis non, who never paid a cent, comes, on behalf of somebody, perhaps the heirs of Robert Reed, to demand the land and money for which Robert Reed was fully compensated and paid by George Wallace, the younger, in 1812. There is not a scintilla of evidence of fraud or circumvention; but all appears' fair and honest, and the price paid fully adequate. Robert Reed lived and died acquiescing in the arrangement and sale, and Wallace and his heirs were eighteen or nineteen years in actual possession. It is too late to-disturb the repose of the dead, or blacken the memory of Robert Reed, for the benefit of his heirs.</p>
