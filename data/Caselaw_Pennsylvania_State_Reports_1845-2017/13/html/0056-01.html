    <p class="summary" id="b58-12" data-blocks='[["BL_58.8",58,[337,1763,1171,598]]]'>This was an appeal from the judgment of a justice of the peace, in an action instituted by Freyman, against Frankenfield, to recover the price of a corn cutting machine, sold and delivered by the plaintiff, to the defendant, or so much as it was reasonably worth. Freyman took the machine to the house of Frankenfield; the latter objected that it was crooked, and was defective; Frey-man took away the machine to alter it: when the machine was put in good order, he was to be paid one half in cash, and to receive a note for the other half. It was dark when he brought back the machine. It was alledged, on the part of the defendant, that the machine was still defective when it was returned. Plaintiff did net see defendant, though he was at home; and did not ask for him. There was no evidence that plaintiff demanded payment before suit.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b59-6" data-blocks='[["BL_59.4",59,[171,551,1173,350]]]'>The plaintiff sold the machine to the defendant. There was some defect in it at the time of the sale, which the plaintiff undertook to remedy before he was to receive his pay for it. He took the machine away; and if you believe this is the same machine Crouse speaks of, had it repaired, and returned it to the defendant. How it worked afterwards does not appear; there is no evidence that the defendant ever used it for the purposes of its construction subsequent to its return.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b59-7" data-blocks='[["BL_59.5",59,[165,901,1180,471]]]'>If upon its return it did not work well; if it was not such a machine as the plaintiff had undertaken to make it, it was the defendant’s duty to have notified the plaintiff of the fact, or to have sent it back to him. The defendant did neither of these things. He cannot retain the machine and refuse to pay for it. And being now sued for the price, he can only set up the defectiveness of the machine as a partial defence. You will allow the defendant so much as the machine is worth less than it would be worth if it were perfect in all its parts; and, making that deduction, you will find in favor of the plaintiff such sum as, from the evidence, you take the machine to be worth.</p>

The machine was defective, and upon trial was found not to answer the purpose for which it was made. Freyman, the maker said he would take it home and mend it. He did so, and sent it back. It was never returned to him, and he was never notified that it did not work well.</p>

    <p id="AJp" data-blocks='[["BL_60.4",60,[367,541,1174,603]]]'>We think the court were right. Erankenfield has no lawful title to keep the machine, and the price.. The last contract was that Ereyman would take home the machine and amend the defect. This agreement waived an exact performance of the first. He did so, and as he thought in good faith, and took it back. Good faith and honesty required that Erankenfield should have informed the maker that it was still defective. As he did not do so, the other had a right to presume that he accepted it, and was satisfied. He brings his suit for the price, and then for the first time he is informed that the machine does not work well. As Erankenfield retained it, he made it his own, not objecting or giving notice to the other party of the defect. He ought to pay what it is worth, with the defect, if any; and the jimy pronounced on that part of the case. We see no error.</p>
