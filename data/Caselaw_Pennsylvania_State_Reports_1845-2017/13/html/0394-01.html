    <p class="summary" id="b396-12" data-blocks='[["BL_396.13",396,[323,2023,1180,211]]]'>The 34th sec. of the act of 16th June, 1836, relating to reference and arbitration, gives a stay of execution on award of arbitrators for twenty days from the filing of the award, during which the losing party may appeal. See Woods <em>vs. </em>Conner, 6 <em>Barr </em>430.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b396-13" data-blocks='[["BL_396.14",396,[329,2241,1169,220]],["BL_397.1",397,[202,423,1182,730]]]'>But this case is said not to come within that rule because the process here is. not strictly speaking an execution, but an attachment. I am of opinion that there is nothing in the distinction attempted to be taken. The 34th section above referred to, provides that the prothonotary shall, after twenty days, at the request <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>of the party in whose favor the award is made, issue execution, <em>or such other process </em>as may be necessary and proper to carry into effect the judgment on such award. Now when it is considered that this arbitration law was part of the codified system which first provided process for taking debts in execution, it cannot be reasonably doubted that the words <em>such other process </em>mean the attachment execution which was provided by the act of 16th June, 1836, relating to executions; if so this process is stayed for twenty days by the 34th sec. as expressby as a <em>fi. fa. </em>But the writ issued is an execution in every sense. A <em>sci. fa. </em>may be part of an execution and does not take away the executial character of the writ. It may, to be sure, bring new parties into court and produce new litigation between them, but this is all in execution of the original judgment. As to that judgment, every thing that is done to produce the money rests on the judgment for its foundation, and is to be regarded as execution of the judgment. The rule must be made absolute.</p>
