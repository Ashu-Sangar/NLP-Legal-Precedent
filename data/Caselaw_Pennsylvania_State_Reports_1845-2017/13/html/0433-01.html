Much evidence has been given to the jury on the subject, to show that the warrant of Peter Osborne, under which the plaintiff claims, was not actually located, and the survey actually made upon the ground; and that, therefore, Reed, under whom the defendants claim, had a right to include it within his lines, and take a warrant for it, and have it surveyed, and aj&gt;propriated to himself, in 1829.</p>

If there is not, and we must say we have not been able to discover any, then the plaintiff is entitled to recover. The only evidence on the subject is the testimony of Adam Wilt, who says: “When we were locating Reed’s claim, he told us to stop, we would go no farther south; that he had heard of a claim of land there, and then we went an east course; I guess we were then on the land now in dispute; I think we were, but I did not know the <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>boundaries of it then.” And whether this included any of the Osborne survey or not, we cannot say.

Under the common law, as it existed from the first settlement of the province up to that period, the claimant of the land served a copy of the declaration against the casual ejector, who gave notice, in writing appended to the declaration, to the tenant in possession, in which the casual ejector informed the defendant that he had no title, and advised him to appear, by attorney, at the proper court, and, by a rule, he could cause himself to be made defendant in his stead; otherwise, he would suffer judgment, and the defendant would be turned out of possession. The real defendant then appeared, and, by leave of the court, he was permitted to appear to the action, on confession of lease, entry and ouster. He denied the trespass alleged against <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>Mm, and put Mmself upon tbe country. Upon tbe trial, it was essential for the plaintiff to prove tbe defendant in possession, or be was non-suited: see tbe form of tbe record in tbe appendix to 3d <em>Black. Com., </em>and <em>Crompton’s Practice, </em>title, Ejectment. Tbe act of 1806 totally abolished this flummery, and gave a form, in which tbe real parties to tbe action were then placed on tbe record. Thus, in order to prevent surprise, tbe act directs that tbe plaintiff, on or before tbe first day of tbe term to wMch tbe writ is returnable, file a description of tbe land claimed, and directs tbe defendant to enter bis defence for tbe whole or any part thereof before tbe next term.</p>
    <p id="b438-6" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[318,892,1167,650]]]'>Tbe subsequent act of tbe 13th April, 1806, <em>Dunlop </em>255, directs the plea of not guilty. In this case, tbe counsel of tbe defendant appeared before tbe return of tbe writ, (no doubt to save costs,) and pleaded, as tbe act directs, “not guilty.” They filed no description, nor gave notice of tbe part they claimed. Tbe parties went to trial on tbe general issue. Tbe plaintiff proved bis title to tbe survey of Peter Osborne. Tbe defendants gave in evidence tbe improvement of Reed, and tbe warrant to Cox; and shewed they were tbe owners of that improvement and warrant; and insisted tbe Osborne survey was not made on tbe ground. In this they utterly failed, and the jury so found. Neither party shewed that tbe Osborne survey interfered with tbe improvement or warrant of tbe defendants, or bow far they interfered. The errors assigned on tbe trial, and to tbe charge of the court, arise out of tbe professional adroitness and skill of tbe counsel.</p>

Tbe act of 1807 changed our law on this subject. Tbe act makes it tbe duty of tbe defendant to enter bis defence (if any be bath) for tbe whole or any part of tbe land in the plaintiffs writ. Upon this tbe act forms tbe issue. Tbe defendant’s express duty is to shew, specifically, what part of tbe plaintiff’s survey be takes defence for. If be takes defence generally, by pleading not guilty, be takes it for tbe whole tract.
