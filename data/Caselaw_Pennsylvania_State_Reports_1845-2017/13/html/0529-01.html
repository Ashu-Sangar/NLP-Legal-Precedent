The boundaries of the land devised to plaintiff include the land in controversy. The line of Kurtz, called for, appears to have been well known to the devisor, and this is indicated in the devise of the one acre tract, adjoining Williamson, which brings the land of Samuel Bear up to that line at the southern end of the tract. He gives Samuel the land to the Kurtz line, and calls for no such boundary in the devise to David Bear. In the devise of the residue he describes the lands of which that residue consists, and excludes the -tract in <em>question </em>from the description. The other claims in the will show that the devisor did not intend to die intestate as to any part of his estate.</p>

The question arises on the last will and testament of David Bear. He devised to his son Samuel and to his heirs, “ all that certain tract of mountain land of nineteen acres, be it more or less, as surveyed and marked off, now in possession of his said son, situated in the Welch mountains, Earl township, adjoining lands of John Williamson andKurtz, and I also give and devise to my said son Samuel, and his heirs, that certain lot of about one acre of land, be it more or less, adjoining the said tract of nineteen acres and land of John Williamson, and also in possession of my said son.” By a draft returned of the divisions and devises in the will, of the mountain tract, the boundary of the last mountain lot, devised to Samuel, contains nine acres and sixty-five perches. The boundaries of the Williamson tract and the others mentioned in the will, are pre<a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>served, and there is no devise of any land within these'boundaries. This is what the will requires. He therefore gave the whole lot to Samuel, and the mistake <em>in quantity </em>cannot control the boundaries. We concur with the learned judge, that the quantity described in the will cannot control the boundaries. The lines of Williamson and Kurtz, as well as the nineteen acres which the small lot called for, were omitted in the devise' of the residue of his estate, under which the plaintiff 'claims.</p>
