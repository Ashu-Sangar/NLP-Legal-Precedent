Title Gaming. By the act of our legislature against gaming, Dunlop\u2019s Dig. 201, act of April, 22, 1794; 3 Smith\u2019s Laws 177, sec. 8, persons losing money at any game of address or hazard, play or game whatsoever, \u201cshall not be compelled to pay or make good the same; and every contract,- note, bill, bond, judgment, mortgage, or other security or conveyance whatsoever, given,granted, drawn or entered into, for the security or satisfaction of the same, or any part thereof, shall be utterly, void and of none effect.\u201d Both the English and American statutes render the contract, for payment, utterly void and of none, effect. In Bowyer vs. Bampton, 2 Strange 1155, the Court of King\u2019s Bench, after two full arguments, held that the innocent indorsee of a gaming note can maintain no action against the drawer. The question whether a bill of exchange, with a blank indorsement, being stolen and negotiated to an innocent indorsee, could be recovered, came before Lord Mansfield, Doug. 636, Peacock vs. Rhodes, and another, and his Lordship, in delivering the opinion of the court, declared that he was glad that this question was saved, not for its difficulty, but because it -is important that general .commercial points sh\u00f3uld be publicly decided.\nHe declared the law to be settled, \u201cthat a holder, coming fairly .by the bill or note, has nothing to do with the transaction between the original parties, except perhaps in 'the single case,- (which he calls- a hard one,) of a n\u00f3te for money won at play.\u201d Lee, C. J; puts it on the same ground, viz: that the statute makes it void to all intents and purposes. The gamester makes use of the note to' pay his own debt, or to receive money'on it. If .the innocent indorsee is to recover, it will be a means to evade the act, it being so difficult to prove notice to the indorsee; \u201c and though it will be some inconvenience to an innocent man, yet .that will not be a balance to those on the other side. And the plaintiff is not without remedy; for he may sue (the indorser) on his indorsement.\u2014 And it is but the common hazard of taking notes of infants or feme coverts,\u201d 2 Strange 1155. The argument here is that commerce is to be encouraged, and therefore we ought to decide in favor of. an innocent indorsee. I am well satisfied that we shall, not send a vessel\u2019less to sea, by taking from commerce the uncertain aid of faro banks and other gaming tables.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

Boas, to recover on a note dated in April, 1846, for f200. The Note was payable to the order of Boas, and by him indorsed.\u2014 The plaintiff claimed as being an innocent indorsee, without notice, and that the note was taken by him for a valuable consideration.\nDefence was made on the ground that the note was given for a gaming debt at the time and place of play, and that it was void; that the defendant was playing at a 'faro table, in the city of Philadelphia, and that he gave the note in suit, and a number of other notes of the same character, in exchange for ivory checks, or counters, used at the gaming table, and afterwards lost the checks at the game. The notes were taken as money by the banker.\nHis Honor, Pearson, J., charged the jury that if the note was given under these circumstances, it was utterly void in the hands of the present holder.\nYerdict was rendered for defendant.\nIt was assigned for error:\nThat the. court erred in charging that a negotiable note, if originally given for a gaming consideration, is void in the hands of an innocent indorsee, for value.\nThe case was argued. by Berryh\u00fcl, for plaintiff in error.\nHe contended that the paper was protected by the principles of commercial law; that though it had been decided in England that such a note was void in the hands of an innocent holder for value, yet this was because the English statute would not bear any other construction; but he contended that the language of our act of IT94 was not so conclusive, Purdon 535, sec. 8. He cited 7 Barr 476; 2 Barr 103; 15 Johns. 44; Wash. C.
