Else, why assign the whole, if only the half was to be sold for payment of particular debts ; or why hold the trust subject to the order of the assignor till it should be convenient to make it a part of the road, and thus freed from levy and sale ? Evidently, to use the fraudulent ownership of the assignee as a cover to keep off execution creditors. It is strange that corporations should resort to contrivances so flimsy and transparent.\nThe non-suit was properly ordered.\nJudgment affirmed.",

But no payment whatever shall be made to any person or persons who shall not receive from the said engineer of the said railroad company a certificate as aforesaid that they are contractors, and that the said payments are to be made to them for work actually done and materials furnished for the purpose of completing the said road.\n4th.

E. Dougherty, Cashier of the Mech. & Trad. Ins. Co. Philadelphia.\n(Signed) S. Badger,\nPresident of the Mech. & Trad. Ins. Co. of Phil\u2019a.\nPhiladelphia, May 22, 1840,\nOn the 17th of June, 1842, the Mechanic\u2019s and Tradesmen\u2019s Insurance Company resigned the trust, and Samuel Hart was duly appointed by the court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia county, trustee under the assignment, under the application of the principal creditors.\nAfter the assignment to the Mechanic\u2019s and Tradesmen\u2019s Insurance Company, certain cross-ties were delivered on the road by James McFarland, the defendant, for which he obtained judgment, under which he levied and sold the iron. For this the present action of trespass was brought by Hart against him, and the sheriff and his deputy.\nOn the trial of the cause, after the evidence on both sides was closed, the court, at the request of the defendant\u2019s counsel, decided that the assignment of May 22, 1840, was void on its face \u2014 that it was made to hinder, delay and defraud creditors, and therefore void \u2014 that there was no sufficient delivery of the property assigned, and that said assignment was void on that account; and ordered a non-suit.\nTo all which decisions the plaintiff excepted, assigning them as error, as also the decision of the court, overruling the objection of jdaintiff\u2019s counsel, and admitting Thomas M. Rush to answer the question put by defendant\u2019s counsel, whether the members of the Norristown and Yalley Railroad Company considered the assignment of May 22, 1840, invalid and had no confidence in it.\nPerhins, fox plaintiff in error,\nargued that there was no want of form in the execution or recording of the assignment; that it was for the payment of debts and charges, and not for so large a fart of the assignor\u2019s property as to make the transaction colorable ; and cited 5 Term.
