      <em>July </em>26. Commissioners were appointed upon the petition of citizens of Union and West Buffalo townships, to inquire into the propriety of erecting a new township out of parts of those townships. The commissioners reported that they had viewed the townships mentioned in the order of view, and the parts proposed to be erected into a new township, and that they did find certain boundaries, describing them, and that they were of opinion that the territory, included within the lines marked red in the diagram annexed to their report, ought to be erected into a separate township, to be called Limestone. To this report exceptions were taken, which were overruled in the court below, and the report of the commissioners was approved and confirmed. This <em>certiorari </em>was then sued out; and, among other errors assigned in this court, was one that “ the commissioners do not report whether they have made inquiry into the propriety of erecting the said new township.”</p>

In this respect, the report is deficient. The commissioners say, “We the undersigned commissioners are of opinion that the territory included within the lines marked red in the annexed diagram, ought to be erected into_ a separate township, to be called Limestone township.”</p>
