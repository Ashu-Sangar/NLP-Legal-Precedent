He was removed by an order of two justices to Hartley, from which order the overseers of Hartley appealed to the Quarter Sessions, who quashed the order of removal. The question was, whether, under the evidence, Samuel D. Long, having a wife and children, had acquired a settlement in Hartley township. The provision in the act of 1836, under which the settlement is claimed, is contained in specification 3, of §9 of that act; Dunlop, 631, 2, viz. “By any person who shall, <em>bond fide, </em>take a lease of any real estate of the yearly value of ten dollars, and shall dwell upon the same for one whole year, and pay the said rent.” The evidence was clear that Long and his family resided for about two years at Berlin Iron Works, in Hartley township. He came in 1845, when they were building the furnace, and worked by the day for some time. On the 4th July, 1845, he went in the furnace as keeper, at $22 per month ; <em>he had a house and garden, and fire-wood into the bargain; </em>part of the time his wages were increased to $24 per month. He was there more than a year after this. <em>The house was considered part of his wages. He was told the house-rent was a good lift to him; </em>when his wages were raised to $24 per month, he wanted $26. <em>He was told by the manager that he ought to consider the house and privileges that he had, at least worth </em>$2 <em>a month. He was told what rent he would have to pay at other places. </em>He considered and admitted it was so. <em>The house had a garden, and ivas a story and a half high, with a small hitchen to it.</em>
