The town lots, excepting the school lots, were disposed of by lottery. In the deeds to the persons who drew lots, there was a reference to a recorded plan of the to.wn, which plan was not in fact recorded, though left in the Recorder’s office and intended to be recorded. It was received in evidence as an old plan, and in it these lots were designated as school lots. It was proved that M’Kee had repeatedly declared that he gave these lots for a school-house; that they had ever since been known as the school lots, though never used for school purposes. They were never claimed by M’Kee or by any of his heirs. M’Keesport has since been incorporated as a borough, and erected into a separate school district.</p>

Before the erection of the town, contemporaneously, into the double corporation of a borough and a school district, no individual could have maintained ejectment, the usual and best form of action for the possession, though perhaps any individual interested might have maintained an assize of nuisance. The action of ejection by <em>all the inhabitants </em>would be an impracticable action. If the inhabitants had appointed a committee to take charge of the lots, they would have had an equitable right to the possession: <a href="/us/27/0566-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Pet. 566" data-case-ids="11339253" data-case-paths="/us/27/0566-01">2 Pet. 566</a>, 584; and, I suppose, in Pennsylvania the right to maintain this action. Without this, and without any trustees, in whom the actionable title could be considered as vested, the protection of the property must be enforced in the name of the proper public authorities. The public will protect it for the designated uses. The usual form in which the public exercise this power, in such ease, in this state, is by indictment for nuisance.</p>

      <a id="p447" href="#p447" data-label="447" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*447</a>“That is an ejectment, criminal in form. In those countries where there is a court of chancery, the same thing is done in that court, but in a different form. Thus in England, the king, as <em>parens </em>patrias, is said to have the question tried on an information filed by his attorney-general, which is in fact an equitable ejectment, if the case requires it. And I do not know why a formal action of ejectment may not be maintained in Pennsylvania, in the name of the Commonwealth, to protect such rights, if there be no other competent plaintiff. This circumstance should not make the proceeding necessarily criminal.</p>

Now, by the incorporation of the town, there are designated local agents for the town. But it is said that these lots were not dedicated for common schools, as those are now established and regulated by law. True, but the dedication was not made for a law, or medical, or theological, or classical school, for it was intended for all the inhabitants and their families. Then what is nearer to the presumed intention of the grantor and of the inhabitants, the grantees in effect, than the common school as now established ? It seems to me, therefore, that the school directors of the district are the local authorities, to whom the custody of this property is committed by operation of law. Indeed this is the practice, perhaps, in all cases of dedications of land for other public purposes at the laying out of towns. When the town becomes incorporated, the town councils assume jurisdiction over such dedications as the proper owners, and I do not know that their right to do so was ever disputed; several of the cases already cited furnish illustrations of this. And why not? A principal object of their incorporation is to commit to the proper corporate authorities, those public rights and duties which are always badly attended to, when intrusted to the care of all, and the law presumes a general course to such commission of their rights and duties. In many instances the corporate limits are much more extensive than the original town, for the benefit of which the dedication was made, so that the thing dedicated is governed by a power not strictly representing those intrusted with governing the thing, according to the terms of the original grant. Here, however, the case is different.</p>

That he laid out the town in 1792 or 1793, and sold the lots by lottery, a practice common in Pennsylvania at that period; and that he reserved the lots in question and dedicated them, in the plan of the town, for the benefit of the inhabitants for school purposes. The lots lay waste and were sold a few years since for taxes, as unseated, and redeemed under the act of 1815, by the school directors, within the period allowed by law. The defendants have no title beyond their recent possession. M’Keesport was incorporated by the court of Allegheny county in 1842, and is a school district. Neither John M’Kee, in his lifetime, or his heirs since his decease, have laid claim to the lots in question; but at all times recognised them as school lots. It is contended that this is not such a title in the plaintiffs, as will enable them to maintain this ejectment, because the <em>cestui que trust </em>never took actual possession or erected a school-house upon the premises, and to render the dedication valid and binding, it was necessary that there be an acceptance by the public. It is true that this property was not held by trustees, but the dedication of these lots was for school purposes by the proprietor. He made them by that dedication appurtenant to the other lot-holders in the town, to whom he executed deeds of conveyance. In many of our towns, public grounds, market-places, lots for churches, graveyards, and schools, are held by gift and dedication. No formal conveyances have ever been made to the inhabitants, holding and enjoying such grants and gifts as appurtenant to their other real estate. Infinite mischief and injustice would ensue from questioning such rights or permitting them to be questioned by intruders. Nor the principle many cases might be cited. I need only refer to Rung <em>v. </em>Shoenberger, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%2025" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 W. 25">2 W. 25</a>, which goes far to’ establish the principle I have stated. These lots were an appurtenant and belonged for school purposes to the purchasers and owners of property in M’Keesport. The act of 1836, Dunlop, 629, and its supplements, vests all such school property in the school directors of the proper district, and enables them to maintain an ejectment against an intruder. There is no error in the learned opinion of the judge who tried the cause.</p>
