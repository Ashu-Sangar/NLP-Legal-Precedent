The administrators of Emmons were the plaintiffs, and Stahlnecker was defendant. The claim was for the price of 1100 pounds of bar iron, which the plaintiffs alleged was omitted in a settlement that took place between their intestate and the defendant.</p>

In the year 1841, Samuel Shannon traded Emmons a horse, valued at $60, for 1100 pounds of iron. The horse was shortly afterwards <a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>delivered to Emmons, but the iron was not sent to Shannon till the next winter. Shannon, however, not wanting the iron, and having some outstanding notes against him in favour of Mr. Hower, which Stahlnecker had got, an arrangement was made that Stahlnecker should get the iron that was coming from Emmons to Shannon for the horse; he therefore sets down in his book $60 against Emmons, till he should obtain the iron; and, according to the testimony of Samuel Shannon, he hauled the iron to Stahlnecker in the spring of 1842, at M’Ewensville, and weighed out to Stahlnecker the 1100 pounds of iron, and some more iron was left by Shannon for Stahlnecker at the same time at M’Ewensville. When Stahlnecker received this 1100 pounds of iron, as it paid the $60, he should have given credit for it to the account of Andrew Emmons; and the only question of difficulty is whether Stahlnecker credited Emmons with this iron on his book. On the 24th of February, 1843, a settlement was made between Andrew Emmons and David Stahlnecker, and a note was given under seal by Stahlnecker to Emmons, on that day, for $111, being the balance due Emmons on the settlement, as appeared by Stahlnecker’s books. Shortly after this, Emmons called on Mr. Shannon to go with him to Stahlnecker about a mistake Emmons alleged in the settlement. They went together, and Emmons told Stahlnecker that they had come to examine about the mistake of the credit, that Emmons should have had, of the 1100 weight of iron. David got the book, and they examined; the witness says he saw no account of that kind. . Emmons said, David, you have forgot to give me credit for that account of iron. David said, I guess it must be so, I will fix it again. David said he had kept a regular account of both debt and credit, and that he had credited all the iron he got, when they were before the justice. Where a settlement is made, it is presumptive evidence that it was honestly, fairly, and justly done; and he who wishes to overhaul the settlement, must satisfy the jury by clear and convincing evidence that there was an error or mistake.</p>

It appears that Emmons mentioned to Stahlnecker, before his death, that there was a mistake in the settlement; but nothing was done to correct it, if there was a mistake, in his lifetime, and he lived four .years after the settlement. This action is brought after the death of Emmons, to recover the amount of the mistake on settlement.</p>

And to allow it to be overcome by uncertain or <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>doubtful evidence, four, five, or six years after it was made, would not only subvert the law of evidence, but the law of justice. The court told the jury, that whether a mistake had been made in the settlement, was a question of fact for their determination, and that they must examine all the evidence, and determine accordingly. It was not error to add, that if they had reasonable doubts on the subject, these doubts ought to operate in favour of the defendant. Because the settlement and note .given in pursuance thereof was <em>primd facie </em>evidence that all was right, and it could only be obliterated by clear and satisfactory proof, otherwise no man would be safe, after having made a settlement of accounts and reposed upon it for years, and probably destroyed vouchers, or permitted them to be lost. Even taking the authority on which the ingenious counsel relies, Wharton’s Criminal Law, to wit, that there is “ A ground of distinction in this respect between civil and criminal cases. In the former, the jury weigh the testimony, and, after striking a fair balance, decide accordingly. But in criminal cases, the testimony must be such as to satisfy the jury beyond a doubt.” As the true and veritable rule on this subject, he is overborne by it. In <em>striking a fair </em>balance, that which is doubtful is not equal in weight to that which is certain in any well balanced mind. The scales of justice obey the impulse of what is certain and established, rather than that which is doubtful and shadowy, and therefore light.</p>

He left all the evidence to the jury, told them it was a question of fact for their decision; he gave no binding direction as to any fact, nor did he err on any question of law.</p>
