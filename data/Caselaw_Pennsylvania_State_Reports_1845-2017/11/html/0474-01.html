    <p class="summary" id="b474-9" data-blocks='[["BL_474.9",474,[308,1533,1175,245]]]'>This ejectment was brought to recover an undivided share of that plantation, as devisees thereof under this will, and also to recover certain other portions of it as heirs of two deceased intestate brothers, who were born before and were living at the death of the testator.

The rule on this subject is well settled. It is, that when land is given to one person for life, &amp;c., and, after the determination of that estate, it is devised over, whether to persons <em>nominatim, </em>or to a class of persons, it will vest in the object to whom the description applies at the death of the testator; and, when there is an immediate gift to children, those only living at the testator’s death will take: though, if there was a life-estate first given, with remainder over to the children of the tenant for life, then it would be different, and all the children <em>in esse </em>at the time of distribution would be entitled to equal shares. The remainder would vest in the children living at the testator’s death, subject to open and let in all others born before <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>the death of the tenant for life: 5 Barr, 504.

The error assigned was, that the court erred in charging that the plaintiffs could not recover as devisees under the will of Alexander Calhoun, deceased, and that only those children in ex-istencé at the death of the testator could take anything under the devise.</p>

Had he taken an estate, it would have been liable to judgment and execution by his creditors — the very thing, perhaps, which the testator designed to prevent. Besides, if a remainder, and not an immediate estate had been limited to the children, it could not have vested till John’s death ; but, by the terms of the devise, the plantation was to come into their possession, or into the possession of the executors for their use, at the testator’s death. There was no remainder, therefore, vested or contingent. As the land, then, was given, not to John with a limitation over to his children, but to them immediately^ the devise was not subject to open and let in children after-born; and none took who were not children at the testator’s death.</p>
