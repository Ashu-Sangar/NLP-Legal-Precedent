      <em>Sept </em>12. This was a proceeding, instituted before two aider-men by Daniel Potter, complainant, to recover possession of certain premises in Pittsburgh, under the act of 21st March, 1772.</p>

Thereupon the two aldermen issued their <em>venire, </em>returnable 9th April, 1849, on which day an inquisition was duly held and taken, whereby, among other things, it was found “ that the said William Hutchinson, by virtue of said demise, entered into possession of said demised premises, and held the same during said term, and is still possessed of the same, and the said term for which the said premises were demised is fully ended, and the said Daniel Potter being desirous, upon the said determination of said term, to have again and repossess the said premises, for that purpose did require the said William Hutchinson, on the determination of said term, to remove from and leave the same, and that the said William Hutchinson hath hitherto refused, and still doth refuse to comply with said demand and requisition to remove from and leave the said premises, and the said freeholders do assess damages against the said William Hutchinson for the unjust detention of said demised premises at eighty-five cents, besides all costs of suit.”</p>

The finding would have been legal. But this fact not being found, it is impossible to support this proceeding, as § 12, act 21st March, 1772, Dunlop’s Dig. 73, expressly requires that the demand had been made of the lessee or other person in possession to leave the premises three months before the application. The three months’ notice being for the benefit of the tenant, he may waive it in his written lease; but when the fact is so, it ought to be found by the inquest. In this case the tenant has no merits. The paper-book shows that his lease had expired before this proceeding commenced, and that he covenanted to deliver up the possession <em>without further notice. </em>We are constrained to quash the proceeding, but we will not award restitution.</p>
