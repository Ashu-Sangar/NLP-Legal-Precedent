      <em>Sept. </em>14. This was an action on the case by A. L. Gearhart &amp; Co., and Samuel Witman, plaintiffs, against John Amsbaugh. It was founded upon a promise of the defendant, endorsed upon a promissory note drawn by one Rodgers in favour of the plaintiffs. The endorsement was in these words:—</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b482-11" data-blocks='[["BL_482.9",482,[299,1101,1172,144]]]'>The defendant proved that the amount of the note could have been collected from Rodgers at any time, from the day when it became due to the day of trial.</p>
