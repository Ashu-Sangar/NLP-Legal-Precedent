The land had been settled and improved by Peter Hartman and son, who had continued the residence from 1770 till 1806, when it was sold to William Starner, who in 1808 sold to Samuel White. In 1794 a part of the claim of Hartman had been surveyed on a warrant to Moses Eoulk, dated 4 March, 1786, and in 1795 another part had been surveyed on a warrant to Thomas Thornburg, dated 1 October, 1792. It did not appear that any objection had been made to these surveys, although they both interfere with what was claimed by the improvement. If the residence had been continued until White obtained his warrant, the board would consider his title as preferable, but as the residence appears to have been discontinued,the board think that this was an abandonment, and, although the title under the warrants of Eoulk and Thornburg could not have affected the claim under the settlement, had the residence been continued — yet, whenever the abandonment took place, we think, the right of these warrants took effect, and having taken effect, the resuming the settlement, or taking a new warrant afterwards, could not do away the right under these warrants. The board, therefore, decide in favour of plaintiffs, and direct a new return to be made on White’s warrant, including only what land lies between the surveys of Eoulk and Thornburg.”</p>

If you are satisfied from the evidence, that Hartman did abandon this part of the land, which he might have embraced in the lines of his. survey under his settlement, then the defendant, who claims under him, could not reassert a right which at one time existed in Hartman, and which he relinquished, so as to defeat the plaintiff’s right to this land under their regular office title exhibited in evidence. On the other hand, if there was no abandonment — no such acquiescence in the location of the Foulk warrant, as the plaintiff contends for — and the defendant and those under whom he claims, have occupied this land, lived upon it and used it in every way necessary to the enjoyment of it as a residence (and for a saw-mill), from 1772 until the application for a warrant in 1814, and survey upon it in 1815, then this location of the warrant would relate back to the original settlement in 1772 or 1770, and be the oldest title, and consequently defeat the plaintiff’s recovery in this action. It may be well to remark in this connexion, as bearing on a portion of the evidence in this cause, that a settler may change the location of his house within his limits of 300 acres, to a point more desirable, and, if he continue to live upon, and exercise acts of ownership over his whole claim, in a way to promote his own interests and preserve his estate, by using a part for agricultural purposes, and keeping the balance for timber, he may do so, and the law will not regard it as an abandonment. Nor will the going away of a tenant who had <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>rented the premises, and leaving the property during the year for which he had leased, be an abandonment by the owner, if the owner reasserted his right by putting another in, or moving on it whenever he had a right to do so, at the end of the year for which he had rented. To constitute an abandonment, the settler must have left the premises with a view not to return, or absented himself so long from them as that the law would presume it. A person leaving his improvement, with an intention not to return to it, creates an abandonment from the time he quits it. Or, if he leaves it, and stays away from it, and neglects it for one or more years, the law would regard it as abandoned, and the premises would be open to location, settlement, or sale by the commonwealth, to any one who chose to take it up in the mode prescribed by law.</p>

Of this, we have already said, you will judge from the whole evidence in the cause. A settler was entitled to 300 acres, he might be satisfied with less, and take less, but without marking his boundaries he was entitled to 300 acres about his improvement in such directions as would be most convenient and necessary to his enjoyment of it, and with this right of the settler, a subsequent warrantee could not interfere without his consent.

He says they were treated as a privilege, granted without consideration, and liable to forfeiture by a relinquishment of the possession, without good cause. It is true, great regard was shown to <em>bond fide </em>settlements by the proprietory agents, and, since their day, by the state; and if prosecuted with due diligence, subsequent warrantees or occupants are not permitted to interfere with them. The right of a settler to perfect his title to three hundred acres, located in a convenient and reasonable shape around his improvement, was always conceded; and any attempt fraudulently to deprive him of this privilege, is frowned upon by the law and its administrators. But he is not bound to take three hundred acres of the public land. He may circumscribe his boundary within a much narrower limit, if he will, and hence it is that a posterior warrant and survey, so located as to hedge him far within the circle to which he might legitimately claim to hold, is not necessarily void, as it would be, were it an interference with an older legal title. It is voidable only at the instance of the improver, for so much land included in the warrant as he might legally cover by virtue of the improvement; and if he relinquish it, by word or deed, or fail to assert it within a reasonable time, the title of the warrant-holder is perfected: Cresson <em>v. </em>Miller, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%20276" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="2 W. 276">2 W. 276</a>, S.

Vigilantibus, <em>et non dormientibus, jura </em>subveniunt, is a maxim applicable to all who seek to perfect an imperfect title, and to none more strictly than to those who assert inchoate titles to land under our system. Yigilance is the price of safety. To it, indolence and carelessness are always postponed. In accordance with this rule, founded in the obvious policy of limiting litigation and quieting estates, it is held, that taking out a warrant or application for land, and procuring a survey, without more, gives no title. If such a warrantee neglects to have the survey returned in due time, he will be postponed to a younger warrant, prosecuted with due diligence: Chambers <em>v. </em>Mifflin, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20P.%20R.%2074" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="1 P.

Shoemaker, 1 W; &amp; S. 166, if was ruled, in analogy to the limitation act of March, 1786, that neglecting to procure a return of survey for seven-years, would work a forfeiture, on the presumption of- abandonment. This has been the rule ever sincé; and'it is-settled that when the question of abahido'nment' arises from mere'lapse'of time, it is a question of law to be decided by the court, irrespective of <em>any intention, entertained by the warrant-holder. </em>When less than seven years have elapsed,- it -becomes a question of intention for a jury, who may establish it, upon circumstances evidencing such intent, though a very brief period may here serve. The rule was applied with great justice in Brentlinger v. Hutchinson, 1 W.52, to one who had been an actual settler, and claimed by an improvement right; “though,” said Kennedy, J., speaking for the court, “in giving this indulgence to an actual séttler, I am far from being perfectly satisfied that it may not be in opposition to the will and intention of the legislature as it has been manifested in their acts on this subject.”- Long before these decisions, it had been adjudged, that abandonment is not, in all cases, a matter of fact, but that it may be a conclusion of law from facts. “Where,” said Duncan, J., in Cluggage v. Duncan, 1 S. &amp; R. 120, “a man makes a settlement, and-leaves'it for a great length of time, it does not signify for him to say, that he keeps up his claim. The law declares, that such -verbal claims have no avail against the act of relinquishing-possession.” The same thing was laid down in Watson v. Gilday, 1 S. &amp; R. 340.</p>

It has its birth in our peculiar system, and has been slowly elaborated by the exigencies presented by-successive contests, springing from antagonistic diligence and indifference.</p>
    <p id="b115-3" data-blocks='[["BL_115.4",115,[142,656,1179,1646]]]'>It is settled that assessment and payment of taxes alone, for an unseated tract of land, will in no degree contribute to the creation of a title. But, under certain circumstances, it will assist to extend the limits of an adverse possession, even to constructive ouster, and it has been held that a refusal to acknowledge a liability to taxation as owner, may operate to defeat a right in favour of another claimant, whose right is doubtful. Thus, though a settler on appropriated lands may not be an avowed intruder, his possession extends no further than his original occupancy, because there is no boundary or anything else to mark its extent. But payment of taxes by him, raises a presumption of ouster of the whole tract, and extends, by construction, the possession to the boundaries of the warrant : M’Call <em>v. </em>Neely, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20W.%2069" class="citation" data-index="29" data-cite="3 W. 69">3 W. 69</a>. And such payment for twenty-one years, with the acquiescence of the owner, will confer a title to the whole survey; for it is regarded as equivalent to claim and adverse possession: M’Caffrey v. Fisher, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20182" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 182">4 W. &amp; S. 182</a>. To suffer this at the hand of an adversary, amounts to a confession :of ouster, for a man may show by his conduct, -as well as by-his declarations, that he considers himself out of possession. The rule holds, too,- when the intruder designates his - claim to part of a tract, by marks - on the ground surveyed,-and- pays .taxes-for it: • Royer v.

The case is not very lucidly reported, but-I gather the claim defeated was set up through one who had, or alleged he had, paid the purchase-money to the commonwealth, and asserted a possession. But it was shown he had refused to be assessed for the land, and knew it was assessed to another, who had paid the taxes for thirty years; This was held tantamount to a confession of disseisin, so as to let in the statute of limitations.</p>
    <p id="b115-4" data-blocks='[["BL_115.5",115,[155,2319,1167,195]],["BL_116.1",116,[338,403,1175,1758]]]'>Now, let us apply the principles brought into view, to the facts of the ease in hand. The first and leading question is, whether those, under whose improvement-right the defendant claims the land in dispute, did, or omitted to do anything by which their claim <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>was circumscribed within the lines designated by the survey of 1794, under the warrant of 1786, in the name of Moses Foulk ? The settlement is said to have been made by Peter Hartman in 1770. There were two or three clearings, but, according to the proof, these were all without the Foulk line. The land settled, appears first to have been assessed in the name of Peter Hartman, in 1776, as one hundred acres; again, in 1799 as fifty acres, which continued down to 1799, when it was returned as one hundred acres, in the name of Henry Hartman, and thus continued, without being increased, until 1817, when it was rated at two hundred and nine acres, and as the property of Samuel White, whose application for a warrant for two hundred acres, including the improvement, was first made in February, 1814. During the greater part of this period, or at least from 1795, the owners of the Foulk survey paid the taxes for the whole tract, cut wood upon it, and treated it as their own, when finally, it was cleared of timber in the year 1820, by Michael Ege, who then claimed it by a legal title derived from Foulk. It was, too, sold in 1795 by Foulk, mortgaged by the vendees in that year, patented by them in the next, and passed under this title, by successive sales and conveyances, until it reached the seisin of the present plaintiff. It is also in proof that the improver was present when the Foulk survey was made, without interposing any objection; that upon a <em>caveat </em>returned by the surveyor under the warrant of Samuel White, the Board of Property decided against White’s right to extend his survey over the Foulk line, and directed a new survey, which was never procured; and, although an ejectment was brought by White against the then owner, Ege, as an appeal from the decision of the board, it was never prosecuted, but suffered to sleep until White was sold out by the sheriff. Finally, it was shown that, without transcending the Foulk line, there is found a sufficient quantity of land to satisfy the whole claim made by the improver, for a period of thirty-eight years, and until after Samuel White had taken out his warrant, when first the idea seems to have been entertained of calling in question the validity of Foulk’s survey and title.</p>
    <p id="b116-3" data-blocks='[["BL_116.4",116,[339,2167,1174,347]],["BL_117.1",117,[98,392,1186,2067]],["BL_118.1",118,[381,398,1165,97]]]'>This is a brief outline of the facts as proved. If believed, they show either that the improver never intended to appropriate to himself, by virtue of his improvement, any of the land lying beyond the Foulk line, but meant to content himself with the smaller quantity returned by him to the assessor; or that he is !aefc« guilty of gross negligence in omitting to assert and perfect his original privilege for a period of upwards of twenty years, during which <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>his antagonists paid -taxes for the disputed tract, whilst he, in effect, disclaimed all liability as owner. Now whether the case be put upon his intention or his negligence, it is equally fatal to the pretension now set up. Had he taken a warrant within a reasonable time, and procured a survey to be made for the portion included by the lines actually run, or marked a consentable line on the ground, he could not afterwards transcend this in default of another warrant and survey: Davis <em>v. </em>Keefer, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Barb.%20163" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="4 Barb. 163">4 B. 163</a>. He would have been definitively bound by such an act, as showing an election to take a lesser quantity than the law would otherwise have accorded to him. Yet this is scarcely stronger than what he did, as indi- . eating a choice. ■ His knowledge of what was done under the Foulk warrant is scarcely to be denied: his long unmurmuring acquiescence in it, in connexion with his positive act of returning a limited number of acres for taxation, can be regarded as little less than a recognition of the established lines. But it is, perhaps, safer and more satisfactory to rest this branch of the case upon the total omission of the settler to locate his 300 acres. Under ascertained principles, this of itself would seem to be sufficient to postpone his equity to the legal title of his antagonist. Thrice the period of time ascertained by our decisions as enough to constitute an abandonment at law by quitting possession, or by neglecting to cause a return of survey, had run after the Foulk survey before any movement made to push the settler’s equity to its verge, and when at last made, it seems to have been almost immediately abandoned, under the rebuke of the Board of Property. The ejectment of 1817 will not serve to rescue the plaintiff’s case from the applicability of this remark, for that was suffered to sleep through a series of years, and, finally, to expire with the expiration of the estate of the party who instituted it. Thus neglect has been added to neglect, by parties whose duty called for at least the exercise of ordinary diligence. But, considered apart from what has been done or omitted since the procurement of the warrant by White, it seems to us, the case of an-actual settler is to be governed by the principles of the adjudications already cited, and settling what degree of neglect amounts to a legal'abandonment, as against a subsequent warrantee. The same policy which calls upon the warrant-holder to cause his survey to be returned into office within a limited period, and upon the settler to renew his actual occupation within the same period, would seem strictly applicable to the latter in the exercise of the privilege, attendant upon his improve<a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>ment of surrounding it <em>by </em>an appropriated number of acres, not exceeding 300.</p>

Should.a case.calling for the application of this principle ever-present itself, it is more than probable the - court, looking to the public interest and to private convenience, will not hesitate to recognise it as a governing rule. There can be no objection urged against extending its embrace where the analogy is so perfect. But its aid is scarcely required in our case. Besides the great lapse of time, here are other circumstances, already alluded to, which, we think, must be esteemed as long since operating to extinguish the settler’s equity, by perfecting the legal title granted by the Commonwealth. Bare <em>non user </em>would, probably, have been found sufficient for the purpose, but this is greatly- assisted by the other facts. - Without recapitulating them, it is sufficient to say they, .'.in' our apprehension, ’ called for the instruction, that-if .the jury believed'.thése. things — rand .there does not appear-to be the slightest room.for.dispute — the.plaintiff’s title is the -best; without-the qualifications, which-..lo.ok to. an; express acquiescence of the-settler in the E.oulk.survey, or t.o.a secret reservation -of-right -to transcend.it., ’ Whether,, after so.many years of inaction and- apparent.acquiesc.ence in’.the .propriety, of. that survey, lie'regarded 'the-lesser number, of.acr.es As. th'e.mxtent, of-his --.claim, in virtue'of- his settlement,,'is matter;of,indifference, 'The..;law concludes him.

The “conditional” line which he says was established between his <a id="p119" href="#p119" data-label="119" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*119</a>father and Adam Olipliver, does not appear to have been esteemed by the court below, as of any value in the determination'of the controversy. Indeed, if the other testimony is worthy o'f; credence, Hartman was entirely mistaken as to the locality of the Olipliver ■ tract, and consequently in error as to the line run to designate its boundary on one side. Perhaps, upon another trial,'the evidence on this point may be made more distinct. What has been said, covers the greater part of the exceptions taken to the charge of the court.</p>
