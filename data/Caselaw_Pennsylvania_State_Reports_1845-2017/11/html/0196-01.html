      <em>June </em>21. This was an application to the court below for a writ of mandamus, based upon a petition signed by Charles Bitchthorn and Andrew M. Dehart, setting forth, that by the 9th section of an act of Assembly, passed March 16, 1847, the select and common councils of the city of Reading were empowered to open and keep open the streets, lanes, and alleys of said city; that there was a street in said city, called South 3d street, which had been long since laid out as a public street, of the width of 60 feet, which street it was the duty of councils to keep open to that width; that they have neglected so to do, suffering a part of the same to be occupied by certain persons, who had encroached with their houses upon the side-walk, thereby occupying and obstructing the side-walk of said street, and rendering it impossible for citizens to use said walk as they should, &amp;c. Upon these representations they prayed the court to grant a rule to show cause why a mandamus should not be issued, directed to said councils, commanding them to open, and keep open said street and side-walk, or to show cause, &amp;c., which <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>rule was made absolute, and an alternative mandamus was awarded, April 20, 1848, and served. Whereupon the said councils, May 16, 1848, filed their answer, asking that the said mandamus might be quashed for the following reasons:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b197-4" data-blocks='[["BL_197.4",197,[145,563,1179,993]]]'>1st. That though it may be true that the erections complained of may exist, yet it is equally true that they existed, and occupied the said side-walk as now, long before September 12, 1788, at which time an act of Assembly was passed, entitled, “ An act for erecting the town of Beading, in Berks county, into a borough, for regulating the buildings, preventing nuisances and encroachments on the squares, streets, lanes, and alleys of the same, &amp;c.” By the 12th section of which, it is enacted as follows: “And for the better preventing all encroachments, nuisances, contentions, annoyances, and inconveniences whatever, within the bounds and limits of the said borough, it is enacted, that when any buildings have been erected heretofore within the original plan of said borough (other than such as have been erected unjustly on the out-lots), and shall happen to encroach on any of the said streets and alleys, or squares, such buildings shall not be deemed, taken, or held for nuisances, or abateable as such” — that the said buildings having been erected before the passage of the said act, and within the original plan of the borough, and being, by said act, legalized in their erection and encroachment on said street, it was not the duty of councils to remove the same.</p>

The corporation of Reading has no power, nor is it its duty, and therefore it cannot be compelled to open streets in Reading, except when directed by the Court of Quarter Sessions, according to the 4th section of the act of Assembly: Pamph. L. 1825-6, p. 115. Here there was no such direction. The corporation derives its power from its charter, by the 9th section of which (see P. L. of 1847, p. 412), it is given, “ all the powers now vested in the borough of Reading.” By the 6th section of the act of March 29,1813, its powers are defined — “improving, repairing, cleansing, and keeping in order the streets, &amp;c.” These words cannot be so enlarged as to give the corporation the power of opening. Powers of Quarter- Sessions strictly construed: so should it be with corporations. The Court of Quarter Sessions of Berts county, under the general road law, has no authority to widen Liberty alley into a fifty feet street, nor has it under the act of 1825, P. L. 115, §§ 2, 3,4, for the- better regulation of the borough of Reading, which authorized the court to grant views for opening or extending any street,' lane, or alley in said borough, any such powers: <em>In re </em>Liberty Alley, 8 Barr, 381. Under the general road law, the Quarter Sessions has no jurisdiction to lay out and open streets and alleys, on the site of streets and alleys laid out by the original proprietor of an incorporated borough, in the plan of the town, which have not been opened: <em>In re </em>Milford, 4 Barr, 303. Under road law, Quarter Sessions cannot widen: Church Road Case, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 200" data-case-ids="478820" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0200-01">5 W. &amp; S. 200</a>.</p>

A mandamus, though a prerogative writ and demandable of right in a proper case, is justly said to be grantable at discretion. Hence it is that it is to be invoked only in cases of the last necessity: not where there is another effectual remedy. The principle is a clear one, and abundantly sustained, not only by the English authorities, but by the decisions of this court. Is there not then a specific remedy equally potent to which these relators might resort ? True, it was said <em>arguendo, </em>and sanctioned by the court in The King <em>v. </em>The Commissioners of Dean Inclosure, 2 Maule &amp; Selw. 83, that an “ indictment is only a proceeding <em>in pcenam, </em>and not a remedy for the future.” That was a prosecution for disobedience of an order of the Sessions to set out a public road: but it was held in Rex v. Pappineau, 1 Stra. 686, that a part of the proper sentence for a <em>continuing </em>nuisance, is that the defendant stand committed till he abate it at his proper costs; and such was the sentence in The King <em>v. </em>Incledon, 13 East, 167, and The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>M’Donald, 16 S. &amp; R. 402. The offence might indeed be pardoned, and the remedial part of the sentence frustrated; but that done, it would be a question whether a mandamus ought not then to be allowed. It is not to be presumed in the first instance, however, that more than the fine and imprisonment would be remitted, or that the nuisance would be suffered to stand to the injury of the public. The nuisance, in this case, is a public one, and it does not appear from the statement of the relators, that they have received any special injury from it to entitle them to any civil remedy whatever. The obstruction of the side-walk is not more injurious to them than it is to the inhabitants at large; and it would consequently seem that an indictment is exclusively the means to abate it. It is proper to add that the act of 1783, legalizing, for the time being, erections in that borough — these among the rest— which were then nuisances, was no more than a license for their continuance, dependent on the will of the legislature, and consequently revocable at its pleasure. Nothing was done or suffered as a consideration of the license which, as it did not partake of the nature of a contract in any respect, it was competent for the legislature to withdraw.</p>
