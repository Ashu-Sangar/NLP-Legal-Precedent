      <em>Sept. </em>29. This was an action on the case, with a count in trover, brought by Keymborg &amp; Co. against Burbridge &amp; Co. The case was tried upon the count in trover, and the effort was to recover the value of certain packages of segars, sent by the plaintiffs to one Bollman to be sold on commission.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b535-7" data-blocks='[["BL_535.7",535,[156,1057,1183,1189]]]'>On the trial, Bollman was offered by the plaintiffs as a witness, and objected to by the defendants on the ground of interest. He was, however, permitted to testify, the court reserving the question. He testified as <em>follows: </em>— “ One of the plaintiffs came to me to take segars on commission. He sent 8 M. 32 qr. boxes. I was then indebted to defendants, and was not able to pay them; I gave the segars to the defendants, limiting them at $8 per thousand, to sell to pay themselves; defendants complained that the segars were not worth the money, and could not sell them. I wrote to plaintiffs about it; they said they had another kind, about 20 M., that they could send; I told Mr. Burbridge; they sent me 21 M. I handed the bill of lading to Mr. Burbridge; he received them and paid the freight for them. These were limited at $ 10 per thousand. I asked Mr. Burbridge if I should write on for them before I did do so. I thought I might sell them to anybody. I did not tell him how I got them. B. complained of these; I <em>told him I </em>would write to reduce the limit; I did write; no reduction; informed B. of this. When I gave them to B. I limited the price. Got the last parcel in 1842; B. afterwards sold them on an execution against me. The next summer or fall, one of plaintiffs was here, and the segars were yet in B.’s hands; he complained to me of the limit; plaintiffs said they should not be sold for less. In the spring of 1844 plaintiff ivas here and demanded the segars from the defendants; refused.”</p>

A verdict AAras taken for the plaintiff, subject to a judgment <em>non obstante </em>upon the reserved question. Subsequently the court (Loavrie, J.) disposed of this reserved question in the following opinion:—</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b536-3" data-blocks='[["BL_536.4",536,[315,468,1174,392]]]'>“ The goods in question were sent to him by the plaintiffs to sell on commission. He transferred them to defendants, to be sold by them at a limited price in payment of a judgment in their favour against him. The goods not being saleable at the limit, after some time the defendants issued execution on their judgment, had the goods sold, and became themselves the purchasers for the sum of $180. The plaintiffs now claim the goods, and offer Bollman as a witness to prove their title.</p>
