The granting of letters to Jonathan Bieber in the first instance, on the 18th of May, so soon after the death of the decedent, not, it would appear, upon the <em>then </em>nomination of the greater or indeed of any part of the heirs, and without notice to them, or particularly to the complainant here, was certainly precipitate. When a stranger presents himself and asks for letters to the exclusion of kindred of the decedent, and does not produce the written renunciation of those preferred by law, letters should not be granted to him without bringing those so preferred before the Register by citation or other adequate notice, in order that they may contest or acquiesce in the grant. Administration' does not belong to the first claimant. But the Register having once granted administration, the power to revoke it seems to be lodged only with the Register’s Court, upon appeal from the judicial acts and decisions of the Register, of which granting administration constitutes so large a class; and that court, upon appeal, is invested with power to affirm, revoke, alter or modify the decree of the Register.

An executor has a right to probate, though it has already been taken out by his co-executor.

The interests of these children of the decedent in the estate are all equal, and we have here the eldest son, representing an interest equal to one-sixth, resisted in his claims to the administration by the others, representing interests equal, or very nearly equal, to five-sixths of the estate. In the English courts, it is said, when there is no material objection on the one hand or reasons for preference on the other, the court in its discretion puts the administration into the hands of that person, amongst those of the same degree of kindred, with whom the majority of parties interested is desirous of intrusting the estate. Without examining the extent of the applicability of this rule in our practice, we will say that the preference of a majority in interest will always be favourably regarded, when the court can properly do so, and that where claims are equally balanced it will be decisive.</p>

It seems to us that this state- of facts presents an insuperable objection to the appointment of Isaac. He stands in an antagonist position to the interest of all the other heirs, so far as three-fourths of the estate are concerned, and granting administration to him, would amount to a suspension of all proceedings to determine the validity of that debt during the continuance of his administration.

They commenced on the 28th July, 1847, when a citation was issued to both Isaac and Jonathan, and the contest was fully heard on the 18th February, 1848, before a Register’s Court. Witnesses were examined; and all the children of the deceased, except Isaac, filed a written protest against the continuance of Isaac as administrator, alleging that he resided out of the county, and that he was largly indebted to the estate, which indebtedness he denied, for the purpose of depriving the other heirs of their share of the estate, and declaring their satisfaction and approval of Jonathan. In the inventory filed by Jonathan, a claim is made against Isaac, of $640. The whole inventory amounted to $859.72. The inventory filed by Isaac, amounted to the sum of $140. There were five heirs of the deceased, who all resided in Berks county, except Isaac. The Register’s Court were of opinion that the power of the Register was at an end, when he had granted the first letters of administration.

It was further held in that case, that the right of one Swartzwelder was properly rejected on the ground of expediency. The objection is insurmountable when he stands as a litigant party in opposition to the other heirs. Courts have constantly declined putting in persons as administrators so situated. This is a strong case. Here Isaac was already in possession of more than half the estate. It is said he claimed it as a gift from his mother. This position rendered him an incompetent person to perform the duties of the office of administrator, which is one of trust and confidence, and ought to he committed to a person who has no interest in opposition to the other heirs of the estate.</p>
