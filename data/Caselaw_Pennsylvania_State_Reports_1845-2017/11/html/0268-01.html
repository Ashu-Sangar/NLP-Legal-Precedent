      <em>July </em>26. One Nathan Mitchill executed a mortgage to Platt Knox, to secure the payment of $2,626. On the 11th January,-1848, Platt Knox assigned the mortgage to his brother, A. P. Knox.

That the note was paid to him by A. P. Knox. This was done at his house in the town of Rhinebeck. The sole object of notice is to give the adverse party an opportunity of testing the accuracy of the facts sworn to, by inquiries made at the place and about the time when they transpired.
