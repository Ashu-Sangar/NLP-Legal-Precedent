On the same day Cash bid off this tract at the commissioners’ sale, and on the 23d December, 1834, the commissioners executed a deed to him. On the 15th March, 1837, Charles Barclay, the former owner, instituted a suit in ejectment against Cash for this land. Cash wrote to Eox informing him of this suit, and in various letters recognised his right in this land. In one of these letters he asked Eox to agree to pay the whole of the counsel fees in the suit, which brought from Eox an angry letter in reply, in which he offered to abandon his whole claim to Mr. Cash if he would discharge him from his obligation to pay him one-half of the expenses, and he also stated that he had given him, according to his own letters, full power to do as he pleased with the suit, or abandon the claim to the land. Mr. Cash took no notice of this letter, and Mr. Eox heard nothing more of the matter for many years, being absent from the county. He accidentally learned that Cash had compromised the suit, and sold the land to Samuel Rhoades, Jr., the agent of Barclay, for $1,000, and that by deed of 29th October, 1840, recorded 7th Hovember, 1840, he had conveyed the same to him. This suit was brought by Fox on the 30th April, 1847, and is an action on the case in <em>assumpsit </em>for money had and received. The plaintiff set out in his declaration the agreement and the subsequent purchase by and deed to Cash — that he then held the one half in trust for the plaintiff; that he sold the same, as well his own right as the right of the plaintiff, and received the purchase-money; that he neglected to give notice to plaintiff of such sale. The defendant set up as a defence: 1. That the plaintiff abandoned his claim to Cash. 2. That the contract was not executed, and was against the policy of the law. And 3. That the plaintiff’s claim is barred by the statute of limitations. The court below (Cohyngham, President) negatived the first, and sustained the second and third grounds of defence. The verdict was for the defendant. The errors assigned here <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>covered the instruction of the court upon the second and third grounds of defence.</p>
