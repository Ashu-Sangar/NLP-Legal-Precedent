      <em>July </em>23. This was an action of ejectment, in which William Byers was the plaintiff, and Jonathan Hoch was the defendant. The following facts, by the agreement of the parties, were con- ’ sidered in the nature of a special .verdict:—</p>

A <em>fi. fa. </em>No. 27, December Term, 1845, was issued on said judgment, and levied on the property in dispute, and the same was condemned. A <em>ven. ex. </em>No. 25, February Term, 1846, was issued on the same, by virtue whereof the property in dispute was sold to Daniel Hunsicker, and a deed duly made, acknowledged therefor to him by the sheriff on the 27th February, 1847.

Act of April 6, 1830; Dunlop’s Dig. 441. This act does not plainly express the object of the legislature: Green <em>v. </em>Thompson, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20419" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts 419">7 Watts, 419</a>; Berger <em>v. </em>Hiester, <a href="/whart/6/0210-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Whart. 210" data-case-ids="1836995" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0210-01">6 Wharton, 210</a>. That was to allow no more than- the equity of redemption, to be sold on execution against the mortgagee : Kuhn’s Appeal, 2 Barr, 265; Presbyterian Corporation <em>v. </em>Wallace, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Rawle%20131" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Rawle 131">3 Rawle, 131</a>. This case is precisely like Willard <em>v. </em>Norris, <a href="/rawle/2/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Rawle 56" data-case-ids="1820579" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0056-01">2 Rawle, 56</a>, which induced the legislature to change the law and pass the act of 6th April, 1830. A prior mortgage would not have divested the lien of the mortgage to Chandler; but the reason for divesting it in that case is stronger than in the present. A prior mortgage, taking the freehold, leaves only an equity of redemption for the second mortgage — a judgment leaves the freehold to the subsequent mortgage.</p>

The subsequent judgment-creditor being able to sell nothing more than the equity of redemption remaining in the mortgagee, can of course not affect the interest of the prior judgment-creditor, according to the case of Tower’s Appropriation, 9 W. &amp; S. (see opinion of Chief Justice, 104). But, if the construction put upon the act by the court below be correct, then, if a man has half-a-dozen tracts of land, and give a mortgage on one only, a subsequent judgment-creditor may sell that one tract, the prior judgments take all the proceeds, the mortgage get no<a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>thing, and the remaining tracts may still be sufficient to satisfy all the judgments before and after the mortgage.</p>
