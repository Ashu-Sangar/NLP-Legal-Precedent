Paxton, George Hughes, and George W.

    <p id="b360-4" data-blocks='[["BL_360.4",360,[310,617,1177,1099]]]'>The first question in order, that the case presents is, whether this is such a road as comes within the provisions of the road law before recited ? We think it is not. Hence, the whole proceedings are irregular and void. It is not a road upon and along the division line of the counties. It is a road part in Northumberland and part in Columbia county. It is in no part upon and along the line of the counties. It does not come within the 26th section of the general road law, the only part of the general road law that relates to this case. The roads contemplated to be laid out, as this road was, under the 26th section before recited, are roads laid out on the division line between the counties, the half of the breadth of the road in each county. The line of the counties is the centre of the road. Although this case does not require it, there is another error on which I will express an opinion. The authority of viewers is derived from the road law, and from the order issued by the Sessions in pursuance of the law. The order from the Sessions of Columbia county, under the seal of the court, to three viewers appointed in that county, paid no regard to the 26th section of the road law. It took no notice of the joint proceedings which that section directs, nor that the viewers were to act in conjunction with the viewers appointed by Northumberland, nor of the proceedings in Northumberland.</p>
