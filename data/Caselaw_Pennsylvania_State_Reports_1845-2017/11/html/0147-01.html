      <em>June 15. </em>Adam Rineman, the plaintiff below, brought suit before a justice, against the Commissioners of Franklin, to recover the price of printing certain election proclamations in a German newspaper, published by him in the county, called the “ Coon Fanger,” or Coon Killer. From the judgment of the justice there was an appeal, upon the trial of which it appeared that the sheriff of the county had employed Rineman to do this printing; that the paper was what is called a campaign paper, having been published but for three months preceding the presidential election of 1844, and that it was a newspaper in fact and in form, regularly published in the county, and circulating some 300 numbers weekly.</p>

There is no law that forbids it, and the general rule of law and justice is that where it is the right and duty of an officer to employ a man in the public service, and such officer does so employ him, the public, and not the officer, is bound to pay him for the service.</p>

The fee bill of 1821, under the title “ Sheriff,” has this item: — “Advertising general election, in addition to the printer’s bill, to be paid by the county, 75 cents.” The labour and services were done by the printer. The county is to pay for it by the express direction of the act: Dunlop, 298. No good reason can be given for the printer’s bill passing through the hands of the sheriff. But it is alleged this enactment in the fee bill of 1821 is superseded by the act of the 13th April, 1840: Dunlop, 803. The 8th section of that act, relied upon to sustain this position, relates to publications by order of the court in contests before them. These publications are for the benefit of, and to give information to, the people, and are made by express enactment of the legislature.</p>

It is next objected, that the “ Coon ICiller” is not a newspaper within the meaning of the law; and that the publication in it was an evasion of the act of the legislature. The paper was before the jury. The only witness examined on that point, stated it was a newspaper. It is certainly not what is usually called a handbill, because a handbill is only printed on one side, and the Coon Killer is printed all over in German. I regret that I am not able to read it. It is produced to us here, and is about the size of the good old “ Pennsylvania Gazette,” started in Philadelphia by Kremer, in 1728, afterwards owned and edited by Dr. Franklin, subsequently by Hall &amp; Sellers, in 1776, and a paper sought after, not only over the continent of North America, but over the civilized world. It is certainly a newspaper; 'but whether it was of the right politics, in advocating the election of the candidate of this or that party, is not the subject of error in this court.</p>

The legislature, by the act of the 15th April, 1834 (Dunlop, 566), makes each county within the Commonwealth a body corporate. Prior to the passage of this act, it was the universal practice in all actions for or against counties, to institute them in the name of the commissioners. But this action was commenced before a justice of the peace; and, as it was the duty of the Common Pleas to amend the form of the action, they had a right to strike out the names of the commissioners and let the action remain against the county of Franklin: Caldwell <em>v. </em>Thompson, <a href="/rawle/1/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="1 Rawle 370" data-case-ids="1819235" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0370-01">1 Rawle, 370</a>; Lyon <em>v. </em>Chalker, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20W.%2014" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 W. 14">2 W. 14</a>, 173; Esher v. Flagler, 17 S. &amp; R. 141. And we presume this was done because the statement of the demand is filed against the county. The county pleaded to issue, and the cause was tried on its merits.</p>
