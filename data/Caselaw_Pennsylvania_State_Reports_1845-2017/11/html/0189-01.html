Anna was the daughter and only child of John; she also lived on this land; was married and died three months afterwards, childless, in July 1820, being at her death more than twenty-one years of age. When Anna was married, she left the land and did not return to it. The testator’s daughter, Barbara, lived on land adjoining; she never married, and died in August 1825; Jacob Zook, the nephew, lived with her. This Jacob is a son of Anna Zook ■ deceased, a daughter of the testator, one of her six children; and from him the plaintiff, David Mast, derived his title by a deed, dated 29th March, 1844. The widow of the testator’s son John died in July 1839. The defendants were in possession at the bringing of the suit.</p>

They paid taxes for it. The widow lived on the land from 1802 until her death, in July 1839, since which time the defendant, John Long, kept up the possession by his tenants. The defendant also gave in evidence the will of the widow, proved some four years after her death, by which she devised all her property to her son, the defendant.</p>

Christina Long held and possessed in her own right, under the will of Christian Long, until her daughter Anna attained the age of twenty-one years. After that she held adversely to Anna, if her possession can, under the circumstances, be regarded as adverse; for it is proved by Jacob Ochs, that she always claimed a life-estate in this land, in the lifetime of <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>Anna. After the death of Anna, the possession of Christina Long remained as before, the persons entitled by law to the possession being Barbara Long and the children of Anna Zook, until Barbara’s death, when the right of possession descended with the property to the children of Anna Zook. Anna, the daughter of John Long, who was living at the date of Christian Long’s will, in 1796, must have been at age at least as early as 1817; and Christina Long ha'ving lived on the land until 1839, when she died in possession, her title was complete under the statute of limitations, if her possession were such as to give title under that statute, and it would be competent for John Long to defend his possession against the plaintiff, under the title of Christina thus acquired. Was the possession of Christina Long of the character which the law recognises as capable of conferring title under the statute? Was it adverse possession ? We think her possession was in subordination to the title of her daughter Anna Long, until Anna attained the age of twenty-one years, and that being thus in privity with the title of the rightful owner, it is necessary for her and those claiming under her, to show that the character of her possession was changed subsequently to that period, and became hostile to the owner, by some unequivocal act or acts, different from the mere occupation and cultivation of the land, as she had theretofore occupied and cultivated it, or by an open and explicit disavowal and disclaimer of holding under that title, and an assertion of title in herself, communicated to those having title and the right of possession. Whether any such acts or such disavowal and disclaimer have been established by the evidence laid before the court and jury, is for your decision, with the other questions of fact which have arisen in the cause. It is in evidence that Christina Long declared that, as long as she lived, she had a right to it; but it does not appear that this declaration was ever communicated to any person whose rights or interests could be affected by it. In the opinion of the court, such a declaration on the part of Christina Long, even if communicated to those interested in disputing it, does not amount to an assertion of any title, that can be acquired under the statute of limitations, and that it is of itself such a qualification of her possession as would prevent her from acquiring title under it. It is easy to imagine many reasons which might induce a party having title, and the right of possession, to abstain from the immediate prosecution of it, against a person claiming to hold for life merely, which would have no weight in a case where the tenant made no such qualification of his claim or possessions.

Whenever the person in possession holds for himself, to the exclusion of all others, the possession thus held is adverse to all others, no matter in what relation in point of interest or privity he may stand as to others : 5 Peters, 440. Where acts of ownership have been done on land, which, from their nature, indicate a notorious claim of property in it, and are continued for twenty-one years, with the knowledge of an adverse claim and without interruption, or an adverse entry for twenty-one years, such acts are evidence of an ouster and an actual adverse possession: 11 Peters, 52. At the time Anna died, the plaintiff had a perfect right of entry; and, having taken no steps to enforce his right for twenty-one years, his right is barred: Scott <em>v. </em>Gallagher, 14 S. &amp; R. 336. If one tenant in common of land enters on the whole, and takes the profits of the whole for twenty-one years, claiming the whole exclusively, an ouster ought to be presumed: Frederick <em>v. </em>Gray, 10 S. &amp; R. 188; Bolton <em>v. </em>Hamilton, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20299" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 299">2 W. &amp; S. 299</a>, 307. An undisturbed and quiet possession for a certain length of time is sufficient ground for the jury to presume an ouster: Law <em>v. </em>Patterson, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20191" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 191">1 W. &amp; S. 191</a>-3. A person in possession claiming the land as his own for twenty-one years, is completely protected by the statute: Leeds <em>v. </em>Bender, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20318" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 318">6 W. &amp; S. 318</a>. It is not necessary that there should be a declaration, that possession was held adversely. Facts may establish this as conclusively as a formal declaration: Dikeman <em>v. </em>Parrish, 6 Barr, 225. The character of adverse possession is given, not by proving notice to those interested, but by the nature of the acts done by the party: 6 Barr, 227; <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20318" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 318">6 W. &amp; S. 318</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20191" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 191">1 W. &amp; S. 191</a>. Leasing, conveying, or devising lands, improving them, receiving the rents, issues, and profits thereof, are the highest acts of ownership which can be exercised over them, and the exercise of these acts strongly characterizes the possession with exclusiveness and hostility: Dikeman <em>v. </em>Parrish, 6 Barr, 211. The possession of land qualified for a time by the official character of the possessor for a period of twenty-one years, is a bar to a recovery by one who has otherwise the legal title. And it is not essential to the character of adverse possession, that it be by claim of right in the occupant: Parker <em>v. </em>Southwick, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20W.%20377" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="6 W. 377">6 W. 377</a>. The occupancy of land by one with the knowledge of the owner and his permitting him to pay the taxes for twenty-one years, is equivalent to a confession of ouster by such owner: Sorber <em>v. </em>Willing, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20W.%20142" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="10 W. 142">10 W. 142</a>. When the purchaser from one of several trustees for <a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>life took possession, the statute runs from that time against the whole estate, and twenty-one years of adverse possession bars as well the trustee as the <em>cestui que trust </em>tenant for life, and those in remainder: Smilie <em>v. </em>Biffle, 2 Barr, 52.</p>

After Anna became of age Christina held as tenant by sufferance; she came into possession by lawful title, and kept it afterwards without any title at all, except the permission of the owners. Anna left the property in 1820, and died a few months afterwards, on the 19th July, 1820. The fee then went to the heirs of Christian Long, viz. Barbara and the Zooks.
