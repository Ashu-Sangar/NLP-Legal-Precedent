      <em>July </em>26. The action in the court below was trover and conversion, brought by Henry Heitzman against Bastían Divi'I, William Speese, and John Speese, to recover damages for taking away and converting to their own use a stack of grain.</p>

It seemed 'that he was a tenant of Daniel Rangier, and on his land raised the grain; he became indebted to Rangier to a considerable amount; Rangier sued him, but before he could get judgment, Bastían Divil and his brother John went to a justice of the peace, and Bastían confessed judgment in favour of1 his brother John for $85; they immediately took out execution and took it to the constable. The constable levied by virtue of that execution, on all Bastian’s personal property, except such as was exempt by law, including the stack of grain, advertised and sold it. The greater part of the property, including the stack of grain, was purchased by John, and left in the possession of his brother Bastían. John then gave notice in the “Miltonian” that he had loaned said property, including the stack of grain, during his pleasure, to his brother Bastían. Rangier, after he obtained judgment against Bastían, took out an execution and placed it in the hands of a constable, who levied on said stack of grain, it not having been removed, advertised and sold it, and Henry Heitzman became the purchaser1. After the purchase by Heitzman it was hauled by Bastían, with the team of Speese, to the barn of the latter and threshed. One of the witnesses proved that he asked Wm. Speese to lot him take the grain away from his barn, who replied that he could not let him do so, it did not belong to him, but to Divil. Heitzman asked Speese if he harboured the grain, he said <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>lie did, it was his own barn, and he could harbour anybody’s grain he pleased.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b265-4" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[129,477,1170,388]]]'>During the trial John Divil was offered as a witness on part of' defendants; he was objected to, but admitted by the court. It was contended by the plaintiff that the judgment confessed by Bastian to John Divil, was fraudulent and void as to Rangler’s judgment; that John Divil could not be a witness, as he was interested; and that the loaning of the stack of grain by John, after his purchase, to Bastian, made it the property of the latter, even if the sale on the first execution was valid.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b265-5" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[130,880,1171,295]]]'>The court was requested to charge the jury: 1. That if the jury believe, from the evidence, that John Divil loaned the stacks of grain in controversy to Bastian Divil, then it was liable to be again taken in execution, and sold as the property of Bastian Divil; and that the fact of it being so loaned is clearly established by the advertisement given in evidence by defendants.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b265-6" data-blocks='[["BL_265.6",265,[129,1182,1177,1244]]]'>Answer of the court (Wilson, <em>President). </em>— “ If you are satisfied, from the evidence, that the loan was made of this grain to Bastian for consumption, by John, and the same grain was to be returned in kind, and not the same property, or was to be paid for, the borrower acquires a title in the thing loaned for consumption: property loaned where the same article is to be returned, is clearly distinguishable. If you find that the loan of this grain was unto Bastian for his own consumption, and the same grain was not to be returned to John, the law applicable tout is as here stated. But if the grain was merely left in the possession of Bastian until John could get it away, that he could do without subjecting it to executions against Bastian. You will see the notice given by John in the Miltonian, and you will determine the character of the loan. The property may be left in the possession of the defendant i'n the execution, without the purchaser’s title being affected by it. The purchaser may leave it with the defendant to thresh it out and to dispose of it for him, and it becomes a question of fact for you to determine how the property was left. If intended for defendant’s own use and consumption, when left with- him by the purchaser, without limit, an interest would immediately vest; but if merely left there with the defendant in the execution, without any agreement that Bastian was to have it for his own use and consumption, it would vest no title, and his so loaning it would of itself be no evidence of fraud; how the transaction was, is for you to determine.”</p>

The material question presented for our consideration is: Was John Divil a competent witness in this action ? Bastían was the bailee of John. Bailment is founded on a contract, express or implied. The loan by John to his brother Bastían, falls under Sir William Jones’s 3d class, <em>Qommodatum, </em>or loan for use without pay: Jones on Bailments, 36; Ib. 117.

The grain was John’s. If his allegations were true, it was his property; Bastían held it at the pleasure of John, as his bailee. This is putting the case in the most favourable point of view for the Divils; for if the first Sale was fraudulent, or if there was an absolute gift by John to Bastían, then the second sale would have been legal and enabled the plaintiff to recover. John was clearly interested in the subject of the suit, and I think in the second he was maintaining his own right and title to the grain, and if John had to bring a suit against Bastían when he chose to demand the grain, this judgment could be used by. <em>waf </em>of inducement, or to establish a collateral fact, like the record of a conviction, to show the legal infamy of a witness, or to let in proof what was sworn at the trial: 1 Greenleaf’s Ev. § 527.
