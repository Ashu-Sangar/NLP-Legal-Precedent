The description is limited throughout to his property; and has he any property in Ms wife’s legacy ? If he had even a qualified property, it would pass subject to the wife’s right of survivorship in case it were not recovered in her lifetime. But it was held in Dennison <em>v. </em>Nigh, <a href="/watts/2/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Watts 90" data-case-ids="1840159" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0090-01">2 Watts, 90</a>; and Robinson <em>v. </em>Woelpper, <a href="/whart/1/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Whart. 179" data-case-ids="1829038" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0179-01">1 Whart. 179</a>, that he has not; and that her legacy is not liable to attachment for Ms debt.

In Richwine <em>v. </em>Heim, 1 Penna. Rep. 373, the assignment expressly included the wife’s legacy, which differs that case from the present. The point that the husband has barely a naked power over his wife’s choses in action, and one which he is not bound to execute in favour of Ms creditors, must therefore be taken to be at rest.</p>
