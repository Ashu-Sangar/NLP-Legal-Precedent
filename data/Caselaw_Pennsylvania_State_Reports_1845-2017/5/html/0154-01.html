      <em>April </em>5. This was an action against the sheriff for seizing and selling the personal property of the plaintiff. The defendant pleaded specially that the goods were not the property of the plaintiff, but of one Green; and that beforé the seizure, &amp;c., said Green had made an assignment of all his goods, &amp;c., in trust for his ere? ditors; that plaintiff claimed title under colour of a gift, by the <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>wife of said Green, which was in fraud of his creditors'; and that defendant seized the goods by the authority -of the assignee being the lawful owner.</p>

It appeared that the plaintiff’s mother had a school in Kentucky, and desired the plaintiff to acquire the art of making shell-work vases, and work up some patterns, that she might become qualified to instruct others, for which purpose she sent her money. Before the plaintiff had completed the design, she left the country, and handed over the materials and unfinished work to her sister, the wife of Green, who continued to receive instructions and prepare patterns with money furnished in part by her mother, and partly by her husband. These patterns were made up into two Vases, which were the property in question. After Green’s assignment, and many ineffectual attempts to sell them to pay her own debts, Mrs. Green presented them to the plaintiff.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b155-5" data-blocks='[["BL_155.5",155,[171,1268,1165,193]]]'>Green proved that there was an express understanding with the assignee that these vases were not included in the assignment, as they were the property of his wife, being connected with the school, and her mother having aided her in procuring them.</p>

He cannot be permitted to act professedly in his character of sheriff, and ostensibly by virtue of an execution against A., at the suit of B., and after thus effecting his purpose, throw off his official character, and aver that he took the property as belonging to C., and as the private agent of the real owner. To permit this would' be to expose the possession by the party of a contested chattel, (which the law regards as an advantage,) to be changed and transferred to his antagonist, by the interference of any sheriff or constable, who, by a prostitution of his official power, and in the practice of a falsehood, might choose to lend himself to the execution of such a scheme. This would soon be felt as intolerable. A practice like this would be a fraud on the process of the law, such as the law will not permit. But from the evidence, the fact is clear that the sheriff, or his deputy, did not, in this instance, participate in such a transaction. 'In making the.levy and sale, he did not act as the agent of the assignee of Green. Mr. Pennypacker, (the assignee,) says, that in giving his directions touching the execution of the writ in his hands, he had to do but with the deputy sheriff; and the latter testified that he acted throughout in his capacity of deputy sheriff, and in no other character. This is further shown ■ by the written evidence of levy, and the return endorsed on the writ. Now this execution issued at the suit of Miles <em>v. </em>Sarah Fales. It is not now pretended she had any property in the goods in question.

Green had the right, notwithstanding the general terms of his assignment, so to except them, as he was entitled-to give, not only the law of the trust, but to designate the property, which should be the subject of it. I repeat, therefore, if there was an agreement and understanding between assignor and assignee, before and at the time of the assignment, that those vases should not-pass to the assignee, they did not so pass. Of this there is some evidence for your consideration.</p>

Now in this case we have the fact that the creation of the chattels in question was commenced under the auspices and direction of Mrs. Green’s mother, and at her expense; that the original object having failed, the mother relinquished to the daughter all interest "she might have in them; and I think, the proof is strong from the husband, that he always assented to it, and considered this property as the property of his wife.</p>
