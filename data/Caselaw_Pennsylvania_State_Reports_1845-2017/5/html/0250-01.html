But the form was taken from those in use before the act of 1836, under the provision in the constitution of 1798; and it is to be observed the present statute does not set forth a form <em>in hcec verla, </em>but merely directs a security for the faithful performance of the trust and for duly accounting; act June 13, 1836, sect. 15. In this respect it differs from administration bonds, and the declarations of <em>femes covert </em>in partition, and is clearly within the rule laid down in United States <em>v. </em>Brown, Gilp. 179. The conditions here are not greater than the duties prescribed by the statute. That he shall take care of the person and manage the estate, is required by sects. 14, 20': that he shall account whenever the judges order, by sect. 40; and this bond being taken under their authority, amounted to an order for an annual account: the payment over on cessation of the disability, is directed by sect. 41: that for compliance with the decrees is under sect. 43. Since then, there is no greater liability imposed than the law required; there can be no objection by the surety; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Laub, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 261" data-case-ids="1852630" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0261-01">1 Watts &amp; Serg. 261</a>; Farmers’ Bank <em>v. </em>Boyer, <a href="/serg-rawl/16/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="16 Serg. &amp; Rawle 48" data-case-ids="1816681" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/16/0048-01">16 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 48</a>.

Is there any thing in the condition that the statute does not authorize ? _ We must bear in mind that the statute does not prescribe the form, and make the bond void; unless that form is pursued. The leading principle on this subject, which runs through the cases, is, that when a statute only directs the'condition of the bond, and does not avoid it if it should not conform to the directions, and something more than the condition is added to it, the bond may be allowed to cover the authorized part of the condition; Gilpin’s Rep. 179. 1</p>

We are unable to discover that the bond requires more than this, or that the bond increases the trustee’s responsibility. The law places the person and estate of the lunatic in the custody and care.of the trustee. The bond requires the trustee to account annually during the continuance of the lunacy, and this is the strong ground urged on behalf of the defendant. The 40th section of the act says, it shall be at least once in three years, and at any other time when the court require it. When the mind of the lunatic is restored, the trustee is to pay over the estate in his hands. The 41st section provides that every committee shall, on the determination of his trust, settle it in the office, and the common law would compel him to pay it over when he was discharged by the court, and this would be enforced by every court when the lunatic became <em>compos mentis.</em>
