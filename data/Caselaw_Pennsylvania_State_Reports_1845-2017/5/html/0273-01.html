      <em>May </em>20. On the 10th May, 1834, Jacob Houck made his will, in which, after various devises and legacies, he directed “ that after the decease of his wife the remaining part of his real estate should be sold, and out of the moneys arising from the sale, $200 should be paid to his younger son Johnson, and as to the remaining part of the moneys arising from the sale of his real estate, he willed, after his executor had received compensation for his trouble, the residue should be divided into five equal parts,” one of which he gave to said Johnson, and the other four to his four daughters; and appointed his son Samuel executor. After the death of the testator’s widow, Johnson Houck, the legatee, filed a petition in the Orphan’s Court, setting out these facts, and that the executor had not authority under the will to make sale of the land, and was not willing to apply to the court for authority, and prayed an order on the executor to sell under the act of Assembly.</p>

The statute authorizes such an order when a power over real estate is given generally, and not to any person in particular, “byname or by description,” and this testator devised that the remaining part of his real estate, after testamentary dispositions of certain parts of it, should be sold; so that, <em>prima </em>facie, the case is within the purview. But he subsequently directed, that the remaining part of the moneys arising from the sale of his real estate, after the executor should have received compensation for his trouble, should he divided among persons particularly named; and hence it might be inferred that he had in view the executor’s trouble in selling the real estate. But as the power of the court over the subject is a wholesome one, it ought not to be restrained by circumstances of mere implication, especially when the statute requires a designation by name or description. If the executor is a trustworthy man he can always furnish security; if he is not, there is the greater reason for exacting it from him. The appellant has no ground of complaint.</p>
