      <em>May </em>17. The land of Meisenhelter having been sold by the sheriff, auditors were appointed to make distribution, who awarded the proceeds to his judgment creditors, and a mechanic’s lien. Exceptions were filed to this report by the appellant and others, and an issue asked, to try their right to priority of lien as legatees of a former owner.

      <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>In 1823, John Boose devised this land, consisting of one hundred and eighty acres, to his son Peter, directing that he should pay out of it seventeen dollars per acre to the rest of his heirs, in yearly sums of one hundred dollars. In 1838, Peter, the son, having died, his administrators petitioned the Orphan’s Court for leave to sell his real estate for payment of debts and maintenance of children. Whereupon the court ordered the sale to be made to the highest and best bidder. The administrators returned that they' had sold the land to Meisenhelter for $5757, he being the highest and. best bidder, and that the best price, &amp;c. Whereupon the court confirmed the sale and ordered a deed to be made for the same estate, and in as full, clear, and ample a manner as Peter Boose had therein, at the time of his decease, subject to the payment of the purchase-money according to the conditions of sale. The deed by the administrators, in the same year, recited the premises and conveyed the land in fee, in consideration of the amount of the bid, “ to them in hand paid, the receipt whereof is hereby acknowledged.” No other receipt for the purchase-money was shown, nor did the proceedings in the court or the deed make mention of any charge or lien on the land, reserved or otherwise.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b243-4" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[158,1435,1170,424]]]'>In the conditions of the sale made by the administrators of Peter, it was stated that the purchaser was to pay one hundred dollars yearly to the heirs of John Boose, according to his will, commencing in 1839, until $1582 were paid, and the residue in cash, subject as to one-third, to remain as a dower-fund for the widow of Peter, the principal to his heirs at her death. Meisenhelter and the auctioneer proved the sale according to these conditions, and that but $1000 of the purchase-money had been paid to the administrators of Peter.</p>

When ordering the sale, the Orphan’s Court virtually prescribed as a condition, the payment of the purchase-money in cash, or at least before the delivery of the deed, for such is always to be taken as the terms of such a sale when no other conditions are expressly imposed by the court. Had the administrators a right of their own mere motion to stipulate other and different conditions, by which a lien upon the land sold could be either créated or prolonged ? Repeated decisions in this state have settled the principle that an officer of the court, whether called sheriff or administrator, executing its process for the sale of land, in payment of debts, has no power to prescribe conditions other than those which the law or the court has indicated, and his attempt to do so will not be permitted to affect, as with a lien, interests subsequently acquired by third persons, either as purchasers for value or encumbrancers; Hellman <em>v. </em>Hellman, <em><a href="/rawle/4/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="4 Rawle 440" data-case-ids="1823534" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0440-01">supra;</a> </em>Eshelman <em>v. </em>Witmer, <a href="/watts/2/0263-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="2 Watts 263" data-case-ids="1840097" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0263-01">2 Watts, 263</a>; Aulenbaugh <em>v. </em>Umbehauer, <a href="/watts/8/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="8 Watts 48" data-case-ids="1848501" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0048-01">8 Watts, 48</a>; S.

But were this otherwise, and granting that such subsequent party in interest might be affected by a second lien, not appearing of record or on the face of the title, but of which he had express notice or means of notice, how could this interfere with the claims of Meisenhelter’s creditors, to whom the court below has awarded the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale ?

Absolutely nothing. The administrators’ conditions were not returned with the order of sale, nor in. any way alluded to in the certificate of sale made to the court. On the contrary, the administrators expressly reported that they had made sale to David Meisenhelter for a sum certain, according to the order issued to them, and this sale was afterwards confirmed, subject to the payment of the purchase-money, <em>according to the conditions of sale, </em>meaning, of course, those prescribed by the court, for of these conditions only had it any knowledge. Acting upon the decree which directed a conveyance to the purchaser, the' administrators subsequently executed a deed to Meisenhelter, containing a recital of the proceedings had in the Orphan’s Court, just as they appear of record; an acknowledgment of the payment of the purchase-money, being the amount bid at the sale, and granting the estate as it existed in the decedent in his lifetime. Nowhere are the private conditions of sale even hinted at. Indeed, it may be asserted, without hazard of error, that so far from there being any intimation in the record or on the face of the deed, to which the parties were alone bound to look, tending to disclose the existence of a second lien, every thing visible led to a directly contrary conclusion. Were we then disposed-, under any circumstances, to put subsequent <em>Iona fide </em>encumbrances to the hazard of an inquiry <em>in pais, </em>there is nothing here making such an inquiry incumbent upon them. Consulting the record of sale, they found the lien of the legacies satisfied and extinguished by operation of law. They had a right to/ rely upon this as importing verity, and no verbal intimation, had such even been shown, would have been sufficient to bind them to inquire into the validity of the supposed liens. Repeating an observation made by Mr. Justice Sergeant, in Mode’s Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0280-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 280" data-case-ids="480155" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0280-01">6 Watts &amp; Serg. 280</a>, it may truly be said that no person would buy, or creditor lend his money, if he was liable to be affected by such claims. We are, therefore, ufiable to perceive any equity in the legatees superior to the legal right of the judgment creditors, and consequently the decree of the court below, preferring the claims of the latter, must be affirmed.</p>
    <p id="b246-4" data-blocks='[["BL_246.4",246,[353,2235,1170,238]]]'>There is nothing in the objection to the action of the court, in. refusing to direct an issue, simply because there was no disputed fact requiring the intervention of a jury. Admitting all the legatees averred, it would not enable them to come in on the fund in preference to the judgment creditors. Decree affirmed.</p>
