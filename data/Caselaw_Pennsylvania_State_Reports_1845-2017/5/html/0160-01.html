      <em>April </em>7. This was an action against Mercer as endorser of a promissory note, the execution and protest of which, with the notary’s recital of notice by depositing the same in the West Chester post-office, was proved by the plaintiff. It appeared that the drawer, haying purchased goods of one Marshall, had given his two notes therefor, with Lancaster as surety. That Lancaster having become dissatisfied, required a change in his liability, to which the drawer agreed; and thereupon, at a meeting of the parties, the note in question was executed. Lancaster, subsequently to <em>his </em>receiving it, took up the two original notes with his own, which he paid before this action was brought.</p>

In fact, it is an ordinary mercantile transaction, and whether viewed as accommodation paper or a note, drawn by Bearce to Mercer, and by him endorsed to Lancaster, with the special purpose of enabling the latter to raise money to relieve himself from a responsibility previously contracted as surety, it imports a legal and valid consideration, And in addition to this view of <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>the case, which would he decisive, it is obvious it puts Lancaster in a worse position than he would have been had not the note been executed, and this has been repeatedly held to be a consideration sufficient to support a promise. The original notes, for which the note in suit, was a substitute, having arrived at maturity, Lancaster had a right to require Marshall forthwith to proceed by adversary process, if necessary, to collect the money due. But this unquestionable right he debars himself from by accepting a note at ninety days, for it would be contrary to his agreement, and consequently a wrong to C. M. Pierce and Mercer, to require the immediate collection of the money by adversary process. A consideration is sufficient, if it arise from any act of the plaintiff, from which the defendant or á stranger derives any benefit, however small, if such act is performed by the plaintiff, with the assent, express or implied, of the defendant; or by reason of any damage, or any suspension, or forbearance of the plaintiff’s right at law, or in equity, or any possibility of loss occasioned to the plaintiff by the promise of another, although no actual benefit accrues to the party undertaking; Hind <em>v. </em>Holdship, <a href="/watts/2/0104-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Watts 104" data-case-ids="1840135" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0104-01">2 Watts, 104</a>.

To this direction we perceive nothing amiss. For although there was a post-office nearer his dwelling, than the one used, in this instance, yet if he was in the habit, as the jury have found, of using that, as more convenient for his business, it was an accommodation to the defendant, as it was more likely to reach him if the notice was put into the West Chester office, and of course the defendant has no just right to complain. Indeed, had it been sent to the post-office nearest his dwelling, it is likely the complaint would have assumed a different aspect, and certainly with as good reason. It is impossible for us to say there was no evidence of the.fact proper to be' submitted to the jury, for although there may have been a temporary suspension of the habit of doing his business at the latter post-office, yet it was afterwards resumed, and we have no reason to believe it was known to others that his manner of doing his business, in this particular, had ever been suspended. When the facts are admitted, notice of non-payment is a question of law, but the jury must find the <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>facts, and in this case they were left ,to them, under a proper direction from the court. . Although the case may not require an expression of opinion on this point, yet I am inclined to believe, that, as the case stands, notice would-be'good, whether given through one or the other medium.</p>
    <p id="b163-4" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[205,681,1177,1269]]]'>We see no error in admitting the evidence contained, in the bill of exceptions. It was Relevant'to the issue to proye the’dissatisfaction of Lancaster, the surety in the first two notes; that Pierce, the drawee, was informed of that fact; that he offered to give a new note, with the defendant as surety; that a time was fixed for giving the new note; that Mercer, Lancaster, and Pierce, met together, and that, in pursuance of an agreement then made, the note in controversy was given. It is not obnoxious to the objection, that it is the mere declaration of Pierce, for it is introductory to the agreement, part of the <em>res </em>gestee, and absolutely necessary to a correct understanding of the manner and reason of giving the last note, and affords an explanation of the form it assumed. It is so connected and blended with the execution of the note, that the justice of the' case on either side requires the evidence. It must be remarked, that the evidence was confined to what took place at a time when neither party anticipated any controversy. Such evidence has ever been received, and is essential to the ascertainment of truth, and the administration of justice. It is, in truth, often the only mode that is left to ascertain the object and intent of the parties to the contract. And, fin the case in hand, without the aid derived from this testimony, we should.be at a loss to understand the -reason the note was given; but with the light afforded from this source, we have hero.no difficulty in seeing that it is a transaction, by no means unusual, where a surety, having reason to believe that he. is in some peril, asks and obtains from his principal an indemnity for being bound.</p>
