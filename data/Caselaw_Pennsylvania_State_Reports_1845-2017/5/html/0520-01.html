      <em>June </em>28. From the paper-book, it appeared this was an action of assumpsit for rent brought by “the heirs of James Trimble, by their agent, O. Rawn, against Frankem, bail for Ely.” A judgment having been obtained, an execution was issued, which was returned <em>nulla </em>Iona, as appeared from the printed paper-book, though in the written copy of the same proceeding there does not appear any statement of an execution having issued from the justice. A transcript was then filed in the Common Pleas. An execution then issued and land was condemned. A <em>sei. fa. </em>and <em>al. sei. fa. </em>then issued to revive, and judgment was entered.</p>

Rawn, as agent for the heirs of Trimble, had let certain premises by agreement in writing, to Hyers. At a subsequent period Ely became a party thereto as tenant; and Frankem bound himself by a separate instrument for payment of the rent.</p>

Whether the transcript could have been amended in the Common Pleas, it is not necessary to determine, as there was no application to the court for that purpose, and amendments are now too late; Our courts have been and ought to be liberal in allowing the proper parties to be placed on the record in appeals from justices of the peace, when the cause of action is not changed.

The view taken in this case, renders this point of little consequence to the suit under consideration. The 10th section of the one hundred dollar act provides that the prothonotaries shall enter on their dockets transcripts of judgments obtained before justices of the proper'counties, which judgments, from the time of entry, bind real estate; but no <em>fieri facias </em>shall be issued by any pro» <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>thonotary until a certificate shall he first produced to him from the justice before whom the original judgment was entered, stating therein that an execution had issued to the proper constable, and a return had been made thereon that no goods could be found.
