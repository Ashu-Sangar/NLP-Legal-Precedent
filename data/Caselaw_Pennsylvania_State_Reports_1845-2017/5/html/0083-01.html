      <em>March </em>15. — The first count of the hill of indictment in this case, as it was laid before the grand jury, charged William Shouse, the plaintiff in error, and Jacob Shouse, with two others, with “riotously, routously, and unlawfully” meeting together and tearing down the dwelling-house of one Wells. The second count laid an assault and battery in the same manner. The third laid an unlawful assembling to disturb the peace, &amp;c., under similar words. The grand jury found a true bill against all the defendants for a riot, and “ for an assault and battery” against William and John Shouse, (who was not named in the bill.) On the trial, the jury found defendants not guilty of the riot, and plaintiff in error guilty of assault and battery. The sentence was a fine of six cents and costs. A motion in arrest of judgment had been made and overruled, on the ground that William Shouse could not, under the indictment, be convicted of a common assault and battery. The three errors assigned will be found in the opinion of Mr. Justice Burnside.</p>

It would <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>have been safer to have had a count for a common assault and battery, as the general rule is, that the grand jury should find the whole bill or reject it; but this rule does not hold when there are different counts, laying different and distinct offences.

It is enough to prove so much of the indictment as shows that the defendants, or any one of them has committed a substantial crime therein specified; 2 Camp. 585; Roscoe, Crim. Ev.76, (92.) As upon an indictment for murder, the prisoner may be .convicted of manslaughter; or, on an indictment for burglary and larceny, the jury may find him guilty of the simple felony, and acquit him of the burglary; 2 Hale, P. C. 302. Where an indictment charged the defendant with an assault, and an intent to abuse and carnally' know a female child, held, that he might be convicted of an assault to abuse her simply, as the averment of such intention is divisible ; Rex <em>v. </em>Dawson, 3 Starkie, 62, (14 E. C. L. R.) On an indictment for an assault with intent to murder, there may be a conviction of an assault simply; <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Ohio%20242" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="5 Ohio 242">5 Ohio Rep. 242</a>. This is the law and practice of Pennsylvania. The grand jury found the bill against all the defendants for a riot, and added for an assault and battery against the two Shouses. I agree the grand jury do not possess the divisible power of a traverse jury — but we must bear in mind only William Shouse is before us, as all 'the others were acquitted, and both the findings, as to him, are affirmative of the whole indictment. So far as he is concerned, there is nothing negative; the whole bill is found. Was the charge in the second count divisible ? We all think it was ;, it is so on principle, and such has been, so far as our knowledge extends, the universal practice of Pennsylvania. The learned counsel of the plaintiff in error relies on the case of The King <em>v. </em>Sudbury, in 1 Ld. Raym. 484. There three were indicted for riot and a riotous assault and battery in the same count, two only were convicted; the conviction of the three being necessary to constitute a riot. There was no special finding by the petit jury against either of the defendants of an assault and battery. The counsel for the crown, as they could <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>not ask for judgment on the indictment for a riot, requested the court to pass judgment on the two found guilty generally for an assault and battery, which Lord Iiolt refused. If there had been a divisible finding by'the jury, the cases would be parallel. We cannot, on the authority of this case, overturn the principle so well settled in analogous cases, and what we believe to be a practice well-founded and long in use in this State.</p>
