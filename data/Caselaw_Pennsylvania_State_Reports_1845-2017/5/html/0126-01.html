The site of the mill-pond, in which the trespass was committed, is now in <em>Dublin </em>township. In 1834, the sheriff, under a judgment and execution against Justus Scheetz, levied on and sold to the present plaintiff the mill and tract of 'land, containing ninety-four acres in <em>■Springfield </em>township, with the <em>appurtenances. </em>The plaintiff gave <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>evidence that a tenant of Emlen’s land, (now owned by defendant,) about forty years before this action, had put up and repaired the fence around the margin of the mill-pond, as it then stood. About 1817, Justus Scheetz dug a trench through the pond, which had become in part filled up, thereby draining a large portion of the former site. It was shortly after this that he commenced ploughing and cultivating it, which was continued by the sheriff’s vendee.</p>

There was conflicting evidence as to defendant’s acts of ownership and possession, which was left to the jury under instructions by the court (Krause, P. J.) on the following points of law arising thereon. As to Emlen’s deed to Lardner, they said, “ that it conveys land, and not merely an easement or incorporeal hereditament, by the words ‘ site and soil,’ they being as strong to convey land, as the words ‘debts, dues, and demands, real, personal, and mixed,’ coupled with ‘ heirs and assigns,’ are to convey the fee; and these latter words have been-held, <a href="/serg-rawl/12/0269-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 Serg. &amp; Rawle 269" data-case-ids="8878536" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/12/0269-01">12 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 269</a>, to convey a fee-simple in land.

He conveyed a qualified fee, determinable on the abandonment by Lardner, his heirs or assigns, of the use and service for which the conveyance was made, as stated in his deed. And in conveying such limited fee, he retained the reversion in himself; and that he could permit to descend, or sell to others.

That the recital in Emlen’s deed to Lardner was notice, and- the purchaser was bound by its restrictions. Therefore the plaintiff could not tack his adverse possession to that of Justus Scheetz, and if that commenced in 1817, that point was out of the case; since . his possession was interrupted by the plaintiff, under the levy and sale, before.it had been continued adversely for twenty-one years. As to Scheetz’s possession prior to 1817, it was not hostile unless he had done some act, and shown a clear intention to abandon the right under the Emlen deed, and the limitation there prescribed; until then, he held under one title with Emlen, both together constituting one fee-simple, and Emlen having an interest which would sustain an action for a permanent injury to the freehold.</p>

He erred, however, in charging that the adverse possession of Justus Scheetz did not pass to the plaintiffs by the sheriff’s deed. In Overfield <em>v. </em>Christie, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%20177" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="7 Serg. &amp; Rawle 177">7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 177</a>, in which the opinion of Judge Washington in Potts <em>v. </em>Gilbert, 3 Wash. C. C. R. 475, was overruled, it was settled that the adverse possession of an occupant without right might be transferred to a purchaser, and continued by him for the residue of the time necessary to form a bar by the statute of limitations, and this principle the judge, did not controvert. His position — and it is one of which it is difficult to explain the fallacy — was that the <em>locus in quo, </em>having reverted, did not pass by the sheriff’s deed, which conveyed no more than the tract to which it had ceased to be appurtenant; and consequently, that <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a>it did not pass the adverse possession. But the possession may be passed without the title. The deed professed to pass the appurtenances belonging to the tract; and if the <em>locus </em>had not ceased to be occupied as an appurtenance, though the title to it were gone, the deed would pass the occupant’s possession of it, as it would have passed the title to it had the occupant still held it. A proprietor who occupies his neighbour’s land as a part of his farm, may certainly transfer his possession of the whole by a conveyance of the farm. Such is the principle of Overfield <em>v. </em>Christie, which is different from this case only in the immaterial respect, that there the conveyance was made by the occupant to the purchaser. But a sheriff’s deed passes all that the debtor could convey, and is necessarily as operative in every respect. There was, however, evidence of entry to be left to the jury, as well as other considerations in the cause, which may yet, perhaps, avoid the statutory bar.</p>
