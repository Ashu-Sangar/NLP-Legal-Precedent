      <em>May </em>28. This was an action of replevin for four rafts of timber, of which, defendant claimed title as a purchaser, under executions against Ralston, one of which issued at the suit of the defendant. For the purposes of the decision here it is necessary to set out the evidence given in the cause at unusual length. The plaintiff gave evidence of the possession of the property by P. Nolen, and sale by him to his brother, the plaintiff. P. Nolen, having been released from any warranty of title, stated under objection, that he had been a partner with Ralston in making lumber out of timber belonging to Ralston, and in 1844 informed him that a writ, at the suit of Irvine, was issued, and then proposed that one should buy out the other. The next day he bought out Ralston’s interest, received possession, and ran the rafts down the river, where he bargained with Quigley to run them to market and sell them, but they were detained a year on account of the lowness of the water; he <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>then sold them to his brother, a few weeks before the levy, who paid $411, and gave his note for the balance of the price agreed upon, $760, which was yet unpaid. He admitted that, after this sale, he had made a written agreement to sell the same property in his own name, but stated he then acted as agent, and that his reason for purchasing from Ralston was to save himself, because his creditors were coming on him. The plaintiff, who thus purchased, was a sawyer who had been employed in getting out the timber.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b321-4" data-blocks='[["BL_321.4",321,[151,842,1180,1464]]]'>The defendant then proved judgments confessed by Ralston, and executions immediately issued, under which he purchased, with notice of plaintiff’s claim. He then gave evidence that plaintiff had said that P. Nolen was about taking some of his own lumber with this, which belonged to Ralston, to market, and selling it; that the sale to-P. Nolen was nothing but a sham to prevent Ralston’s creditors from seizing and sacrificing it, and when sold in Nolen’s name the money would go to pay Ralston’s debts. Ralston (called as a witness) stated the timber was his, and that Irvine had agreed to wait a year for his money; but on finding an execution had been issued, he (Ralston) was about delivering up his property to another when he met P. Nolen, who, being informed of the circumstances, advised a gale to himself, and said the timber might be run down and sold in his name, and the proceeds divided among his creditors. Ralston agreed, and sold all his property to him for several notes, amounting to $800. These were delivered in a private room, where he also handed Nolen $20 or $30 in relief notes, of one and two dollars each. When they left the room, a witness was procured, and the banknotes paid back, as if on the contract, counting the ones as tens and the twos as twenties. The plaintiff was then present. The notes were to be returned when the lumber was sold, and expenses paid. He denied that a partnership ever existed. Nolen had promised to give his receipt, but finding he had gone without doing so, Ralston pursued him, and meeting plaintiff, inquired about it; he stated that his brother had sold to him, and the design was to keep it • from the creditors. When P. Nolen came up he confirmed the fact of the sale, but directed Ralston to go on and use the same authority as before. The notes of P. Nolen had been assigned to the present defendant two days before confession of the judgment, but Ralston said he did not expect he would issue execution.</p>

Nolen, by his own statements, and proved that plaintiff was a day labourer, and reputed to be worth nothing. There was some other evidence of Ralston’s admissions of having <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>made a sale of the lumber to P. Nolen, and a good deal attacking the characters of both Nolen, Ralston, and some of the other witnesses. There was also evidence that P.

J.,) in charging the jury, said, in substance, — the question was one of ownership of the property, which clearly was originally Ralston’s; that there was also clearly an apparent transfer of that property to P. Nolen, whether fair, as he testified, or fraudulent or otherwise, as Ralston proved. That there were notorious acts of ownership and ¡possession accompanying this transfer, and one question was, whether the plaintiff was a purchaser <em>Iona </em>fide, and without notice of the fraud between P. Nolen and Ralston, in which case he would not be affected by it. That Ralston’s testimony was relied on to prove the fraud, that was to be taken with the facts of the confession of judgment and assignment of the notes of P. Nolen <em>to the present </em>plaintiff. Supposing he was believed, was there any thing more than a fair transfer for value by one indebted ? As to the property, other than the lumber, it appeared conceded to be fraudulent; but the lumber was sold for a real and apparently adequate consideration; it might be that there was a mistake as to P. Nolen’s capacity to pay; but nevertheless Ralston did sell and receive the securities, and permit the purchaser to expend his money, and contract for the transportation ; and all would probably have gone on well if a rise in the river had permitted the lumber to get to market. But being detained there a year until a sale to plaintiff, then Ralston confesses judgment, and causes this property to be seized by the creditor, who still holds the notes given for the purchase. If there had been a mere colourable delivery of possession, and not a transfer of title, accompanied with possession and expenditure, then defendant might have seized, “ but the difficulty is to find such was the transaction from the testimony of Ralston.” The jury were to find the facts, but they could scarcely, from his testimony, find any other reason for his receipt of the paper and its transfer, than that it was the agreed price, and Ralston’s security that Nolen would apply the proceeds <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>to his creditors. If so, how could defendant upset it a year after-wards ? If he was a creditor, he was provided for; and as he held the notes, he seemed to have no right to complain of this mode of getting the timber to market. If he thought it fraudulent, why did he not act on his old judgment in another county, a year sooner. If the sale to P. Nolen was fair, his transfer to his brother, though injudicious, would not vitiate the former transaction. On Ralston’s testimony was there any evidence of fraud ? P. Nolen showed a fraud much greater on his part; but if there was a transfer and exclusive possession, defendant had no right to seize. If Ralston be "believed, it was for the jury to say whether the transfer was merely colourable. Under this view they were to determine whether plaintiff \was a purchaser without notice, as to which the court recapitulated the evidence. '</p>

The timber, when sold by Patrick Nolen to his brother James, was not moved. Where one called to testify believes himself to be interested, he is not competent. Patrick Nolen believed himself to be interested, and was therefore incompetent to testify.

The counsel below submitted no points to the court by which they would have been drawn precisely to the legal position maintained by counsel here, as the true aspect of the case. The court wander over the whole facts, and view them with a strong bias, and intimate that they involve no <em>actual </em>fraud, but give no instruction as to what constitutes legal fraud; and the cause has been argued pretty much in the same way here. The apprehension, or perhaps more properly the comprehension, of actual fraud, depends much upon the moral sensibilities of the individual who contemjdates the facts out of which it is supposed to arise. It is not, therefore, giving all the light and aid to <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>a jury which they ought to receive from the court, to tell them “the jury will decide whether there was a <em>Iona fide </em>sale of the timber by Ralston to Patrick, accompanied with clear and exclusive possession, or only a colourable delivery of possession to cloak it from the creditors without a <em>bona fide </em>sale of the title,” because, under such circumstances, it is often a matter of total indifference whether the alleged sale was <em>bona fide </em>or not. As against creditors it may not have the <em>taint </em>of actual fraud, and yet have the invalidity of <em>legal </em>fraud, although perfectly <em>bona fide. </em>Besides, the learned judge ought to have told the jury what constituted “clear and exclusive possession,” as the greatest amount of difficulty in many cases of this class arises from the description or kind of possession accompanying and following the alleged transfer. The court made a strong argument to the jury to evince that no actual fraud existed, and they said emphatically, “ taking Ralston’s testimony to be the true view of the case, are any' grounds disclosed for treating his sale to Patrick as fraudulent ?” This is a pregnant inquiry, and, taken in connection with all the court said before, could only be understood by the jury to m,ean that from all the testimony of Ralston, (whom the court, near the close of the charge, call the “ champion of the defence,”) there was no fraud, even according to the strongest evidence in favour of the defendant. And so instructing, I think the jury were misled, and that it was error in the court.</p>
    <p id="b325-4" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[168,1577,1178,141]]]'>It appears to me to be a very gross case, with fraud sticking out at its elbows and knees, and especially and strongly so by the testimony of the said Ralston.</p>

Patrick told me I had better not do it, for McCord would serve me as Irvin did. But he advised me to sell it to him, and the timber could be run down, and I could get the proceeds and divide it among my creditors. I thought the plan good; he had been a friend. I said it was his timber after this. He took every thing I had that the sheriff could seize, timber, grain and all. He gave me notes for the timber to the amount of about $800. These are the six notes. They were given in a private room. I had got $10 from Joel Cadbury, to enable me to take down the lumber. I gave Patrick $25 or $30 of these notes — relief notes — in the private room. We had Mathews outside to witness. We wore locked up. We came out in an entry. James was there. Patrick counted and gave me the money I had given him in the room, calling the ones tens, and the twos twenties.- The money in that way came to about <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>$200. After that, I always said the lumber was Patrick’s. The notes for $800 were to be returned when the lumber was sold and money paid. I had got the hands to run the raft down, but told them it was Patrick’s. I stuck to the raft. Was along when it was left at Quigley’s, the water being low.” This is the outline of Ralston’s testimony; the filling up only gives blotches of deeper hue. As a finale, however, he says that Patrick sold to his brother James, who was not worth a groat, with a view, as James told him, to keep it from creditors, with much more still darkening the aspect of the case. Now it appears to me that this disclosed a case of actual fraud, with a deep moral taint. There was secrecy, concealment, falsehood, duplicity — all with a view of defeating, or at least delaying and hindering the creditors of Ralston. There is mingled up with the case acts which the law abhors, and which are resorted to for the purpose of overcoming the law and the rights of others. This appears to me to be actual fraud. But can there be a doubt of its being a case of legal fraud? There was no delivering of possession, at least no evidence of it. It is true that a raft is not the subject of manual delivery, but every thing in the power of the parties ought to have been done. Hence as to a ship at sea, a symbolical delivery is sufficient. But here nothing whatever was done. There was. neither symbolical delivery nor any declaration or manifestation of delivery, except what might be implied from Ralston’s telling the hands and others that the lumber was Nolen’s. But Ralston could have left the raft, after making a public declaration in the presence of witnesses, that he delivered it up and over to Nolen. This would have been some manifestation to the public of the delivery of possession and change of property. But instead of that, Ralston continues on the raft just as he had done before, and remains with it till the water fails, and it is stowed away at Quigley’s. He furnishes considerable part of tjie money that was to pay expenses, &amp;c. There was not that visible, open change of possession which the law requires, and it was the duty of the court so to instruct the jury, because in such cases the court must judge as to those acts which are sufficient evidence of delivery; Clow <em>v. </em>Woods, <a href="/serg-rawl/5/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 Serg. &amp; Rawle 275" data-case-ids="1804298" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/5/0275-01">5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 275</a>; Streeper <em>v. </em>Eckart, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Whart.%20308" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Whart. 308">2 Whart. 308</a>; Carpenter <em>v. </em>Mayer, <a href="/watts/5/0483-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Watts 483" data-case-ids="1844087" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0483-01">5 Watts, 483</a>; Young <em>v. </em>McClure, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0147-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 147" data-case-ids="1853591" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0147-01">2 Watts &amp; Serg, 147</a>; Avery <em>v. </em>Street, <a href="/watts/6/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Watts 247" data-case-ids="1846137" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0247-01">6 Watts, 247</a>, <em>cum multís aliis.</em>
