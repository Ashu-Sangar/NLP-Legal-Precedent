      <em>May </em>19. — F. Eichelberger, by his will, gave certain parts of his estate to his children who were then living, and to the widow and children of B., a deceased son, and a legacy to his grandson Abraham, son of GK, a deceased son, more particularly mentioned hereafter. On'the share of B.’s children he charged a sum during the life of one Horn, and at his death “ to be equally divided, share and share alike, as my other estate is divided.” By a codicil, he created trustees for the widow and children of Daniel, a deceased son, who had been named as a devisee in the will, and provided that “ if any of said children die leaving issue, any share then in the hands of the trustee is to be paid to such issue, and if no such issue be left, then the same is to be paid over to the surviving children of said son Daniel.” The residue of the estate was divided by the will into eight shares, one of which was to go to each of his sons and his daughter, the child of his son Gr., deceased, and the children of his son D., deceased. By a codicil this was changed, and the residue given equally to one son, a daughter, and a daughter-in-law, the widow of a deceased son.</p>

It is, whether the grandchildren of the testator are entitled to a portion of the sum bequeathed by the will to Abraham Eichelberger, who died without issue, in the following terms:</p>
    <p id="A-hZ" data-blocks='[["BL_265.14",265,[169,1718,1174,435]]]'>“ I give and bequeath to my grandson, Abraham Eichelberger, son of George Eichelberger, deceased, the sum of ¿£1500, the sum of which his step-father, Martin Eichelberger, has in his hands ¿6900 already, of which his mother is to have the interest during her natural life, and after her decease to be considered as a vested legacy to come to him; and it is further my will that if my grandson Abraham should die without issue, then the part <em>as </em>willed to him is to fall to my <em>heirs </em>back to be divided amongst my children as in my will mentioned, share and share alike.”</p>
    <p id="b265-10" data-blocks='[["BL_265.15",265,[170,2156,1172,292]]]'>This question was not mooted in Eichelberger <em>v. </em>Barnitz, <a href="/serg-rawl/17/0293-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="17 Serg. &amp; Rawle 293" data-case-ids="1818182" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/17/0293-01">17 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 293</a>. All that was decided there was, that by force of the word “ children,” the .limitation over, on the death of the first taker, was not too remote, and consequently good. But the present inquiry is to proceed upon different principles; and to be determined by other rules of construction.</p>

But it is still a question of intention, as in other cases, and whenever it can be collected from the whole will and its attendant circumstances, that the testator used the word in an enlarged sense, and not merely according to its natural import, such a meaning may be assigned to it as will be inclusive of grandchildren, though the intention so to use it is only manifested by implication; Marsh <em>v. </em>Hague, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Edw.%20Ch.%20186" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Edw.

From necessity, when there be no children, strictly speaking, to answer the description; and 2. When it is evidently used as co-extensive with the word <em>issue </em>or words of similar import, having a like extended signification, or mentioned indiscriminately with them; Roper, 69; Wyth <em>v. </em>Blackman, 1 Ves. 196; Dickinson <em>v. </em>Lee, <a href="/watts/4/0082-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 Watts 82" data-case-ids="1842766" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0082-01">4 Watts, 82</a>.</p>

Before and after the particular clause, he notices his grandchildren as well as his children, as the objects of his bounty, devising and bequeathing to them land and money, and joins them indiscriminately in a general bequest of the residue. It is plain that when preparing the will he had in his mind’s eye all his family, consisting of his immediate descendants then living, but that he did not look beyond these, or contemplate the possibility of collaterals taking by force of any part of the will. Carrying this fact along, and noticing that the property bequeathed over, on the death of Abraham Eichelberger, is personalty, we cannot doubt that the word « heirs,” when it occurs in the clause, was employed as synonymous with issue or descendants, as was also the case in Baskin’s Appeal, 3 Barr, 304. The bequest over may, therefore, be properly read, “ if my grandson Abraham should die without issue, then the part willed to him is to fall back to my descendants living, to be divided amongst my children, as in my will mentioned,” &amp;c. It was to fall back to his descendants, to be divided amongst them, which tends strongly to show that he used the word “children” in the enlarged sense. This brings the be<a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>quest within, the rule already noticed- This construction is fortified by the phrase,’ <em>“ </em>as in will mentioned,” which evidently refers to the residuary clause made at the same time with the other portions of the will, giving indiscriminately to the children and grandchildren. v</p>
