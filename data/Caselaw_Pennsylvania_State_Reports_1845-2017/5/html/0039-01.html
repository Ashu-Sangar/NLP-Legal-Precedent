Hart, who survived H. M. Hart, trading as H. M. &amp; B. B. Hart. At the time of executing this assignment B. B. Hart was a resident in Philadelphia. The court below gave judgment for the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b40-3" data-blocks='[["BL_40.4",40,[349,731,1171,281]]]'>The only question raised here was, whether the plaintiffs were such creditors as could take advantage of the omission to record the instrument; <em>i. e., </em>whether the property of H. M. &amp; B. B. Hart could be levied on under a judgment against Hart, Labatt &amp; Co.; it not being questioned that the persons composing the former firm had also been members of the latter.</p>

[Per <em>Quriam. </em>— This is not so much a judgment as an execution.] The execution should then have been awarded subject to the claims of the joint creditors. The rule that joint assets are not to be applied to individual debts until after the joint debts are paid, is so well settled that authorities are unnecessary.</p>

The rule contended for is the privilege of the partners to enable them to settle their claims between each other — not of the creditors <em>of </em>the firm, who cannot be heard in the matter. As, then, the assignors were jointly and separately liable, it is impossible for them to claim this privilege.

The same point is ruled in Doner <em>v. </em>Stauffer, 1 Penna.

Hart to Wharton &amp; Mecke, for the purpose of paying certain creditors, of what description does not appear, nor is <em>there </em>any schedule of <em>the </em>property in the bill of exceptions. But the deed being executed by B. B. Hart, transferred his property, and was intended to transfer the property of H. M. Hart, deceased, no doubt, as the caption states that it is made by Barnet B. Hart, who survived Hyman M. Hart, trading as H. M. &amp; B. B. Hart. It appears there were two firms, that of Hart, Labatt &amp; Co., and H. M. &amp; B. B. Hart. The assignment was clearly void as against the attaching creditors; and it is the product of the assigned property in the hands of the garnishee, which the plaintiff below claims.</p>

If it belonged to the firm of Hart, Labatt &amp; Co., that firm was liable for the debt of Grant <em>&amp; </em>Stone. In every aspect in which the case can be viewed, the property, moneys, and effects attached were liable for the debt for which it was seized. And no equity has been made apparent, which 'ought to allow the garnishees, who are the plaintiffs in error, to arrest it in its appropriation to a debt for which it is in process of execution, according to well-established principles of law.</p>
