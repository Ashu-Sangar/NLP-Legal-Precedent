The suit was in the name of the Commonwealth, and the judgment was for the penalty. The question is, was this a final, or mere cautionary judgment ? If it be the latter, the plaintiff below could not recover. The test of a final judgment is, whether execution can issue upon it. Here the statute declares, that execution shall not issue for the penalty of the bond or the judgment for the penalty, but for the sum found due on the <em>scire facias. </em>This court have decided that the judgment finds nothing but a forfeiture of the penalty in favour of Commonwealth, as a mere nominal trustee without interest; <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%2067" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Serg. &amp; Rawle 67">9 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 67</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%20132" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Serg. &amp; Rawle 132">8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 132</a>.

That was not a suit upon an administration bond, but one upon a bond given by executors under a special decree of the court. In that case also, the verdict and judgment were not only for the penalty, but for the specific amount of damages assessed by the jury in favour of the party injured, upon the payment of which the execution would be released. It was therefore in every respect final. The specific sum claimed by the plaintiff was found. Judgment was entered for that sum, and was ripe for execution. No analogy exists between that and the present case. No decree or sentence of the court was ever made on John Maffit, the plaintiff in error, to pay any part of this money to any one. We further contend, that Thomas Todd, as administrator <em>de bonis </em>non, could not sustain the action. Before the act of 24th of February, 1834, it seems to be settled that he could not, <a href="/rawle/3/0361-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Rawle 361" data-case-ids="1822499" data-case-paths="/rawle/3/0361-01">3 Rawle, 361</a>; and the case is not embraced under the act of 1834.

It is final under our act of the 14th June, 1836, (Dunlop, 689, Pamph. L. 688,) in favour of the Commonwealth, that the bond is forfeited, and there it stands for the use and benefit of all who have an interest in the misconduct of the administrator. They are entitled under the act to writs of <em>scire facias </em>on the Commonwealth’s judgment. But it is only interlocutory as to strangers; for the 11th section of the act provides, that in all cases, where the condition of an administration bond is broken, after a judgment for the Commonwealth, it shall be lawful for the party aggrieved to proceed by a writ of <em>scire facias </em>upon the judgment, suggesting his interest therein, to assess and recover the damages he shall have sustained.</p>
    <p id="b366-6" data-blocks='[["BL_366.6",366,[364,1590,1168,633]]]'>In this case no <em>scire facias </em>had issued upon the Commonwealth’s judgment, suggesting any interest in Thomas Todd in the lifetime of Elizabeth Beale, the administratrix; nor is a devastavit alleged to have been committed during her coverture with Maffit. After the evidence was closed, the facts were agreed to be taken as a special verdict, reserving to each party bills of exception. The learned judge afterwards delivered an elaborate opinion, and gave judgment for the plaintiff. In this we think there was manifest error, the law being, that where the husband has not, by his own acts, made himself responsible, he is only liable for the wife’s devastavit, whilst the marriage subsisted between them; so that when it determines before a judgment or decree is obtained against them for the demand, his, or his wife’s death, discharges the liability.</p>
    <p id="b366-7" data-blocks='[["BL_366.7",366,[365,2227,1164,179]]]'>We deem a judgment Tor the Commonwealth on the administration bond insufficient in a case like this. It is no judgment for this demand; and the death of the wife discharged the husband from the devastavit of the wife before coverture.</p>
    <p id="b366-8" data-blocks='[["BL_366.8",366,[491,2422,1039,81]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and judgment for the plaintiff in error.</p>
