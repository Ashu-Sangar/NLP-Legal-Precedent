J.) said that the plaintiff’s claim to one-tenth, founded on the construction giving a trust to the wife, and the fee to the children only, could not be supported. For if they claimed as <em>cestuis que trust </em>merely, their estate would determine with that of the trustee; for, in deeds, technical words of limitation are always <em>essential; </em>1 Dali. 139; 3 Wash. C. C. R. 498; Prest, on Est. 65. But that all difficulty on this point was obviated by considering the words “ their heirs” to refer to both Mary Shirlock and her children, and treating them all as grantees in the deed. Doe <em>v. </em>Martin, 4 Term Rep. 39, showed words in a deed might be transposed in this manner for the purpose of preserving an estate. In 3 Bulst. 128, Lord Coke says the word “heirs” need not be in any particular place in the deed, as in the case of a grant of a rent to A., and that he and his heirs <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>might distrain, which would pass the fee. In Co. Litt. 9 a, a grant to B. <em>et liberis suis et a lour Jieires, </em>the father and children took the fee jointly; which was directly in point with the present one. That the children were not parties to the deed, was an immaterial matter, since they were living at the time of the conveyance; Cro. Elia. 121, 884; 1 Leo..287. •'</p>

The defendant below claimed as tenant by the curtesy. It was supposed, on the part of the plaintiff, that under the deed Mary Shirlock took an estate for life, with remainder to the children in fee-simple. The words in the <em>habendum, </em>and <em>tenendum </em>designate the quantity of interest conveyed by the deed. The word <em>them, </em>relates to children, the last antecedent. To the children and <em>their heirs; </em>not to Mary Shirlock and her children, and to her and their heirs. As to the children and their heirs, it is an executory trust; and, contemplating Mary Shirlock as trustee, heirs, or words of inheritance as to her, are not necessary. • A trustee may take the legal estate for life, and the <em>cestui que trust </em>in fee-simple; <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Johns.%20494" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="10 Johns. 494">10 Johns. 494</a>; Brack<a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>enridge on Trusts, 2, 12,14 — 18, (5 Am.

Nor has the plaintiff ground to complain. True it is, that where a trust is created by will, a legal estate adequate to the purpose is to be implied; and had this trust not been created by deed, the life-estate given to the mother might have been sufficient to support the fee-simple trusts in favour of the children. In the interpretation of devises, to give effect to the general intent, the legal estate has often been extended by implication, and it has sometimes been supplied altogether; but as legal limitations are interpreted in equity as they are at law, such -implications cannot be made when the estate has been created by deed; as was ruled in Wykham <em>v. </em>Wykham, 11 East, 458; and 18 Ves. 395. But the interpretation put on the deed was a sound one, and the plaintiff recovered exactly the proportion to which ho was entitled.</p>
