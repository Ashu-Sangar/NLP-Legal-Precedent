      <em>March </em>24. This was an action of trespass <em>vi et </em>armis, <em>q. c. f. et de bonis asp. </em>commenced in June, 1842, which was referred by the defendants in December following. The arbitrators awarded no cause of action, and plaintiffs appealed. <em>After </em>the appeal, the narr. was filed in July, 1844, for entering the plaintiff’s close, and carrying away certain railroad iron. After plea pleaded, on$ of the defendants died, and the court compelled his executors to appear to the <em>sci. fa. </em>and plead. One of their pleas was, that the <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>cause of action survived against the co-defendants, and that they were not liable.</p>

This proceeding, it would appear, was based on the act of 1846, Pamph. Laws, 412, s. 6.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_1" id="ref_footnote_0_1">(a)</a> The plaintiffs then offered to file an additional count for the asportation of the same goods as were mentioned in the original narr. This amendment was not allowed by the court; the defendants objecting that the cause had been arbitrated before the passage of the act of Assembly, and the proposed count introduced a new cause of action. The same amendment had been offered and rejected, when the cause was called, and before the jury were sworn. The court (Krause, P. J.) directed a verdict for the defendants.</p>

The personal representatives of a deceased defendant were brought by <em>scire facias </em>on the record, though it is a horn-book principle that the surviving parties to an action are alone com<a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>petent to litigate it.

He chose, however, not to do so, but prayed leave to amend by filing a count on the statute <em>de bonis asportatis </em>simply, which was refused, and as we think, erroneously. The breach of close in this form of action is for the most part only nominal, though technically speaking it is the principal injury; the asportation, which is the substantial one, being laid only as matter of aggravation; for which reason it is that the existence and breach of a close must be proved. The amendment therefore would have introduced no substantive new cause of action; and it was therefore within the purview of the act of 1806. Though it was unnecessary, the plaintiff was nevertheless entitled to insist on it; for he had a right, preserving matter of substance, to lay his cause of action in as many forms as he pleased. The statute has since been repealed, and the amendment has consequently become indispensable.</p>
