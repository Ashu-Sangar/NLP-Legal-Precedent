In these accounts the plaintiff was debited with various amounts, which were credited to other furnaces, exceeding the credits 'for the iron delivered. Among these debits were items contained in the order above referred tó, entered in the account Nov. 11. To the reading of this order the plaintiff objected, that it was not addressed to any particular person, and that a part of the paper was cut off. The order signed by the plaintiff ran thus.</p>

They then offered an agreement to refer, signed and sealed by one of the present defendants in the firm of A. Shorb &amp; Co., with the report. In connection with this he offered to show that A. Shorb, who was a member of both firms, appeared before the arbitrators and agreed that they should settle all transactions relating to iron between plaintiff and the two firms, and that, with his consent, the accounts of defendants were submitted to them. The defendants then proved, that plaintiff had since brought an action against A. Shorb &amp; Co. in which .there had been an award; and they then objected to the evidence, that it was between other parties, and there had been a subsequent suit, and the court rejected it. The court also rejected-an agreement made by A. Shorb &amp; Co., signed by A. Shorb in the name of the firm. It was also proved that A. Shorb submitted these orders, and the accounts of the Hannah Furnace, to the arbitrators. The court also rejected A. Shorb’s receipts, signed A. Shorb &amp; Co., offered for the purpose of affecting Lyon, Shorb &amp; Co., through A. Shorb, with knowledge of the manner these orders were to be paid, and had been settled.</p>

Eight points were submitted to the court, which they answered distinctly, fairly, and with substantial correctness. These answers contain their own justification, and if any elucidation was required, it is contained in the general charge, to which the court refer in their answer to one of the points. The law is generally given to the plaintiff, but the court decline to assume facts with which the plaintiff has mingled his questions, leaving the determination of them, and the inferences and con Jusions in point of fact lawfully flowing from them, to the determination of the jury. "We see nothing, then, on which it is necessary to make a remark, except in relation to the individuality and separate and distinct responsibilities of different firms.</p>

      <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>The firm of Lyon, Shorb &amp; Co., has a distinct separate existence from that of A. Shorb &amp; Co., and each firm is as much individuated as an artificial person, as William M. Lyon and Anthony Shorb are in their natural capacities. It is of no consequence that the same individual is a member of both firm's; he can only bind either when acting within the range and scope of their proper business. There were other individuals mingled; some had interest in one, and some in the other. The different firms pursued and carried on different business at different places. And the acts of one could not be given in evidence against the other. All that a wide latitude of liberality on the part of the court, as to the acts and declarations of William M. Lyon and Anthony Shorb would justify, was allowed to go in evidence as against the firm of Lyon, Shorb &amp; Co. But as the plaintiff had large dealings with the firm of A. Shorb &amp; Co., and had, and I believe still has, suits in which these can be settled, some things were necessarily excluded by the court, as belonging exclusively to the transactions of the firm of A. Shorb &amp; Co. The plaintiff had a full trial; we do not perceive any injustice was done him, or that the court committed any error.</p>
