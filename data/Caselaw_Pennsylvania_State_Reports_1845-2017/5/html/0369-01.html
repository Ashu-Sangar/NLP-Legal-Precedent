Another witness proved he also had had a conversation with defendant, who said he would pay the debt. Neither of these witnesses had been employed by the plaintiffs in the matter.</p>

The plaintiff’s cause of action in this case rests entirely upon the deposition of a single witness, to whom the alleged promise was made, whoso testimony shows that he had no agency in the matter, no right to receive the promise,, and was under no obligation to communicate it, but an entire stranger to the transaction. For the plaintiff in error, it is contended that the loose declarations of a party casually made, having none of the sanctities of a contract, nor intended at the time to have been such, cannot create such an obligation as will maintain an action in the absence of any benefit to him who made the declaration, or any loss by him for whose benefit it is alleged it was made.</p>

By the bankrupt law, it is the <em>remedy, </em>not the <em>debt, </em>that is taken away. It requires no new contract to impose the moral obligation to pay. It only requires a removal of the impediment to an action. Any waiver of the effects of the certificate <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>of bankruptcy is enough. This waiver needs no new consideration. This obviates the difficulty suggested in some of the cases, of no consideration moving from the bargainee when the promise is to a third person. It is similar to a promise which waives the benefit of an insolvent law. Such promise is good, though made after suit brought. It cannot, therefore, be considered as the basis of the action, but as the removal of some impediment in the way of it; 4 Wash. C. C. R. 86; 3 Wash. C. C. R. 404. It is the mere waiver of a personal privilege, which any one may do at any time.</p>

Can it be material to whom, or before whom, it is made ? In Hassinger <em>v. </em>Solms, <a href="/serg-rawl/5/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Serg. &amp; Rawle 48" data-case-ids="1804450" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/5/0048-01">5 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 48</a>, the acknowledgment was made in the presence of one who had no direct interest in the question, yet it was held to be a binding promise. It is true the chief justice put it on the footing of a ratification of the act of the defendant’s agent as a substitute for previous authority; but still the ratification from which the promise proceeded was made in a casual conversation with a third person. It must be admitted that these conversations are ticklish things; for the parties do not always think it necessary to speak by the card. But when they speak deliberately, there is no reason why they should not be bound by what they say when they promise to do an act in advancement of natural justice.</p>
    <p id="b371-6" data-blocks='[["BL_371.8",371,[162,1939,1170,386]]]'>It was conceived to be a decisive fact in Hassinger <em>v. </em>Solms, that the promissor had received an important benefit from the payment of a part of the debt. The promise to pay, in the case before us, was made to the son of the defendant’s surety for the debt, and it differs from that case in no other particular. But why should it be less effectual than if it had been made to the father himself? The case seems to be substantially the same as Hassinger <em>v. </em>Solms, and to be ruled by it. Judgment affirmed.</p>
