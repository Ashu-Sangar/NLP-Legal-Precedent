The action was brought in 1845. The plaintiff then offered a written agreement, dated in 1832, signed by defendant’s testator, which, reciting the sales, witnessed that he thereby agreed that the statute of limitations should not be a bar against McCulloch’s recovering the amount of the sales, and having the sales settled as though there were no statute of limitations to interfere ; and he did thereby make the same agreement as to all other cases where the said McCulloch held deeds for property sold, by him as sheriff, to the testator.</p>

The question will be a difficult one when it will have to be met: at present, we are not compelled to decide it. To avail himself of the agreement, it was necessary for the plaintiff to state it specially in his replication. The defendant pleaded that his testator had not assumed within the six years, and the plaintiff, instead of confessing the matter of the plea and avoiding it, went directly to issue on it; and as the actual assumption within the alleged period was the point before the jury, it is not strange that he failed in his proof. As the court did not, however, rule the cause on the nature of the issue presented by the pleadings, it has been suggested that the judgment might be reversed on the actual ground of the decision, because, to have put it on the true ground, would have warned the plaintiff of his slip, and enabled him to amend his replication so as to give him the benefit of the agreement. But it is the business of the parties to <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>look <em>to the </em>pleadings, and not of tbe <em>court to </em>point out defects. Besides, we are here to decide as tbe pleadings are: not as they might have been. The assignment of error, therefore, is very plainly groundless. ' Judgment affirmed.</p>
