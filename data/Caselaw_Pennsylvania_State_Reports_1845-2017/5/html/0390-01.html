Stanfill <em>v. </em>Ilickes, 1 Lord Raymond, 280, simply decides that the landlord cannot distrain for rent due upon an expired lease, although the tenant remains in possession of the property under a lease at will, which at that date was undoubted law, but remedied afterwards by the passage of 8 Anne, ch. 14, &amp;c. Cook <em>v. </em>Cook, Andrews, 219, referred to by Bradby, in his Treatise on Distress, 83, by no' means sustains his abstract. That case, as reported, is simply thisr At Lady-day, (25th March,) 1735, a landlord let an estate at ¿675, for one year, ending at Lady-day, 1736, which rent was not paid. A fey days before the expiration of the lease, the tenant told his landlord he was not able to keep the estate, but desired as much of it as would pasture sixteen or seventeen cows for the benefit of his family, to which the landlord assented, and also leased to him the house and garden, without stipulating any sum to be paid as the rent. The tenant’s wife resided in the house, and pastured 'the cattle in differ-' ent places on the estate, from Lady-day, 1736, (25th March, 1736,) until January, 1737, when the tenant’s goods and stock were taken in execution. Under these circumstances a motion was made to the court to order the sheriff to pay the landlord the ¿675 rent, due-25th March, 1736, which the court refused, and said that the land<a id="p392" href="#p392" data-label="392" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*392</a>lord had not made out a case entitling him to relief on motion, inasmuch as he did not show how the first year’s rent was payable; nor whether any rent was reserved under the second lease. Taking the most favourable view of this case for the landlord, it is clear he was not entitled to his claim under the statute of 8 Anne, by which but six months are given to the landlord to distrain for rent due upon an expired lease, and in this case more than nine had elapsed, so that upon the first lease he clearly had no claim; and upon the second he had reserved no rent; consequently the court, on motion, refused to award him any; leaving him to his action for its recovery. Under the English, as well as our own statutes, there must be an existing tenancy at the time of the execution to entitle the landlord to claim his rent; but of the character of the lease by which that tenancy is created or continued, whether by renewal, holding over, or a new lease between the same parties, neither the language of the statutes referred to, nor judicial decisions upon them, (so far as I have been able to discover,) contemplate a difference. All that is required is, that the tenancy exist, and if the relation of landlord and tenant be once established, the right to distrain follows as a legal incident to it, and can only be taken away by that which amounts to its dissolution; as in the cases of Hodgson <em>v. </em>Gascoigne, 5 Barn. &amp; Aid. 88, (7 E. C. L. R.,) and Beltzhoover <em>v. </em>Waltman, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20417" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 417">1 Watts &amp; Serg. 417</a>. The lease in the case before us, for the year commencing 1st January, 1846, was between the same parties; no other interests were involved, and as between the parties to it, the right of the lessors to distrain is as undoubted as if the lessees had held over under the previous lease; which I suppose is not at this day questioned in Pennsylvania. The inquiry then follows, how much rent is the bank entitled to ? This depends upon the construction of the 83d section of the act of 16th June, 1836, which enacts, ‘ the goods and chattels being in or upon any messuage, lands, or tenements, which are or shall be demised for life or years, or otherwise, taken by virtue of an execution, and liable to the distress of the landlord, shall be liable for the payment of any sums of money due for rent at the time of taking such goods in execution. Provided, that such rent shall not exceed one year’s rent.’ This act has never received an authoritative judicial construction; and though the general phraseology is the same with that of the 21st March, 1772, it contains an additional provision not found in that law. The words ‘ and liable to the distress of the landlord,’ are added in the act of 1836, and if they have any meaning, it is, that the rent not only be due to the landlord, but <a id="p393" href="#p393" data-label="393" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*393</a>that, to entitle him to claim the money when the property has been taken in execution, he must also have the right to distrain. Now it is clear that no distress can be made until the rent is due and payable. It is true, an inveterate custom extending the right of the landlord to rent up until the date of the levy, though in the middle of a quarter, prevailed in this state, and that too, as is said by Chief Justice Gibson in Lichtenthaler <em>v. </em>Thompson, <a href="/serg-rawl/13/0157-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="13 Serg. &amp; Rawle 157" data-case-ids="1814016" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/13/0157-01">13 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 157</a>, ‘ contrary to the evident intent’ of the act of 1772, to such an extent as induced the court to lend it a judicial sanction in West’s Administrator <em>v. </em>Zink, <a href="/yeates/2/0274-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Yeates 274" data-case-ids="812656,812676" data-case-paths="/yeates/2/0274-01,/yeates/2/0274-02">2 Yeates, 274</a>, and subsequently in Binns <em>v. </em>Hudson, <a href="/binn/5/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 Binn. 505" data-case-ids="1793645" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0505-01">5 Binn. 505</a>. Under the act of 1836, however, the plea of a long established custom could not be so successfully urged; and containing as it does the provision that the rent be due, with the additional one, that the property levied in execution be liable to distress before the landlord shall effectively claim his rent, I prefer giving to this law a commonsense construction, and saying, that the legislature meant what they said, and that the landlord under it cannot claim rent from the sheriff unless he can distrain for it, which he cannot do before it is due and payable. Upon this construction, there was nothing due to the bank and Haldeman, under the lease commencing 1st January, 1846. The first quarter was paid, and the time for paying the second had not arrived when the levy was made upon the defendants’ property, consequently no part of that time should fall within the year allowed by law, unless it is necessary that it should be embraced, as part of the only period to which the lessors are entitled to rent; which the current of authority, commencing with Dod <em>v. </em>Saxby, 2 Strange, 1024, and coming down to Ege <em>v. </em>Ege, <a href="/watts/5/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="5 Watts 134" data-case-ids="1844070" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0134-01">5 Watts, 134</a>, clearly show is not the case. The landlord is entitled to one whole year’s rent, if that much be due; and this too, as is said by Judge Rogers, in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court in Ege <em>v. </em>Ege, ‘ without regard to the time the lease commenced, or the time of the sheriff’s sale.’</p>

In the view we take of the second objection raised by the execution creditors against the, landlord’s claim, it might not be necessary to say, whether the Statute admits of a different interpretation than that assigned to fhe act of 1772, but this point seems to be settled by the case of Morgan <em>v. </em>Moody, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20335" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 335">6 Watts &amp; Serg. 335</a>. Apart, however, from this, the determination in Ege <em>v. </em>Ege, <a href="/watts/5/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="5 Watts 134" data-case-ids="1844070" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0134-01">5 Watts, 134</a>, and Richie <em>v. </em>McCauley, 4 Barr, 471, settled that the year’s rent to which the landlord is entitled under the statute, is not necessarily to be confined to a year ending on the day of the sheriff’s levy. Although the reasoning of the Chief Justice in Lichtenthaler <em>v. </em>Thompson, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%20159" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="13 Serg. &amp; Rawle 159">13 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 159</a>, would seem to restrict the landlord’s claim to the last year, where two or more years’ rent remains in arrear at the time of the levy, (though the case was decided on another ground,) yet where, as here, there is but one year <em>actually </em>due, there is nothing in the fact that another year has commenced' to run, and a part of the rent accruing during its pendency been paid, that ought to deprive the lessor of the benefit of the statutory provision. Though it should be admitted, that, as is said in Dod <em>v. </em>Saxly, 2 Strange, 1024, the object of the statute is to secure the landlord a year’s rent, and to punish him for his <em>laches </em>in suffering more to be in arrear, yet, I repeat, in the present instance, the lessors do not appear to have been guilty of such laches. The Court of Common Pleas was therefore right, in apportioning the proceeds in court in payment of the rent due on the 31st December, 1845. Decree affirmed.</p>
