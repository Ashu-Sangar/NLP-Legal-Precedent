The fact was, the landlord obtained the whole amount of the levy for arrearages of rent. [G-ibson, C. J. — That is matter of replication; the surety is not bound to set out more than the principal; the levy is <em>prima facie </em>satisfaction.] The proceedings against the principal and his bail are concurrent, and certainly there should be some averment of satisfaction.</p>

The amount of the judgment in the original action having been made on the <em>fi. fa., </em>by a sale of the defendant’s goods, and in the hands of the sheriff was a substantial satisfaction of the recognisance of bail for stay of execution. Milliken <em>v. </em>Brown, <a href="/serg-rawl/10/0188-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Serg. &amp; Rawle 188" data-case-ids="1811143" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/10/0188-01">10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 188</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Rawle%20392" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Rawle 392">1 Rawle, 392</a>. Where the sheriff returns that he has sold goods to the amount of' a certain sum, by virtue of an execution, he is liable for the same. The utmost the defendant below was liable for, if his.affidavit was true, was the costs of the <em>scire facias.</em>
