In the case at bar, the sheriff did not have the property appraised on the writ of <em>fi. fa., </em>but returned a levy on the property therein described. The plaintiff issued a writ of <em>vend, exponas, </em>upon which an appraisement was returned, in bulk or in the mass, at $577. The sheriff also returned that he exposed the property to sale, and that it did not bring two-thirds of its appraised value, with a bond of the plaintiffs, in error to him under the provisions of the said act. In that bond it is recited in the condition that the property levied upon had been appraised according to law; '&amp;e., and was delivered back to the defendant, &amp;c.

But aside from these considerations there is something like a fraud practised upon the surety in the bond. It is stated that the property taken in execution was appraised according to law. Now that was a false suggestion undoubtedly, and in a matter which I think will be shown, in examining another point, material to the surety. It was a false suggestion, because the law required the property to be appraised'on the <em>fi. fa., </em>and no law authorized them to be appiraised on the <em>vend, exponas. </em>It was a false suggestion, because the law required a schedule of the property levied upon and appraised to be returned with the <em>fi. fa., </em>which was not done either on the <em>fi. fa. </em>or <em>vend, exponas. </em>And the want of this paper was such a radical defect as to render the whole proceeding vicious and inoperative as against the defendant and his surety in the bond.

The learned judge observed to the jury, that there <em>“ </em>was something <em>like evidence </em>of the appraised value of every article except the black cow. But similitudes are apt to deceive, and the jury ought to have been governed by real proof, not its similitude. Two of the appraisers were called, Platt and Irwin. Neither of them pretended to recollect the appraised value of the articles. Irwin believed no regular list was made ; he kept a memorandum and went into the house and figured it out, as he said; did not give his memorandum to the sheriff. One Brown was called as a witness. He said that he was the plaintiff’s agent; that he went with the sheriff, made out a list of the articles, we presume, for the sheriff and appraisers. He said he had lost the paper; had hunted for it. He swore to the amount of the appraisement of a number of articles. Platt said he thought the list was given to the sheriff; ho or Frisch got it. Such is the evidence given to suppdy the want of the statutory evidence. Independent of the entire want of security and safety in the testimony of an individual casually present, as to the appraised value of a great number of articles after the lapse of years — which insecurity is more apparent from the fact that no one else, even those officially engaged in the transaction and under oath, recollected <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>any thing about the appraised value be allowed to supply thei|lace of the statutory proof in fact and in law no evidence! The paper alleged by Brown to have been made by him, would not have been evidence if, it had ’ts'enl preserved, because it was, no,t adopted by the appraisers, and retrained by the sheriff. If the sheriff had returned a regular appraisement and schedule with his wirifr, and it was lost afterwards in the office of prothonotary, by fire or untoward accident, it would be competent perhaps to supply its place by parol proof of its execution and loss. But the fatal defect here is, that the legal evidence never existed. It might, with almost as much propriety, be contended, that if an inquest was made,out, and the sheriff returned no inquisition on real estate, that ¿he defect might be remedied by giving parol proof of what the inquest fixed as the annual value.</p>

But I presume the sheriff thought he was not authorized to sell any thing but what he was commanded by his writ to sell. The record shows that there was no property in possession of the sheriff, or in the custody of the law. It had been redelivered to the defendant, and I presume it might have been levied upon by a subsequent execution, or lawfully sold by him. The peculiar office of a <em>vend, exponas, </em>as it regards personal property, is to enforce the sheriff to sell when he has returned a levy unsold for want of buyers, and to bring him into contempt for not selling; 2 Saund. 71 b, n.; <a href="/citations/?q=11%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%20304" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="11 Serg. &amp; Rawle 304">11 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 304</a>; and when it is supposed the -property returned levied will not satisfy the debt, the plaintiff may 'have a clause of <em>fi. fa. </em>added, to justify the levy and sale of property beyond what is described in the <em>vend. ex. </em>This practice shows that the sheriff is not authorized to sell by the <em>vend. ex. </em>beyond what is therein commanded to be sold. ,i(</p>

The bond was intended to secure the plaintiff, if, at the end of the year, property to satisfy the execution was not forthcoming. It was not necessary that there should have been an actual manual delivery into the hands of the sheriff of the property on the ground at the time of sale.

The error of the court was, in not telling the jury that the evidence was wholly insufficient. A surety is entitled to the protection of the law, and equity holds him discharged, when he who seeks to bind him does not observe the most exact good faith. What the law requires the obligee to do, must be performed with fairness and honesty. It was the duty of the sheriff, by express direction of the statute, to return the schedule. That was the criterion of value of the different articles to which the surety had a right to look; it was part of the appraisement. And that the appraisement was legally made, the surety was fully authorized and induced to believe, for it is so nominated in the bond. He could have had no apprehension that he could be compelled to abide, in its stead, by the shadowy recollection of a witness dimmed or obliterated by time. That was a risk which he did not assume by his contract. It requires no sharpness of mental vision to perceive the difference of hazard. In the one category the amount is certain-; in the other, subject to vicissitude, depending on the memory of a weak, unknowing, or perhaps dishonest witness; a difference that would startle any man.
