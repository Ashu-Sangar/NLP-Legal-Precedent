The defendant' pleaded non-assumpsit, and on the trial offered in evidence \u201ca true and faithful transcript from the docket entries,\u201d in the matter of the application of Alter, one of the plaintiffs, for a discharge as a bankrupt. In this were stated the petition and the decrees of bankruptcy and discharge, all of which preceded the commencement of this action. By this it also appeared that one Thompson was appointed assignee, but he was not the person to whose use this suit was marked.\nThe court (Eldred, P. J.) rejected the evidence, and there being a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff, this writ of error was sued out.\nJ. A. Fisher, for plaintiff in error.\nAlricks and McCormick, contra, were stopped by the court."
