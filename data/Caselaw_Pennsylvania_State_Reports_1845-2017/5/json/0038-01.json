Bohlen.\nTo'a scire fadas issued on a recognisance of bail, an affidavit by the defendant, stating that the plaintiff in the original action issued a fi. fa., whereupon a levy was made, and enough money collected by the sheriff to pay the debt, interest, and costs, in that case; a copy of the return being annexed, from which it appeared that the proceeds of the sale were greater than the debt, &c., was held to be sufficient; \u2014 an averment of a receipt in satisfaction is not necessary.\nThe defendant in error having obtained a judgment against Holahan the plaintiff in error entered into a recognisance for stay of execution. A scire facias having issued thereon, the defendant filed air affidavit of defence, stating, \u00abIn the original suit, wherein deponent became surety, the plaintiff issued execution, to wit: a writ of fieri facias, June Term, 1845, No. 155, whereupon a levy was made, and enough money collected by the sheriff to pay the debt, interest, and costs in that case; a copy of the sheriff\u2019s return to said writ is hereto annexed, but for greater certainty the deponent refers to the record of said original suit.\u201d\nCopy of the return. \u2014 \u201c Levied upon the personal property of defendant, June 4th, 1845, and sold the same at public sale, June 21st, 1845, for four hundred and eighty-two dollars.\u201d\nJudgment was thereupon entered, for want of a sufficient affidavit of defence.\nMarch 9.\nDunlap, for plaintiff in error,\nThe affidavit presented a primafacie case of satisfaction of .the debt.\nMcCall, contra.\nThe affidavit does not aver satisfaction. The fact was, the landlord obtained the whole amount of the levy for arrearages of rent. [G-ibson, C. J. \u2014 That is matter of replication; the surety is not bound to set out more than the principal; the levy is prima facie satisfaction.] The proceedings against the principal and his bail are concurrent, and certainly there should be some averment of satisfaction."
