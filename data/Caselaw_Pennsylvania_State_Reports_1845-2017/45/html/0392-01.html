The jury found the defendant guilty. The defendant’s counsel thereupon moved an arrest of judgment for the following reasons :—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b392-16" data-blocks='[["BL_392.12",392,[296,1666,1163,427]]]'>1st. Because the prosecutrix proved that the child, although it was begotten in Pennsylvania, was born in Allegheny county, Maryland; therefore the jury were justified in finding verdict for fornication, but not for bastardy. The Act of Assembly under which the maintenance is claimed, provides for cases where children are begotten in one county of the state and born in another, or begotten in a neighbouring state and born within the state of Pennsylvania; but in this latter case no fine is to be imposed. But for the birth of a child in Maryland, there is no provision, and consequently there can be no sentence.</p>

Clark. On the trial, the jury convicted the defendant in manner and form as he stood indicted: that is, for fornication and bastardy in Bedford county. The only thing that is before this court, or could legally be brought up by the <em>certiorari, </em>is the record. That includes the record of the trial, the indictment, and sentence. The opinion of the court and affidavits after trial are no part of the record, and not before us. Looking at the record, then, the only thing which we can look at, we perceive that the defendant was convicted of fornication and bastardy, and sentenced for the fornication only, without any reference to the bastardy with which he had been charged, and of which he was convicted. The record does not show that the infant had died before sentence, and hence there was no order of maintenance; nor any reason why there was not an order for lying-in expenses. We need not deal with the alleged reason <em>dehors </em>the record. The conviction is conclusive that the offence was committed in the county of Bedford. A court can never arrest a judgment on the ground that the evidence was not sufficient. That is a ground for a new trial only. The defendant should, in this case, have been sentenced for fornication and bastardy, and in addition thereto to pay lying-in expenses, and to give security to perform the order of maintenance which the court should have made. This not having been done, we must reverse this sentence, in order that the defendant may be brought into court and sentenced according to law.</p>
