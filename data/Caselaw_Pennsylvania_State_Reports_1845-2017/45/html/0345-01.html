Black, the plaintiff, sold a stock of goods to John B. Zimmerman and David Zimmerman, partners trading in the name of Zimmerman &amp; Co., for the consideration of $3200. In part payment, Zimmerman &amp; Co. were to deliver to Black “ obligations on a certain tract of land, situate in Madison township, amounting to $650.” The tract of land mentioned was at that time owned by Zimmerman &amp; Co., who had a parol contract with David Garland to purchase it. Garland was to give bonds for $650, which were the bonds referred to in the agreement between Black and Zimmerman &amp; Co. for the sale of the stock of goods. When Black was about delivering possession of the goods to Zimmerman &amp; Co., they had not obtained Garland’s bonds, and were unable to comply with their contract; for the contract between Zimmerman &amp; Co. and Garland, for the purchase of the land, was not to be executed, and bonds given until the 1st of April following (1859). Black refused to deliver possession of the goods until he obtained the bonds; and in order to get possession, Zimmerman &amp; Co. offered to give Black security for the delivery of the bonds on the 1st of April 1859. The agreement, on which this suit was brought, was then signed by Zimmerman &amp; Co. and Samuel Gutshall and John Shively, as securities, and Black then delivered the goods to Zimmerman &amp; Co. These were the admitted facts of the case, as proved by R. I. Hines and Daniel Garland, witnesses in the case. The contract between Zimmerman &amp; Co. and Garland for the sale and purchase of the land, was never executed: consequently no bonds were given by Garland or tendered by Zimmerman &amp; Co. to Black. It was admitted that the questions of defence, upon the facts recited, were matters of law for the court to decide, and that the verdict of the jury ought to be in accordance with the <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>instructions of the court upon the legal questions submitted by defendant’s counsel.</p>

In instructing the jury, that under our Statute of Frauds of 1855, the consideration of a promise or undertaking to pay the debt of another not appearing on the face of the promise, may be shown by parol; and in saying to the jury, “ Why, then, should we apply the English rule to the construction of our Statute of Frauds, which is not applicable to other cases ?”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b346-10" data-blocks='[["BL_346.8",346,[270,1297,1168,856]]]'>3. In saying to the jury, <em>“ </em>Apply these principles to the present case, and it is clear of difficulty, even under the ruling of the courts of England. The guaranty is dated on the 2d October, and agrees to furnish the plaintiff obligation to the amount of $650, for a certain tract of land situate in Madison township. But this is not the only written evidence of the consideration of the guaranty. On the 27th September 1858, five days before the guaranty, ^Zimmerman <em>&amp; </em>Co., by their written agreement, purchased from Black a stock of goods for $3200, and in part payment agreed to give the plaintiff obligations on a certain tract of land situate in Madison township, and bounded by land of George Ilohenschildt, George M. Loy, and others, said obligations amounting to $650.” No man of ordinary intelligence could doubt that the obligations mentioned in the papers of the 27th September and 2d October are the same. * * * * Now, in the absence of all parol evidence on the subject, the plain and' unmistakeable inference from the two papers is, that upon the guaranty of Gutshall and Shively, Black agreed to extend the time for the delivery of the bonds from 2d October to 1st of the following April.”</p>

This decision, although not satisfactory, finally became the settled law of England, with a qualification, which is well expressed by Lord Campbell in Powers <em>v. </em>Fowler, 4 E. &amp; B. 516, decided in 1855: “The agreement,” said his lordship, “includes not merely the promise or undertaking, but the consideration for that promise, without which it is not an agreement; therefore the consideration must be disclosed in the writing. But if it appears by the express terms, or by <em>necessary inference </em>from the terms of the writing, that the defendant’s promise is upon the terms of the plaintiff’s performing some condition, the performance of which will be a benefit to the defendant or a detriment to the plaintiff, then it appears in the writing that there is a consideration, and on the performance of the condition the plaintiff may sue.” Wightman, J., said : “All the cases agree that it is enough if the consideration can fairly be collected from the terms of the writing.” The construction placed upon the 4th section was not extended to the 17th section, under which it was held that the consideration need not be expressed.</p>
