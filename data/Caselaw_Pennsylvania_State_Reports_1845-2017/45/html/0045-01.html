Where a surety claims to be discharged from liability upon a note by reason of notice to the holder to sue the principal debtor, the proof of the notice which raises an equitable duty in the holder in favour of the surety, for the neglect of which to his injury he is discharged, is the preliminary evidence to show that duty, and to introduce evidence of its violation : and if that notice is not clearly proven, further evidence is unnecessary, and the holder is entitled to recover.</p>

The plaintiff declared in <em>assumpsit </em>on a promissory note, dated Lower Mount Bethel, March 23d 1839, for $17.50, payable to the heirs of the estate of Elizabeth Searles at her death, and signed by John Johnson, attorney, and John Wolleshlare. On the trial the plaintiff gave in evidence the note declared on, proving the death of Mrs. Searles, and that the plaintiffs were her heirs; and rested.</p>

Wolleshlare requested and urged the heirs to take these notes. Johnson expressed no particular unwillingness to give up these notes; Wolleshlare urged them to have these notes transferred to themselves or have the money collected; Johnson said there would be some difficulty in so doing, but if they wished it he wouldn’t object. The objection to collecting the money that Johnson spoke of was that it was after the first of April; I don’t recollect any other objection he spoke of.”</p>

      <em>Question. </em>— “ When Mr. Wolleshlare urged upon the heirs to have the notes transferred to themselves or to collect the money what, if anything, did he say as to being no longer responsible himself as surety upon Johnson’s note ?”</p>

      <em>Answer. </em>— “ As near as I can recollect he used language something like this or of similar import I should say — ‘ The note is out and the money is where you can make it perfectly secure to yourselves, and I am determined to stand no longer on the note, and you must proceed to collect it.’ I mean proceed to collect these notes; I mean the note on which Mr. Wolleshlare was security of course. In saying I meant these notes I referred to <a id="p47" href="#p47" data-label="47" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*47</a>the previous conversation as to the notes against Butz and others. I did not refer'to the note then that Wolleshlare required the heirs to collect from Johnson; I didn’t see any of these notes in the course of the conversation during the day. I heard Wol-leshlare say to Everhard before that several times, that he did-not think John Johnson perfectly secure. At those times he repeated the same request and that they should collect the money from John Johnson.”</p>

      <em>Gross-examined. </em>— “Wolleshlare suggested to these heirs that they should take this note of Butz from Johnson’s hands; he said he was ready to pay his own note at any time ; there was no proposition made at that time as to William Johnston’s note; William Johnson made a proposition to Everhard; I don’t know whether it was that day or not, that if such an arrangement was entered into he wanted Everhard to take this note; can’t say whether William Johnson was there that day or not; I may have testified when my deposition wras taken last time that William Johnson was present that day; when Wolleshlare said that they must collect their money, that ho at the same time proposed to go with them to Butz’s; I don’t think I swore so the last time I was examined; I swore that he proposed a plan by which they could get their money into their own hands, that they should take Butz’s note from Johnson; I said William Johnson made the proposition to Everhard that he should take his note, but whether it was that day or not I can’t say now; I can’t tell the pregise language that Wolleshlare used when he spoke of collecting the money; he told them to take those notes; this was one plan he proposed. The other was that they should have Johnson collect the money from Butz and hand it over to them ; I do not say that he directed the parties to sue Mr. Johnson; I recollect Mr. Wolleshlare made the remark that he supposed Butz could pay the money at any time; he gave no directions to have Butz sued; I don’t know that he gave any reasons for not suing Butz ; I heard no directions given to have Butz or Johnson sued. The funeral expenses at the store were settled at that time; I think Johnson paid Everhard $12 for taking care of Mrs. Searles ; I don’t know that either the Butz or Johnson note were called for at the time of this conversation; I didn’t see them; I do not recollect that Johnson said he had a year to settle in; I don’t know that Wolleshlare said he, Wolleshlare, had no money at that time, I don’t know, I may have said in my last deposition that William Johnston was by during a part of this conversation ; I can’t be definite about it; I stated in my last deposition that I thought I had no conversation with Everhard after this conversation with the heirs, but think now I did say something to Ever-hard about it afterwards; I don’t recollect that any one but these parties spoken of were present at this conversation ; I was absent <a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>a part of the time, but don’t recollect that I saw Esquire Huns-berger there ; Everhard’s wife was there; can’t say whether his daughter was in that room ; Frederick Searles, Esther Searles, Mr. Everhard were the heirs present; can’t say whether they were present all the time; they were there most of the day.”</p>

It is only by way of equity that he can be held to any duty to either of them. This happens when it clearly appears that one of them is surety for the others, and warns the holder to proceed to collect the claim without delay or he will hold himself discharged. This warning does in equity raise a duty on the part of the holder to the surety, and if it be neglected to the injury of the surety he will be discharged. The proof of this warning is therefore the preliminary evidence that is to raise the duty and introduce the evidence of its violation.</p>

The witness very evidently had not a dear idea whether the warning given applied to this note or to those held by Johnson; and surely warning, or the evidence of it, that requires a long and tedious analysis to show its application to the note sued on, cannot be regarded in equity as sufficient. It, and the .evidence of it, ought to .be so clear and distinct, that its meaning will strike the mind of the hearer at once and without argument. This does not at all do so; and argument in its favour only makes its sufficiency less clear. The court was right in declaring that this preliminary proof was not made out. We see no other question in the cause that requires discussion by us, and no error to the injury of the defendant below.</p>
