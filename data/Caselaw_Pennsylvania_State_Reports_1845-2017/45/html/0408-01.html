Toms never filed a collateral inheritance tax-bond, as required by the Act of the 22d of March 1841. It is also admitted that at the date of the last settlement of said Toms with the Commonwealth, there was a balance due the Common<a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>wealth of $1033.06, of which amount $944.41 is due on collateral inheritance tax, and $88.65 due on writs.</p>

    <p id="b409-12" data-blocks='[["BL_409.14",409,[147,1585,1170,378]]]'>But when we turn to the Act of 22d March 1841, P. L. 99, imposing the collection of the collateral inheritance taxes on the register, we find that the legislature did not rely on the general official bond of the register as a security for the performance of this new duty, but required a special bond for this purpose, and provided a mode to enforce the giving of it. It seems to us very plain, therefore, that the general bond is not intended to secure either payment of these collections or the giving of the special bond to secure them.</p>
    <p id="b409-13" data-blocks='[["BL_409.15",409,[146,1971,1168,205]]]'>Possibly the act intended these special bonds to be given only by registers then in office, and to leave the same duties of future registers to be secured by the general official bond; but this is not clear, and such has not been the practice under the law, and therefore it would seem to be not now allowable.</p>

According to it, it is not a duty of the register to collect these taxes until he has filed the special bond required by the act, and therefore his sureties in his official bond are not liable for such collections made by him, though of course he is himself liable.</p>
