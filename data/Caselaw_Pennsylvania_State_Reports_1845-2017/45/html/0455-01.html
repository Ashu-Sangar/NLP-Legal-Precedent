The severance of the engine and machinery, under the circumstances of the case, was within the restraining power of the court: First, because it was waste, such as a judgment-creditor is entitled to prevent by injunction as against his insolvent debtor. • Second, because it was an attempt to perpetrate a fraud upon a prior judgment-creditor. The bill, answer, ,and evidence disclose that the value of the property, as it stood with engine and fixtures in the mill, did not exceed the amount of the dower charged upon it, and complainants’ judgments ; that Wit-mer was a subsequent judgment-creditor; that Thoma, the owner, and others combined and confederated to deprive complainants of their priority of lien, and impair the security which the law gave them. The “ insolvency” is alleged in the bill, and admitted in the answer. The “ combination and confederacy” appear from the evidence of Meiley, Stager, and Borgner. There is no question that the purpose of the severance was to divest the complainants of the rights of lien secured to them by the law as prior judgment-creditors, and the payment of the judgment which, upon the sale of the real estate as it stood before the severance, <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>would be entitled to nothing. The defendants therefore meditated a -violation of the legal rights of the complainants, and a_ fraud in law and in fact. This case is plainly distinguishable from the cases cited by the plaintiff in error, which rule that “ preferences by judgment and execution are only a mode of paymentthat “ a conveyance by a debtor, in failing circumstances, to a creditor in payment of a debt, is not fraudulent,” and that “ creditors of the same insolvent debtor have a right to take their debt in anything the debtor is willing to pay.” But in the case in hand, the rights of the creditors are fixed by the act of the debtor, and the sanction of the law; the land with the fixtures is bound by the lien of the earlier judgment, and complainants have a legal right to be first satisfied out of its proceeds, and an attempt by the failing debtor to denude the property, and thus impair and lessen the security and value of the judgment, either for his own benefit or subsequent judgment-creditors, reversing the order established by the law, is in violation of the rights of the prior judgment-creditor, and a fraud upon the law: Reinheimer <em>v. </em>Hemmingway, 11 Casey 432; Roberts <em>v. </em>The Dauphin Bank, 7 Harris 71; Uhler <em>v. </em>Maulfair, 11 <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20446" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Wright 446">Id. 481</a>; Reese <em>v. </em>Addams, 16 S. &amp; R. 40. In Pennsylvania a judgment-creditor advances liis-money upon the immediate credit of the land. The title remains in the debtor, but the land is pledged to secure the creditor’s debt, in pursuance of the provisions of law. The debtor cannot alienate so as to discharge the lien of the judgment, and if he cannot alienate the whole he can have no right to alienate part.</p>

The remedy by estrepement for waste, in favour of a judgment-creditor, by the Act of 1822, we know arises only after the lands bound by such judgment, shall have been condemned by inquisition, and does not extend to lands which have been extended and rental assessed, nor to lands before levy. But the preventive and protective power of a court of equity in Pennsylvania in 1863, in a case like the present, is not to be limited by the provisions of the Act of 1822, relating to writs of estrepement. This court has said in Stockdale <em>v. </em>Ullery, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20486" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Wright 486">1 Wright 486</a>, that “ the courts in granting injunctions are not restricted to ‘acts contrary to law,’ but may exercise this power to restrain acts contrary to equity also; equity being so much a part of the law of Pennsylvania as that the word law often means both law and equity, or either.” It is a well-settled fundamental principle of equity “ that Courts of Chancery grant injunctions against w'aste, to restrain acts against conscience, or the existing rights of others:” 1 Mad.

The case disclosed by the bill and answer is that of a plaintiff with judgments to a large amount against a defendant conceded to be insolvent, and the real estate on which these judgments are liens admitted to be insufficient for their security. It consisted of about forty acres in Union township, Lebanon county, with a steam grist and saw mill thereon, which mills contained a steam-engine, boilers, and other machinery necessarily connected and used together, essential to the working of said mills, and so annexed, fixed, and embedded in the structure of said mills as to be part of the freehold. The defendant admitted that he detached the steam-engine and converted it into personalty, for-the purpose of enabling certain of his creditors to levy upon it, and sell it in satisfaction of their claims. He claims to have done this on his own mere motion, and without confederacy with the creditors for whose benefit it was done; but he admits that they levied on it as personalty, and thus appropriated to themselves the benefits of his act, if they did not help him to perform it. They were subsequent judgment-creditors to the plaintiff in this bill, and had no legal right to be first paid out of the debtor’s property. If the real estate, before severance of the engine, -was inadequate to secure prior lien-creditors, it is manifest the severance, which sensibly impaired the value of the estate, was a great wrong done to them. The learned judge pronounced it a palpable fraud and an illegal preference of creditors. When the principle was pressed upon him, that equity will not ordinarily restrain the sale of chattels, after they have been severed <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>from tbe freehold, he put himself distinctly on the ground that the acts of Thoma were a fraud in law, “intended and calculated to give a later judgment-creditor an advantage over an earlier one, and that all the parties defendants wrere participants in the fraud, and cannot take advantage of their own wrong.”</p>

    <p id="b462-9" data-blocks='[["BL_462.7",462,[239,998,1166,427]]]'>The abstract right to sever fixtures is, unquestionably, inherent in the full dominion over land which ownership confers, and though an insolvent owner may not assign his property in trust, so as to create a preference among his creditors, yet he may, by encumbrances confessed or by absolute and direct conveyances, prefer one creditor to another: Worman <em>v. </em>Wolfsberger’s Executors, 7 Harris 61; Breading <em>v. </em>Boggs, 8 Id. 37; Covanhoven <em>v. </em>Hart, 9 Id. 495; Uhler <em>v. </em>Maulfair, 11 Id. 381; Siegel <em>v. </em>Chidsey, 4 Casey 279; York County Bank <em>v. </em>Carter, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20446" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="2 Wright 446">2 Wright 446</a>.</p>

This is the real question here. The wrong complained of consisted not so much in converting the fixtures to the use of subsequent creditors, as in the damage done to the freehold, which was the only security of the prior creditors. When their liens attached, the engine formed part of the freehold, and was bound by them. Although a judgment-creditor has no estate in the lands of his debtor, it cannot be said that he has not an interest which may be defended. He may seize them in execution, and then our statute entitles him to estrepement to stay waste, and on conversion of the land into money, he has a right, secured by another statute, to take the money in preference to the owner or encumbrancers, however meritorious, who are subsequent to himself. In Gray <em>v. </em>Holdship, 17 S. &amp; R. 415, it was held that a mechanic’s lien against a brewery in which a boiler had been distrained for rent, and severed, would hold the boiler, as against a purchaser of it, as a chattel. In Voorhees <em>v. </em>Freeman, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20119" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 119">2 W. &amp; S. 119</a>, and Pyle <em>v. </em>Pennock, Id. 390, the detached rolls of a rolling-mill were held to be part of the freehold, and bound by the lien of a mortgage; and in Hoskin <em>v. </em>Woodward, ante 42, it was held that a mortgage of a machine-shop included a lathe therein erected, and that a sale <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>and removal of the lathe was such a violation of the rights of the mortgagee, that he might follow and recapture it from the purchaser. “ He may even treat it as personalty as against the wrongdoer, for the wrongful act cannot be alleged by the wrongdoer as a measure of shelter for himself,” said the chief justice, in delivering the opinion of the court.</p>

    <p id="b463-5" data-blocks='[["BL_463.5",463,[143,783,1161,298]]]'>The mortgagee has no estate in the land, any more than the judgment-creditor. Both have liens upon it, and no more than liens. This was expressly asserted in Asay <em>v. </em>Hoover, 5 Barr 35, and has been substantially, if not expressly, affirmed in many eases: Rickert <em>v. </em>Madeira, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Rawle%20228" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="1 Rawle 228">1 Rawle 228</a>; Edmonson <em>v. </em>Nichols, 10 Harris 79; Wilson <em>v. </em>Shoenberger’s Executors, 7 Casey 299.</p>
    <p id="b463-6" data-blocks='[["BL_463.6",463,[141,1083,1163,900]]]'>As to estate and interest, then, no substantial difference exists between these two classes of creditors: diversities that do exist, have reference to the extent and duration of the liens and the remedies for enforcing them. If a mortgagee have an interest in the mortgaged premises, which may be defrauded by a severance and sale of a fixture, so we may conclude, has a judgment-creditor. The fraudulent character of the severance must be determined by the circumstances of each ease. So long as the debtor uses his estate for its ordinary purposes, according to its nature, he cannot be impeached for fraudulent waste. As was said in Hoskin <em>v. </em>Woodward, he may sell, in the usual way, the “ lumber, firewood, coal, ore, fruit, or grain,” produced by his land, without violating the rights of lien-creditors. But as to machinery, which is a constituent part of a mill or manufactory, to the purposes of which the building has been adapted, and without which it would cease to be such a mill or manufactory, the rule is different. To dismantle such an establishment on the eve of bankruptcy is to destroy its customary use and to defraud lien-creditors, whether by judgment or mortgage. Though not waste under our statute, it is so at common law, and, like other acts contrary to law, is restrainable in equity.</p>

This is true as to personal property, and for this reason, that the execution only, and not the judgment, is a lien on chattels. English cases were cited to show that it is true also as to real estate in England, and for precisely the same reason that a judgment there is no lien on land. It is the execution which establishes the legal relation between the creditor and the debtor’s land, as here it is the execution, which estab<a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>lishes the legal relation between the creditor and the debtor’s goods. But our statutes bring judgment-creditors, as the contract of mortgage brings mortgagees, into direct relation with the debtor’s lands, and because the law creates the relation, equity will protect it — will protect it not from such reasonable use and enjoyment of the lands by the owner as are usually incident to unencumbered ownership, but will protect it from such wanton and injurious acts as are of the nature of waste.</p>
