    <p id="b188-8" data-blocks='[["BL_188.6",188,[264,811,1161,85]]]'>2. The promise, if any, is to pay the debt of another, and, it not being in writing, is void under the Act of 26th April 1855.</p>
    <p id="b188-9" data-blocks='[["BL_188.7",188,[264,896,1162,129]]]'>The answer to the first point is simple: the property did come back to him, and he sold it to another. The court were therefore right in negativing this point.</p>
    <p id="b188-10" data-blocks='[["BL_188.8",188,[263,1025,1160,684]]]'>In Leonard <em>v. </em>Vredenburgh, <a href="/johns/8/0029-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Johns. 29" data-case-ids="2134339" data-case-paths="/johns/8/0029-01">8 Johns. 29</a>, and in Farley <em>v. </em>Cleveland, 4 Cowen 432, Kent, C. J., and Savage, C. J., thus characterize the class of cases not within the Statute of Frauds: “Where the promise arises out of some new consideration of benefit or harm moving between the newly contracting parties, or, as expressed by Mr. Roberts (Rob. on Frauds 232), if it spring out of any new transaction or move to the party promising upon some fresh and substantive ground of a personal concern to himself.” The marginal note to the last case expresses the decision and the principle in the following clear terms : “ Where a promise to pay the debt of a third person arises out of some new consideration of benefit to the promissor or harm to the promissee, moving to the promissor either from the promissee or the original debtor, such promise is not within the Statute of Frauds, though the original debt still subsist and remain entirely unaffected by the new agreement.”</p>
    <p id="b188-11" data-blocks='[["BL_188.9",188,[263,1710,1158,729]],["BL_189.1",189,[139,425,1167,207]]]'>These cases, and the principles decided by them, were cited and approved by C. J. Shaw, in Nelson <em>v. </em>Boynton, 3 Metcalf 401; Alger <em>v. </em>Scoville, <a href="/mass/67/0391-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Gray 391" data-case-ids="1973910" data-case-paths="/mass/67/0391-01">1 Gray 391</a>; and Fish <em>v. </em>Thomas, 5 Id. 45. And the rule is distinctly enunciated by the present Chief Justice of Massachusetts, in Jepherson <em>v. </em>Hunt, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Allen%20423" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Allen 423">2 Allen 423</a>. “The rule is well settled,” says the Chief Justice, “that where the leading object of a promissor is to induce a promissee to forego some lien, interest, or advantage, and thereby confer on the promissor a privilege or benefit which he would not otherwise possess or enjoy, an agreement made under such circumstances and upon such a consideration, is a new, original, and binding contract, although the effect of it maybe to assume the debt and discharge the liability of another.” The same doctrine is stated in 2 Parsons on Contracts, 4th ed., 306, who, in his Elements of Maritime Law, ed. 1862, p. 74, puts it in this form: “ Whenever the main purpose and object of the promissor is not to answer for another, but to subserve some purpose of his own, his pro<a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>mise is not within the statute, although it may be in form a promise to pay the debt of another, and although the performance of it may incidentally have the effect of extinguishing the liability of another.” See Burge on Suretyship 26; Addison on Contracts 38.</p>

J. Comstock, delivering the majority opinion of the Cdurt of Appeals, as intending to overrule or question the deci-cisions in 8 Johns, and 4 Cowen or the cases in Massachusetts, and the case itself is distinguishable from the one before us in this, that the promising party derived no benefit from the release of the bond in which he had no interest.</p>
    <p id="b189-7" data-blocks='[["BL_189.5",189,[141,944,1168,601]]]'>Here, then, was a lien or claim upon property in which Arnold had an interest, and it was a benefit to him that no proceedings should take place on the mechanic’s lien held by Stedman, whilst his ejectment was in progress. The consideration, therefore, as regarded Arnold, of his promise, was the benefit or advantage to himself arising from Stedman relinquishing proceedings upon his mechanic’s lien. The consideration did not proceed from or to the debtor, but was an entirely new and fresh one between Arnold and Stedman, and was a new, original binding contract; Arnold’s object being not to answer for the debt of Barrett, but to subserve a purpose of his own. We do not, therefore, think the Act of the 26th April 1855 includes this case, and if such a defence were available, it would only sanction what would be a gross fraud on the part of the plaintiff in error.</p>
