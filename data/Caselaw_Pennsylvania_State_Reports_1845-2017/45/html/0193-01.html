This act provides that “the official acts, protests, and attestations of notaries public, certified according to law,” &amp;c., shall be received and read in evidence as proof of the facts therein stated, &amp;c. But is a certificate according to law, made three years and four months after the transaction occurred, without stating that it is certified from some record made at the time the transaction took place ? On the original protest there is no endorsement of notice being sent to any of the parties liable on the draft of July 25th 1857, nor does any cotemporary certificate of that fact accompany the protest. If the notary kept a “register of his official acts,” as the law requires him to do, he could have certified an extract from or copy of that, there would have been some evidence upon which to receive his certificate. But such evidence is not offered, and its existence will not be presumed in the face of the fact that the protest itself shows no such notice. There was no legal evidence of notice offered, and Starr &amp; Payne were entitled to notice, even though Latham, Tozer &amp; Perry were insolvent at maturity of the draft: Barton <em>v. </em>Baker, 1 S. &amp; R. 334; Gibbs <em>v. </em>Cameron, 9 Id. 201; Kramer <em>v. </em>Sandford, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0328-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 328" data-case-ids="1856487" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0328-01">4 W. &amp; S. 328</a>. Protest should be noted on the day that it is made, even if not drawn out in form: Story on Bills, § 278; and the certificate should show that a register thereof was made at the time.

If in payment, that ends all controversy in this suit. Was it taken in payment? It was sent to Starr &amp; Payne to “ retire” the first <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>draft. Sanford &amp; Co., in the letter of November 4th 1857, to Latham, Tozer &amp; Perry, speak of it as sent “ to take up your acceptance which we had discounted for them” (Starr &amp; Payne). After the protest of second draft, Sanford &amp; Co. write to Latham, Tozer &amp; Perry about it, but offer no word of evidence that they ever, until 1860, made a claim of a right to recover on the first draft, but, on the contrary, they first bring suit on the second draft, and it is pending from April 21st 1859 till- December 26th 1860, before they make an attempt to recover on the first draft. Why they drop the second draft and resort to the first, may perhaps appear in the course of this argument. All of these circumstances certainly point very strongly to the idea that the second draft was taken in payment of the first. If taken only as collateral, Sanford &amp; Co. were just as much hound to use due diligence in pursuing its collection, in order to charge Starr &amp; Payne, as if taken in payment. Starr &amp; Payne are but the endorsers of the draft, and as such entitled to due and legal notice of non-acceptance and non-payment, and a failure to give them notice of either, will both in law and equity relieve them from the payment of either draft. If, by due diligence, Sanford &amp; Co. could have collected the second draft from McChesney &amp; Bro., and they failed either to use that diligence, or to notify Starr &amp; Payne that it was not paid for more than a year after it matured, or until April 1859, have they not been negligent of their duty to an extent sufficient to discharge the endorsers, and had we not a clear right to show that the draft could have been collected from McChesney &amp; Bro. during that time ? The letter from McChesney &amp; Bro. to Sanford &amp; Co., shows that after acceptance, the draft of October 26th 1857 was sent directly to them, and there is not a particle of testimony to show that Starr &amp; Payne ever saw it afterwards, or had any notice in relation to it. The charge of the court and bill of exceptions show that the testimony of Tozer was read without objection. Starr &amp; Payne then had no notice of the time or manner of the acceptance by McChesney &amp; Bro., and we contend that the acceptance was insufficient, improper, and not according to the tenor of the draft, and that it was equivalent to a non-acceptance by McChesney &amp; Bro., of which Starr &amp; Payne should have had notice. The bill is drawn on McChesney &amp; Bro., and of that fact Starr &amp; Payne had notice. It was accepted by McChesney &amp; Bro. McChesney &amp; Bro., agents, were not the men on whom the bill was drawn, and it was a plain notice to Sanford &amp; Co. that they were not doing business in their own names, and that the collection of the bill might be doubtful. A fact which, if known to Starr &amp; Payne, might have put them on their guard, and enable them to procure other and better security for their debt, either from Latham, Tozer &amp; Perry or McChesney &amp; Bro. <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>“ A failure to procure a proper acceptance of a bill, will discharge any party to the bill who could be injured by such nonacceptance, unless notice be given:” Story on Bills, §§ 227, 240 and note 4; Id. 241-252; <a href="/us/19/0572-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Wheat. 572" data-case-ids="11731081" data-case-paths="/us/19/0572-01">6 Wheat. 572</a>.</p>

The learned judge dissented from this view, inasmuch as there was no evidence whatever to show that it had been taken, either in payment of the note in suit or as collateral to it. We fully concur in this view of the case. It was therefore neither a set-off nor satisfaction in the ease trying. If damage has been sustained by Starr &amp; Payne, on account of the paper, they must seek redress, if any there be, in some other form; it cannot be had under the evidence, in the mode attempted here.
