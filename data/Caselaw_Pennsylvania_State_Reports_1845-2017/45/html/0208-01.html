If not, then a contract to carry beyond such points would seem to be invalid, unless it can be maintained that having contracted, they are estopped from themselves setting up their inability lawfully to enter into the contract they have made. And yet, if estopped from setting up its want of authority to enter into a contract which its agent has made in its behalf, it might indefinitely enlarge its powers, and clothe with the authority and power of the law that which it has done in the very teeth of express provisions of law.

It is believed the discussion of this question is not necessary for the purposes of this case, but where such a contract is relied upon, it must either be shown to have been expressly made, or its existence must he irresistibly implied from attending circumstances. It cannot be implied from the receipt of goods marked for and intended to be transported to a destination beyond the terminus of the road. Even the common law interprets such facts to imply only a contract safely to carry to the terminus, and then to deliver to a forwarder beyond that point: Garside <em>v. </em>The Trent and Mersey Navigation Co., 4 Term Rep. 581; Ackley <em>v. </em>Kellog, 8 Oowen 223 ; Maybier <em>v. </em>South Carolina Railroad Co., <a href="/scl/42/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Rich. 240" data-case-ids="8485124" data-case-paths="/scl/42/0240-01">8 Rich. 240</a>.

But if we are in error in the Anew Ave have taken, and the court should hold that the liability of the Pennsylvania Railroad Company continues until the passenger and his baggage should reach Cincinnati, then it becomes necessary to inquire into the .-.xtent of the company’s liability for the baggage of plaintiff. For Avhat articles can plaintiff recover, as lost baggage, under the circumstances of this case ? The recovery must be limited in this instance to the value of his wearing apparel, and that as a general rule, the term “ baggage” only includes those articles of wearing apparel, comfort and personal adornment, which are reasonably requisite for the traveller’s personal use, during the period of his intended absence; and the jury must determine, under the instruction of the court, what may be regarded as reasonable baggage, and in so doing, they must consider the length and object of the journey; and the habits, taste, and condition in life of the traveller. Such a rule, while it commends itself to reason and common sense, has been recognised by the courts: Parmalee <em>v. </em>Fisher, 22 Illinois 212; Jordan <em>v. </em>Fall River Railroad, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Cush.%2072" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="5 Cush. 72">5 Cush. 72</a>; Woods <em>v. </em>Devier, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Ill.%20750" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="13 Ill. 750">13 Ill. 750</a>; Debbie <em>v. </em>Brown, 12 Geo. 217. The money plaintiff claims to have lost, Avas not designed to be used for his personal expenses, but in thelanguage of his brother, upon whose testimony he relies, he intended “with this money to buy sheep-skins.” With as little propriety we argue, could a watch, chain, key, and seal, of the value of $ 130, and a ring of the value of $30, be regarded as part of the personal luggage of one in the plaintiff’s circumstances departing upon such a journey, nor can it be believed that a carpet-bag in a baggage-car was a place of safe deposit for such articles. At least it must be said that it was incumbent upon plaintiff to have explained why he carried them, and why he carried them in such a Avay. But upon these points he offered no testimony. In Hutchings <em>v. </em>The Western Railroad Co., 25 Geo. 61, the court held that a passenger has the right to carry personal baggage, but not to carry large sums of bullion without paying freight therefor.

Nor need we inquire whether the defendants had power to contract for the carriage of the plaintiff and his luggage beyond the terminus of their railroad. Conceding that they had, the evidence is very satisfactory that they did not. The plaintiff took passage at Philadelphia for Pittsburgh, and thence for Cincinnati. The carpet-bag, for the loss of which, with its contents, this suit was brought, was offered by him as his baggage, and was received as such. There is no pretence that it was offered or taken as freight. Nothing was offered or paid for its carriage apart from what was paid for the plaintiff’s own carriage as a passenger.

They were under no obligation to carry the plaintiff beyond the termination of their route, or to transport his luggage. It is true, they received the fare for the whole distance from Philadelphia to Cincinnati, and if that were all, it might raise a presumption of an agreement to carry over the entire route between the two cities. But contemporaneously with the receipt of the fare, and as evidence of the contract into which they entered, they gave to the plaintiff a ticket, informing him that they assumed no responsibility for his carriage, and of course for the carriage of his baggage, beyond Pittsburgh. They notified him that they acted only as agents for the carriers, whose route extended westward from Pittsburgh, and not at all for themselves. With this express disclaimer of personal liability, there is no possibility of implying an engagement. It is not to be doubted that the defendants could act as agents for a connecting railroad line, and if they could, the contract for carriage between Pittsburgh and Cincinnati was with the principals of the defendants, and not with themselves. Their own engagement was performed when they had transported the plaintiff to Pittsburgh, and delivered his baggage to the carriers on the connecting railroad beyond, leading to Cincinnati. It is settled in this state that a carrier may limit his responsibility even upon his own route, by a general notice that the baggage of a passenger is at the risk of the owner, provided the terms of the notice are clear and explicit,, and provided the notice is brought home to the employer: Beekman <em>v. </em>Shouse, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Rawle%20189" class="citation" data-index="41" data-cite="5 Rawle 189">5 Rawle 189</a>; Bingham <em>v. </em>Rodgers, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20500" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 500">6 W. &amp; S. 500</a>, and Laing <em>v. </em>Colder, 8 Barr 484. He may not, however, release himself from responsibility for want of ordinary care. Here, however, was no attempt by the defendants to limit their responsibility as common carriers. There was nothing more than an express refusal to assume an additional and unusual liability, a careful guarding against the implication of a contract, which, without the notice, might have arisen from the fact that the passage-money for the entire distance to Cincinnati was here received: Fowles <em>v. </em>The Great Western Railroad Company, 7 Exch. 699.</p>
    <p id="b215-3" data-blocks='[["BL_215.4",215,[138,2102,1166,261]]]'>This is the whole case. The plaintiff breaks down in the beginning. He fails to prove that these defendants contracted to carry him and his baggage beyond Pittsburgh. His remedy, therefore, is not against them, but against the company which undertook for that portion of the route upon which the carpetbag was lost.</p>
    <p id="b215-4" data-blocks='[["BL_215.5",215,[291,2360,1009,81]]]'>Judgment reversed, and judgment for the defendants, , <em>non obstante veredicto.</em>
