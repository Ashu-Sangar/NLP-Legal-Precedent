When it was opened on the 8th of October by the bank at Hagerstown, it contained but $6095 — $3360 having been abstracted from the package, and a bundle, made up of newspapers cut to the proper size, substituted. The company was informed of the loss, and Mr. Bingham, the superintendent, on the 11th of October went to Hagerstown and gave his check to the cashier for the amount of the loss. When the check was given, the cashier of the bank gave Mr. Bingham his receipt for the $3360. The efforts of the company were then earnestly directed to ascertain by whom the money had been taken. Circumstances indicated a young man named Oliver B. Simmons, who was subject to occasional attacks of insanity, and who was then temporarily employed by the company, as the person who had taken the money. He was privately questioned as to his knowledge of the loss, and upon being assured that he would not be prosecuted if he told the truth about the matter, he confessed that he had taken the money from the package, at the express office in Harrisburg on the 8th of October, about one o’clock in the morning, that he took it home to his father’s house, and put it in a box, where it remained until October 13th, when he took it, except $45, to Wetzel’s Swamp, about two miles from Harrisburg, and burned it there. The amount of the sum burned was therefore, according to the confession, $8315. After this confession, Simmons, accompanied by four gentlemen, went to the place where he said he had destroyed the notes. A quantity of cinders and ashes were found, showing the character of the paper burned. There were also found a number of pieces of Hagerstown Bank notes, which were produced and identified at the trial. From the evidence on the trial it was shown that young Simmons, at the time he broke the package and took the notes, was in “one of his spells,” or fits of insanity, and it was also proved that after these attacks he had always a clear and distinct recollection of all that took place whilst his mind was under their influence.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b421-6" data-blocks='[["BL_421.6",421,[121,850,1170,386]]]'>“ The express company was liable for the loss, and on the 11th day of October 1860 paid it in full, and obtained a receipt. The notes by this payment became the property of the express company. The notes in the present case being all of the kind ordinarily issued by banks, are payable on demand, and a demand must be proved, by showing that they were presented at the place of redemption, or the want thereof accounted for. The excuse for non-presentation is, that the notes were destroyed. On the truth of that allegation this case turns.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b421-7" data-blocks='[["BL_421.7",421,[119,1238,1173,986]]]'>“ The time was, in England, that if a man lost the seal from his bond, it was rendered invalid, and he lost his debt. After-wards this was amended by judicial decision. Still a proferí of the instrument was considered indispensable, until in process of time this was dispensed with where the party averred, and was prepared to prove that it was lost, or destroyed. It is now clearly settled, in regard to instruments not negotiable, that proof of loss will dispense with production ; and even in the ease of negotiable paper the party would be permitted to recover in case of its destruction, or on proving it lost, and tendering a sufficient indemnity. I do not consider that there could be a recovery on <em>lost </em>bank notes, as they are designed to pass from hand to hand as cash, and the bank is bound to pay them on presentation to whoever holds them at the time. It may be possible that if the denomination, date, letter, and number could be described, the loser might recover on tendering an indemnity, but it would certainly require a full and accurate description. Where they are wholly destroyed, so that they never can be presented or claimed from the bank by any one, the law' is otherwise. The holder is not to lose and the bank to gain the whole amount of the notes when their total destruction is clearly established — when it is made indubitably to appear that they are entirely consumed by fire, or irretrievably sunk in the depths of the ocean.</p>

It is also proved that Simmons passed or held in all $45, and he testified that all the remainder were burned. That fact depends on the truth of his testimony. If only <em>part </em>were destroyed, there can be no recovery, as the subject would be left in total uncertainty. You might doubt whether he had burned the half,, the third, or two-thirds. You must be convinced that <em>all were, entirely </em>destroyed, so that they never can circulate, or be presented to the bank.]</p>

In the former case, you would distrust him on account of moral obliquity; and in the latter, from want of memory, perverted judgment, or the imagining of matters which never existed, as is often the case with the insane, and one of the evidences of this malady. You will, on the other hand, bear in mind the statement of Doctor Curwin and his father, as to his memory during former attacks of the malady, and the corroborating facts proved by Mr. Wier and General Williams. The evidence of a felon, or an avowed accomplice, is sufficient in law to convict of the highest crime when substantially corroborated, and consequently should have some weight in civil proceedings. To pass on the credibility of witnesses is one of the most important functions of a jury; and it is peculiarly their province. The credibility of this witness, and the correctness of his statement, are submitted to your careful consideration.</p>

Where money is thus paid without suit, under a mistake of facts, it may very frequently be recovered back on the discovery of the mistake; but never where it is recovered by law. If a man should be called on for a debt, and had either forgotten its previous payment or mislaid his receipt, on its subsequent discovery he might recover it back as money paid by mistake. The debt had been twice paid, and the other party could not hold it with a good conscience. If a recovery had been had at law, the money never could be recovered back without first getting clear of the judgment. In this case suppose the express company, after making payment, should have discovered that the money never had been delivered to it at Baltimore, but still remained in bank there for the use of the defendant, there cannot be a doubt of its right to recover, although paid to compromise <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>a claim for damages arising out of its non-delivery. [Had the destruction of this money been known before the company paid the bank, we cannot doubt of its right to resist payment. This case does not, however, turn precisely on those principles. The express company having paid the bank for this loss, becomes the owner of the money, and had it been subsequently found, could have presented the notes for payment like any other bearer, or used them for circulation in its business. It now sues as owner of the notes, and claims to excuse itself from presentation and demand by proving the destruction of the paper, and its consequent inability to present them. This we hold is a valid excuse ; and if the notes are <em>clearly </em>and <em>undoubtedly </em>proved to have been destroyed whilst owned by the express company, it can recover. It has been suggested that if these notes were destroyed, it was through the instrumentality of the plaintiff’s own agent, and should therefore be considered its voluntary act. A party cannot be visited with loss through the insanity of its servant, nor its rights destroyed through his felony. If one of two innocent persons must suffer through such an act, he must bear the loss who was so unfortunate as to employ the madman or felon. But in cases of that kind the employer cannot be treated as a <em>voluntary </em>spoiler.]</p>

This bond is proper, but probably could only avail the defendant in case of evidence being discovered hereafter, showing that the notes, or at least some of them, were not destroyed. There is scarcely a possibility of the bank ever being able to avail itself of the bond through the mere presentation of its paper, as it is conceded the number, date, and denomination of the respective notes are unknown. But should it come out that a portion had gone into circulation, it might be useful for it to hold an indemnity. Such facts are sometimes brought to light by testimony at an after day.

The plaintiff demands interest from the time of payment. This, we think, is inadmissible.

The bank was justifiable in withholding payment until it was proved that they were destroyed; and, under the circumstances, it would properly discredit the averment. The bank had also an interest in the paper for future circulation to the amount that it would cost to supply the place of the notes, and as it has had the benefit of <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>the plaintiff’s money for several years, tbe one may be set against the other.”</p>

It was the bank’s property, and the carrier was bound by law to deliver it to them. An agent or clerk of the express company stole $3360 from the package during its passage. It was the duty of the company to make good this sum to the bank. The bank could have recovered against them at law. When Colonel Bingham, therefore, on the 11th October, paid to the bank $3360 in settlement of the claim, he did only what the law would have compelled his company to do, and the bank received only what they were entitled in equity and good conscience to receive and retain. So far from being a payment in mistake of legal rights and duties, it was a payment in discharge of clearly ascertained legal rights and duties.</p>

The bank having received the value of the notes, had no further right to the notes themselves, and were bound to redeem them when presented, as they would redeem any other paper issued by them. Simmons, the company’s agent, had the custody of the notes, but he had acquired no property in them, for he had taken them from his employers feloniously. He was bound in law and conscience to return them to his employers, in whom the title had now vested absolutely; and whilst he retained the custody, he must be considered as holding in trust for them. <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>"Whatever of the notes he passed away was the company’s loss, and whatever he destroyed enured to their benefit, for it entitled them to claim,so much money from the bank as for destroyed notes of their issue.</p>
    <p id="b428-6" data-blocks='[["BL_428.4",428,[263,571,1181,1328]]]'>It is argued, that a wanton destruction by their own agent could give the company no right of action. To this we cannot assent. Even if a careless and unintentional destruction of bank notes by an agent, in the course of his duties, would not give the principal an action against the bank that issued them, a proposition which we do not mean to affirm, it is very clear that a wanton destruction by a faithless agent, not in pursuit of the* duties for which he was employed, but in gross violation of them, cannot be imputed to the company as their wrongful act. It was their duty to employ honest and faithful agents, and when in pursuit of their calling as common carriers, their agent failed to deliver all the money they undertook to deliver, they'were, as I have before said, clearly responsible to the bank for his negligence and fraud. But when, by settlement with the bank, the company had become the owner of the notes in question, it was a fraud on them, not on the bank, to surreptitiously destroy the notes. It was like a malicious destruction of any other property of the employer by an unfaithful servant. What right has the bank to profit by his frdud on his employers ? By what rule of law or of morals can they adopt his wrongful act and appropriate it to their benefit? Ordinarily an employer is not responsible to third parties for the wilful wrong of a servant, even in the course of his employment; but here was an act, the destruction of the notes, which was not in the course of the agent’s duties, which was not injurious to the bank, for if not destroyed, the bank was more certainly liable to redeem the notes than if they were destroyed, but which was a great wrong to the employers, and to nobody else. Now, to treat the bank as the injured party, and the express company as the wrongdoer, would be an extremely artificial view of .the case and a strange inversion of legal principles.</p>
    <p id="b428-7" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[266,1899,1168,506]],["BL_429.1",429,[152,396,1176,992]]]'>The real question in the ease was whether there was adequate evidence of the destruction of the notes. Upon general principles of law, no man loses his right either to real or personal property, or to a chose in action, by losing the evidence of it, but if he cannot produce the primary evidence, he is bound to account for its absence and to produce secondary evidence that shall be reasonably satisfactory to a court and jury. As long as a bank note exists, the bank is liable to redeem it in the hands of the bearer, and therefore it is necessary for a party who calls on a bank to redeem notes without producing them,- to prove something more than mere loss, because, though lost to the real owner, the bank remains liable to the finder. But if their destruction <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>can be shown, there is an end of the bank’s liability to some casual holder, and the owner may recover them. The cases are all cited in the argument, two of the best of which are Bullet <em>v. </em>The Bank of Pennsylvania, 2 Wash. C. C. R. 172, and Martin <em>v. </em>The Bank of U. S., 4 Id. 255, both of which were cases in which the owners of bank notes had cut them in twain, and lost one part and presented only the other part. The banks were held liable as for destroyed notes. In such cases the evidence is complete, for the part produced is sufficient to identify the note, and the mutilation and loss of half is the destruction of the whole for all legal purposes. The case most relied on for the plaintiff in error, is that of Tower <em>v. </em>The Appleton Bank, decided in the Supreme Court of Massachusetts in 1862, and reported in <a href="/mass/85/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Allen 387" data-case-ids="2098575" data-case-paths="/mass/85/0387-01">3 Allen 387</a>. “ There was evidence tending to show that the plaintiff left the bills in question in his trunk in his room, in a house in Chicago, which was burnt within an hour afterwards, and that no person entered the room after he left it, and that the trunk and its contents were burnt with the house.” This is all the account the report gives us of the evidence, and the court held it insufficient to prove destruction of the bank notes. The court intimated, that if “ the bills were shown to be actually destroyed beyond all question or controversy,” the bank rvould be liable, but such proof as was before them, they held insufficient.</p>
    <p id="b429-4" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[162,1389,1168,301]]]'>And so it is maintained in this case, that there was a defect of proof on the main point. On looking through it, we think the court could do no less than submit it to the jury, and we cannot conceive how it could have been submitted in a manner more clear and fair. The precise amount of notes burned was not fixed, except inferentially, but the jury had ample grounds for the inference they made.</p>
    <p id="b429-5" data-blocks='[["BL_429.5",429,[163,1691,1169,248]]]'>The witness, Simmons, was legally competent, notwithstanding his physical and moral infirmities, for he was called to testify against his interest. His testimony was referred to the jury with all proper cautions and instructions, and we have no right to presume that any more weight was given to it than it deserved.</p>
    <p id="b429-6" data-blocks='[["BL_429.6",429,[165,1948,1165,129]]]'>On the whole, we think the evidence of destruction was such as the court were bound to submit, and it having' satisfied the jury, it must satisfy us.</p>
    <p id="b429-7" data-blocks='[["BL_429.7",429,[164,2077,1166,128]]]'>It is said the <em>narr. </em>was not founded on a destruction of the notes, but this is a clear mistake. The destruction and cancellation of the notes is alleged as a substantive ground of recovery.</p>
    <p id="b429-8" data-blocks='[["BL_429.8",429,[831,2206,453,42]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
