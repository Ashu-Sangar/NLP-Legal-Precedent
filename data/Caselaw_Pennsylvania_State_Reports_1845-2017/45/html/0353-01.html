Again, it was argued that the property was sold on the judgment of Clark for purchase-money, against which the defendant could not claim exemption or demand an appraisement, and that consequently all claim by defendant under the Exemption Act is unavailing.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b357-7" data-blocks='[["BL_357.5",357,[110,1082,1172,1115]]]'>“ The first position is not sound, for under the ruling of our Supreme Court there is a distinction taken between a voluntary waiver by defendant, and cases excluded from the operation of the Act of 1849, by its terms, or the nature of the writ upon which the sale is made, when it precludes a separation or division of the property. Thus upon a mortgage defendant may claim against subsequent judgments, without demanding an appraisement and division of the property, because such demand would be nugatory, and disregarded by the sheriff on a writ of <em>levari facias: </em>Hill <em>v. </em>Johnston, 5 Casey 362. In McAfoose’s Appeal, 8 Casey 277, a judgment for a debt contracted prior to the Act of 1849, where defendant claimed the benefit of that act, was awarded the proceeds of sale against a senior judgment for a debt contracted after the passage of the Exemption Law. The reason why a debtor may not waive his right so as to give a junior judgment a preference to a prior lien, is that he cannot be permitted to interpose and discriminate between different creditors. If he preserves the position in -which the law places him, he is entitled to its benefits. If he attempts to place another in the situation intended only for his benefit, and that of his family, it is a perversion of the legislative intent which will not be tolerated, and the law appropriates, regardless of the debtor’s partiality or dictation. But this reasoning will not apply where some of the liens are excluded from the operation of the act, without the action of the debtor himself, nor has the principle been applied to such cases in the decisions we have cited.</p>

      <em>“ </em>In reply to the position that the real estate was levied and sold on Clark’s judgment for purchase-money, on which defendant could not claim under the Act of 1849, it may be answered that it wras also sold on Kyle’s judgment, against which defendant could claim exemption, for there -was a levy and sale returned <a id="p358" href="#p358" data-label="358" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*358</a>on both writs. The land was sold in three parts, by agreement, reserving to defendant all his rights which he might have under any circumstances under the Act of 1849. Purparts 2 and 3 sold for $360, a sum sufficient to pay the three judgments of Clark for purchase-money. These amounted to $359.71, including all costs, as appears by the appropriation returned by the sheriff, so that purpart No. 1, which sold for $150, could only have been sold on the execution of Kyle, by virtue of the agreement to sell the whole, reserving to defendant his right to claim out of the sale $300, or any part thereof. And that.he has a right to claim against the judgment of Kyle, cannot be gainsayed unless the execution of Clark, being in the sheriff’s hands and levied at the same time, deprives the defendant of his right to claim exemption against Kyle. But Clark’s writ ought not to produce this effect, when sufficient property was levied and sold to pay Clark’s judgments, independent of purpart No. 1, which produced a sum equal to that claimed by defendant. The claim of defendant must therefore prevail against the judgments of Kyle and Dunlap. But the subsequent judgment of Clark for use of Clever, being entered on a bond for purchase-money, must be paid out of the sheriff’s sale. The proviso to the 3d section of the Act of 1849, is very explicit ‘ that this section shall not be’construed to affect or impair this lien of bonds, mortgages, and other contracts for the purchase-money of the real estate of insolvent debtors.’ This prevents Heller, the defendant, from taking the fund in controversy until the judgment of Clark for use of Clever is first paid, it being for purchase-money, and protected by the proviso of the 3d section of the Act of 1849. After payment of the judgment of Clark for use of Clever, there would be a balance of about $28, which would be payable to Heller, the defendant, if his claim had not been withdrawn by his counsel. But after making claim under the Act of 1849, having the money, on his petition, ruled into court for appropriation, signing an agreement by his counsel, in connection with the counsel of Kyle, Dunlap, and Clever, submitting the facts upon which the appropriation rvas to be made, and appearing before the court, and arguing the claim of defendant against the judgment of Clark for use of Clever; after the argument of the respective counsel was concluded, and an intimation given by the court that the defendant could not take the fund against the judgment for purchase-money, although it was subsequent to the judgments of Kyle and Dunlap, the defendant’s counsel then withdrew the claim of his client under the Exemption Act.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b358-6" data-blocks='[["BL_358.4",358,[323,2248,1162,173]],["BL_359.1",359,[141,370,1170,1368]]]'>“ It is difficult to conceive the object in withdrawing defendant’s claim from the consideration of the court, after an intimation that he would receive the balance after payment of the judgment of Clark for use of Clever, unless it was to give the <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>fund to Kyle and Dunlap, and prevent the payment of tbe subsequent judgment for use of Clever. This would have been the proper appropriation, had no claim been made by defendant under the Act of 1849. The judgment-creditors would then have been paid according to their priority of lien. And the question is now presented, whether a defendant, after making claim, and prosecuting it until he has the opinion of the court, although not reduced to writing, that only a small part of it could be allowed, ean then withdraw it so as to affect other creditors, and change the entire appropriation. This, we think, cannot be sanctioned. The claim for exemption by defendant fixes the <em>status </em>of the other creditors. If he prefers his claim, and has not waived his right to do so in favour of any creditor, he is protected by the Exemption Act, except as to liens which are excluded from its provisions. If he declines to make claim, the law appropriates according to priority of lien, without reference to the Act of 1849. But the debtor cannot assign, transfer, or substitute another to his rights; and upon the same principle, he cannot in this case, after being disappointed in his expectations, through caprice or partiality, defeat one creditor and give it to another, by withdrawing his claim. We must appropriate the fund in court upon the facts as they existed when the money was ruled into court, and the case argued by counsel, and to permit a debtor, after he has discovered he can receive but a small part of his claim under the Exemption Act, to defeat a creditor who has defeated him, and require the court to appropriate as if his claim had not been made, might occasion collision between the debtor and senior lien-creditors, who would be interested in inducing the claim of exemption to be withdrawn, so as to secure the money to be appropriated, which would have been awarded to another not affected by the Act of 1849, had the debtor persisted in his claim.</p>

According to the record of the remaining judgments, the money would go to Kyle and Dunlap, whose judgments were entered on the same day, and not to Clark for the use of Clever, because this judgment was subsequent to those of Kyle and Dunlap, and although entered on a purchase-money bond, became a lien only from its entry, the legal title having vested in the purchaser.</p>
    <p id="b360-7" data-blocks='[["BL_360.9",360,[277,976,1168,429]]]'>As against Kyle and Dunlap, Heller was entitled to his exemption, and having claimed it down to the time of distribution, he then released it. The learned judge considered -his conduct so unreasonable that he would not give Kyle and Dunlap the benefit of the release, but insisted on treating Heller as still claiming his exemption. Such a claim could not avail against Clever because he was assignee of Clark of one of the purchase-money bonds, and his judgment was on that bond. The consequence of discharging Heller’s release was to give the fund to Clever, though the latest creditor on the record.</p>
    <p id="b360-8" data-blocks='[["BL_360.10",360,[274,1405,1167,856]]]'>A debtor is offered an exemption of $300 by the Act of 1849, if he claims it in due time. But because it is a personal right he may waive it. He is not compelled to accept the bounty of the statute. He is not permitted to assign it, but it is impossible to say that he may not release it, and that at any time before the money is actually in his pocket. Heller’s conduct was capricious and unreasonable, beyond doubt, but the positive release of a personal right, even by a capricious and unreasonable man, cannot be judicially set aside. And where a debtor fails to claim his exemption, or having claimed it afterwards releases it, he stands as if there were no exemption statute. As to him it is a dead letter, and of course the proviso of the 3d section dies with the section. That proviso saves purchase-money securities from the effect of the debtor’s claim of exemption, not from the effect of prior liens of record. If there is no claim of exemption at the time of distribution, the record determines priority of lien, and the proviso in the exemption law is inoperative. Provisoes are designed to save something out of the enacting clause, and when the enacting clause is repealed or displaced, its proviso goes with it.</p>
    <p id="b360-9" data-blocks='[["BL_360.11",360,[276,2262,1164,128]],["BL_361.1",361,[142,383,1170,128]]]'>The mistake of the learned judge consisted in applying the proviso against <em>judgment-creditors, </em>whereas its only legitimate operation is against insolvent judgment-cMfors. If they claim <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>$300, they shall not have it against purchase-money liens ; but if they do not claim, purchase-money liens, like all others, must rank according to their date of record.</p>
    <p id="b361-4" data-blocks='[["BL_361.4",361,[144,514,1172,462]]]'>The effect of non-claim in this case is to give the money a different direction from that it would have had, if Heller had persisted in his claim, but that cannot be helped. Whilst he cannot claim his exemption against one creditor and disclaim it in favour of another, and thus virtually assign the legislative bounty to his favourite creditor, he can renounce it altogether, and it is no answer to such a complete and unconditional renunciation, that its legal effect is to disappoint a subsequent judgment-creditor, and give the money to those who are prior. If the law gives him the right of election, the law must accept the consequences of his exercise of it.</p>
    <p id="b361-5" data-blocks='[["BL_361.5",361,[148,987,1166,86]]]'>These views are not inconsistent with rulings in prior cases, and they lead to a reversal of the judgment below.</p>
    <p id="b361-6" data-blocks='[["BL_361.6",361,[319,1074,998,345]]]'>And now, to wit, May 21st 1863, this cause having been argued and fully considered, it is ordered and decreed that the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Cumberland county be reversed and set aside, and that the fund for distribution be paid to James Kyle and Catherine Dunlap, <em>fro rata, </em>according to their respective judgments against Christian Heller, and that the appellee pay the costs.</p>
