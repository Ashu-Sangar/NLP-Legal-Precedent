Where we see that an amendment was proper to reach the merits, we presume that the court were <em>legally </em>satisfied of a <em>mistake, </em>which rendered a change of the names of the parties proper: 12 Harris 489; <a href="/wright/1/0132-02" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Wright 132" data-case-ids="626193" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0132-02">1 Wright 132</a>; 2 Id. 72.

    <p id="b494-9" data-blocks='[["BL_494.11",494,[265,1728,1165,463]]]'>We entirely agree with the learned judge below, that the foreign attachment process in Wisconsin did not in any sense become an action pending against the defendant, A. P. Wilson, until his appearance. Terms are sometimes definitions, and when we say an attachment is a proceeding <em>in </em>rem, we mean that it is not a proceeding against the person. It only holds towards the satisfaction of the débt of the plaintiff, to the extent of the thing attached, and that may not be of one-fourth the value of the debt. It would not therefore be a bar to a suit in another state: <a href="/watts-serg/7/0447-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 447" data-case-ids="481847" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0447-01">7 W. &amp; S. 447</a>; 2 Id. 210; <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Cow.%20523" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Cow. 523">4 Cow. 523</a>; 2 Am.

Granting that that turned it into an action in <em>personam, </em>it would not be a bar to the action brought long before the 'appearance. In that form ;it .was pleaded. Nor would it have availed, had it been pleaded in <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>abatement, as it was in fact the institution of a formal action by the defendant himself, or, what is the same thing, .it was turned into a personal action by his own voluntary act. We think the court treated this matter entirely in accordance with principle and practice.</p>

It is only under special circumstances that one who is a party to a bill or note, can be a witness, or' for some very special purpose; but as neither the special circumstances nor any special purpose was shown, to raise an exception to the rule, we must presume the witness was properly rejected.</p>
