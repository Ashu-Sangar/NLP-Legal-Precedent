In times of excitement it is quite impossible to avoid this, and hence, in such times, moderate views are very sure to be condemned, and even government itself, in all its departments, is sure to be driven into measures which, in the course of a few years, are condemned and pass away. With a sort of moral polarity, the extremes of social excitement breed each other, and moderation falls, for awhile, powerless between them; and usually it is only by severe social trials that this condition of society is remedied, and then it is discovered what were the purposes and ideas to which undue prominence had been given, to the disturbance of the order and harmony of the state.</p>

If this act is law, it is supreme law, and the states can have no militia out of the class usually called to militia duty; for the whole class is appropriated as a national force under this law; and no state can make any law that is inconsistent with it. The state militia is wiped out if this act is valid, except so far as it may be permitted by the federal government. If Congress may thus, under its power to raise armies, constitute all the state militiamen into “national forces” as part of the regular army, and make them “liable to perform duty in the service of the United States when called out by the president,” I cannot see that it may not require from them all a constant military training under federal officers as a preparation for the greatest efficiency when they shall be so called out, and then all the state militia and civil officers may be put into the ranks, and subjected to the command of such officers as the president may appoint, and every one would then see that the constitutional state militia becomes a mere name.

They knew how Episcopalians, Independents, and Presbyterians, Cavalier and Roundhead, Court and Country, Whig and Tory parties, had each in turn, when in power, tyrannized over their opponents, and sacrificed or endangered public liberty; they had felt how great was this evil in all the partisan struggles that preceded our Revolution, and they desired posterity to profit by their experience. The very restriction upon appropriations for the support of the army exceeding two years, is copied from our English ancestors, and was deemed by them a constitutional limitation of the party in power. None of our constitutions, state or federal, have any purpose or function more important than that of restraining and regulating the party that may chance to be in power, and that is one of the most important purposes of the separation of governmental functions into different departments.</p>

There could be no limitation upon the number or size of the armies to be raised, for all possible contingencies could not be foreseen; but our question has not reference to numbers or size, but to the <em>mode </em>of raising armies. The framers of the constitution, and the states which adopted it, derived their ideas of government principally from the example of Great Britain— certainly not from any of the more imperial and despotic governments of the earth. What they meant to make was a more free constitution than that of Great Britain — taking that as q <a id="p255" href="#p255" data-label="255" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*255</a>model in some things — but enlarging the basis of popular rights in all respects that would be consistent with order and stability. They knew that the British army had generally been recruited by voluntary enlistments, stimulated by wages and bounties, and that the few instances of impressment and forced conscriptions of land forces had met with the disfavour of the English nation, and had led to preventive statutes. In 1704, and again in 1707, conscription bills were attempted in Parliament, but laid aside as unconstitutional. During the American revolution, a statute, 19 Geo. 3, ch. 10, permitted the impressment of “ idle and disorderly persons not following any lawful trade, or having some substance sufficient for their subsistence,” and this was as far as English legislation had gone when our federal constitution was planned. Assuredly the framers of our constitution did not intend to subject the people of the states to a system of conscription which was applied in the mother country only to paupers and vagabonds. On the contrary, I infer that the power conferred on Congress was the power to raise armies by the ordinary English mode of voluntary enlistments.</p>

Hence they took away most of the war power from the executive, where, under monarchical forms, it generally resides, and vested it in the legislative department, in one branch of which the states have equal representation, and in the other branch of which the people of the states are directly represented according to their numbers. To these representatives of the states and the people, this power of originating war was committed, but even in their hands it was restrained by the limitation of biennial appropriations for the support of the armies they might raise. Of course no army could be raised or supported which did not command popular approbation; and it was rightly considered that voluntary enlistments would never be wanting to recruit the ranks of such an army. The war power, existing only for the protection of the people, and left, as far as it was possible to leave it, in their own hands, was incapable of being used without their consent, and therefore could never languish for enlistments.

Yet this might easily happen if the power of conscription be conceded to Congress. There are no limitations expressed — nothing to compel Congress to observe quotas and proportions as among the several states — nothing to prevent their raising armies wholly from one state, taking every able-bodied citizen out of it to the endangering, if not utter undoing of all its domestic interests.</p>

If such - a construction had been anticipated, the objections which the constitution encountered in the state ccmventions would doubtless have been found insurmountable. •But what ought to be sufficient to settle the question is the language of clauses 16 and 17, which, if it have any meaning at all, absolutely forbids the interpretation on which the Conscription Act is founded. And these clauses must be taken in connection with the 13th in fixing the meaning of the words “to raise and support armies, ’ because the constitution, like most other <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>written documents, is its own best interpreter, and must be construed as a whole — by its four corners, as we sometimes say. Therefore, if we concede this dangerous power to the language of the 13th clause, we destroy the force and effect of the words of the 16th and 17th clauses. We make the instrument self-destructive, which is violative of all canons of construction. Congress shall have power to provide for calling forth the militia in the manner and subject to the limitations prescribed in clauses 16 and 17, and therefore I argue Congress has not the power to draft them. Is an express rule of the constitution to give way to an implied one ? If the 13th clause confers power to draft the militia, the words of the 16th and 17th clauses are the idlest that were ever written. But if the 13th conferred only the power to enlist volunteers, then the subsequent clauses become very intelligible — stand well with the 13th, and add essentially to the martial faculties of the federal governmental Look at those clauses. The militia are to be called forth To execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions, to be organized, armed, and disciplined by the state, but according to the laws of Congress, and such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States are to be governed by the president, but officered by the respective states. Now, this Conscription Law recites an “ existing insurrection and rebellion” as the ground and reason, not for calling forth the militia under the above provisions, but for <em>drafting </em>them into the military service of the United States. The very case has occurred in which the constitution says the militia shall be called out under state officers, but Congress says they shall be drafted in contempt of state authority. This cannot be put on that clause of the constitution which authorizes Congress to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, because that is not a grant of any additional power, but only of the legislative faculty to execute “ the foregoing powers.” What those powers are is first to be ascertained, and then, in virtue of this provision, Congress may provide the necessary and proper laws. The question we aré dealing with has not reference to the mere forms of legislation, but to the essential powers of government. If <em>any </em>conscription law may be directed against state militia, for the suppression of rebellion and insurrection, this may be conceded to be a valid enactment, but whether a government of limited and expressly delegated powers may, for such a purpose, forcibly take away the militia of other governments, which are sovereign in their respective spheres, is a question which the instrument of delegation can alone answer. Congress have said in this act that the rights of states may be thus disregarded. General Washington and the men of liis day did not so read the constitution, when, in suppressing the <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>Whiskey Insurrection in this state, they paid the most scrupulous regard to the rights and powers of the state. Under pressure of a foreign war, a conscript bill was reported in Congress in 1814, but it did not pass, and if it had it would have been no precedent for this law, because we are now dealing with an insurrection, and insurrections are specially provided for in the constitution. If to support a foreign war, Congress may draft the militia, which I do not admit, the power of draft to suppress insurrections is not to be implied, since another mode of suppressing insurrections is expressly provided. When a state is called on for its quota of militia it may determine by lot who of the whole number of its enrolled militia shall answer the call, and thus state drafts are quite regular, but a congressional draft <em>to suppress insurrection, </em>is an innovation that has no warrant in the history or text of the constitution. Either such a law or the constitution must be set aside. They cannot stand together.</p>

And yet not here, for Magna Charta <em>created </em>no rights, but only reasserted those which existed long before at common law.

The land or naval forces mean the regular military organization of the government, the standing army and navy, into which citizens are introduced by military education from boyhood, or by enlistments, and become, by their own consent, subject to the military code, and liable to be tried and punished without any of the forms or safeguards of the common law. In like manner the militia, when duly called out and placed “in actual service,” are subject -to the rules and articles of war, all their common law rights of personal freedom being for the time suspended. But when are militiamen in actual service ? When they have been notified of a draft ? Judge Story, in speaking of the authority of Congress over the militia, says: “ The question when the authority of Congress over the militia becomes exclusive, must essentially depend upon the fact when they are to be deemed in the actual service of the United States. There is a clear distinction between calling forth the militia and their being in actual service. These are not contemporaneous acts, nor necessarily identical in their constitutional bearings. The president is not commander-in-chief of the militia, except when in actual service; and not merely when they are ordered into service. <em>They are subjected to martial law only when in actual service, and not merely when called forth before they have obeyed the call. </em>The Acts of 1795, and other acts on the subject, manifestly contemplate and recognise this distinction. <em>To bring the militia within the meaning of being in actual </em>service, <em>there must be obedience to the call, and some acts of organization, mustering, rendezvous, or marching done in obedience to the call in the -public service:’’ </em>Story’s Con.

When Judge Story was endeavouring to mark, with such distinctness, the time at which the common law rights of the citizen ceased, and his liability to military rule began— the time, in a word, when he became a soldier — why did it not occur to his fertile mind that Congress could render this distinction valueless and unmeaning by a new nomenclature — by calling the militia “ national forces ?” It is not difficult to conceive how such a suggestion would have fared had it occurred or been made to him.

The objects to be attained, as declared in the preamble, -must also be kept in view, when we are called to expound its provisions; and we are bound, to construe it so as to preserve and advance them all. The purpose, as declared in the preamble, was “ to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.” Each of these objects are supposed to be secured by the constitution, and no one of them must be overlooked.in a too eager desire to lend a supposed efficiency to some other. To do so, would endanger the whole.

At the time this was the usual mode of raising and recruiting armies in Great Britain, and the people of this country were better acquainted with the laws, customs, and even habits of the people of England than of those of any other people in the world/ Notwithstanding we had been at war with them, and an angry spirit had been generated between the two countries, yet it is a notorious fact that their customs and laws were generally adopted in this country, and to this day continue to a great extent. Voluntary enlistments, as by contract, was the general method of raising armies there and with us, prior to and at the time the constitution was framed. As this was the customary mode, every presumption supports the idea that this was the only mode in the minds of the framers of the constitution. Indeed, it is a common law rule, that when anything is directed to be done, without special instructions as to how the act is to be performed, the customary mpde of doing it is supposed to be included in the direction. 'We cannot suppose that at the moment the country had achieved its liberty, at so much cost of blood and treasure, that such a despotism over the lives and liberties of men, would be incorporated into the constitution as would authorize Congress to fill the armies to be raised, by conscription, as if by the agency <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>of the press-gang./ This was no more in the contemplation of-the convention than that the civil department of the government should also be filled by coercive measures. Can any one now be credulous enough to believe that if a power had been supposed to exist, to raise an army, not by voluntary means but by coercive, especially as there were no limits fixed as to its magnitude, that the constitution would have been ratified by the states ? The idea would, it seems to me, be preposterous. Without such a thought once having been suggested by the opponents of the constitution, a standing army to- be raised in the usual way was a source of many fears in the public mind. It was thought to be dangerous to liberty in its very nature ; but what would have been thought if it had been discovered or avowed that in its creation it might be directly and openly destructive of the individual liberties of those who were to compose it, and that it might be extended to embrace all the able-bodied citizens in the states!

It is true that in 1814, the question was much agitated in Congress whether or not, under the power to “raise armies,” the militia might not be conscripted by the federal authority. The bill which proposed this had the sanction of high names; but it differed much from this act, and was never finally acted on, because of the termination of the war by the peace of Ghent. The discussion on this bill was able, but partisan, and furnishes little aid to a judicial examination, and hence I have not recurred to it much in taking the view herein expressed. That a government like that of Great Britain may resort to conscription to fill the ranks of her armies, and has done so on many occasions, is no argument or precedent for that practice under the federal constitution. Even in England, this is far from the ordinary mode of recruiting the army, and it will hardly be contended that the exception to the rule, will establish a custom by which to define the meaning of the words “to raise and support armies,” used in our federal constitution, so that <em>ex vi </em>termini, conscription or draft, both involuntary modes, were thereby meant.</p>

This is manifested by many provisions of that instrument, as well as by its general purpose,'declared to be for “ common defence.” Indeed such a power is necessary to preserve the existence of any independent government, and none has ever existed without it. It was therefore expressly ordained in the eighth article, that the Congress of the United States should have power to “provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the Union, suppress insurrections, and repel invasions.” It was also ordained that they should have power to provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving.to the states respectively the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress. Nor is this all. It is obvious that if the grant of power to have a military force had stopped here, it would not have answered all the purposes for which the government was formed. It was intended to frame a government that should make a new member in the family of nations. To this end, within a limited sphere, every attribute of sovereignty was given. To it was delegated the absolute and unlimited power of making treaties with other nations, a power explicitly denied to the <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>states. This unrestricted power of making treaties involved the possibility of offensive and defensive alliances. Under such treaties the new government might be required to send armies beyond the limits of its territorial'jurisdiction; and in fact, at the time when the constitution was formed, a treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive, was in existence between the old Confederacy and the government of France. Yet more. Apart from the obligations assumed by treaty, it was well known that there are many cases where the rights of a nation and of its citizens cannot be protected or vindicated within its own boundaries. But the power conferred upon Congress over the militia is insufficient to enable the fulfilment of the demands of such treaties, or to protect the rights of the government, or its citizens, in those cases in which protection must be sought beyond the territorial limits of the country. The power to call the militia mto the service of the federal government is limited by express terms. It.reaches only three cases. The call may be made “to execute the laws of the Union, to suppress insurrections, and to repel invasions,” and for no other uses. The militia cannot be summoned for the invasion of a country without the limits of the United States. They cannot be employed, therefore, to execute treaties of offensive alliance, nor in any case where military power is needed abroad to enforce rights necessarily sought in foreign lands. This must have been understood by the framers of the constitution, and it was for such reasons doubtless that other powers to raise and maintain a military force were conferred upon Congress, in addition to those which were given over the militia. By the same section of the eighth article of the constitution it was ordained, in words of the largest meaning, that Congress should have power to “ raise and support armies,” a power not to be confounded with that given over the militia of the country. Unlike that, it was unrestricted, unless it be considered a restriction that appropriations of money to the use of raising and supporting armies were forbidden for a longer term than two years. In one sense this was a practical restriction. Without appropriations no army can be maintained, and the limited period for which appropriations can be made, enables the people to pass judgment upon the maintenance and even existence of the army every two years, and in every new Congress. But in the clause conferring authority to raise armies, no limitation is imposed other than this indirect one, either upon the magnitude of the force which Congress is empowered to raise, or upon the uses for which it may be employed, or upon the mode in which the army may be raised. If there be any restriction upon the mode of exercising the power, it must be found elsewhere than in the clause of the constitution that conferred it. And if a restricted mode of exercise was intended, it is remark<a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>able that it was not expressed, when limitations were so carefully imposed upon the power given to call for the militia, and more especially when, as it appears from the prohibition of appropriations for the army for a longer time than two years, the subject of limiting the power was directly before the minds of the authors of the constitution. This part of the constitution, like every other, must be held to mean what its framers, and the people who adopted it, intended it should mean. We are not at liberty to read it in any other sense. We cannot insert restrictions upon powers given in unlimited terms, any more than we can strike out restrictions imposed.</p>

It is said and truly said that the federal government is one of limited powers. It has no other than such as are expressly given to it, and such as (in the language of the constitution itself) “are necessary and proper for carrying into execution” the powers expressly given. By the tenth article of the amendments, it is ordained that the powers not delegated to the United States by the constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. Of course there can be no presumption in favour of the existence of a power sought to be exercised by Congress. It must be found in the constitution. But this principle is misapplied when it is used, as is sometimes the case, to restrict the right to exercise a power expressly given. It is of value when the inquiry is whether a power has been conferred, but of no avail to strip a power, given in general terms, of any of its attributes. The powers of the federal government are limited in number, not in their nature. A power vested in Congress is as ample as it would be if possessed by any other legislature — none the less because held by the federal government. It is not enlarged or diminished by the character of its possessor. Congress has power to borrow money. Is it any less than the power of a state to borrow money ? Because the federal government has not all the powers which a state government has, will it be contended that it cannot borrow money, or regulate commerce, or fix a standard of weights and measures, in the same way, by the same means, and to the same extent as any state might have done, had no federal constitution ever been formed? If not, and surely this will not be contended, why is not the federal power to raise armies, as large and as unfettered in the mode in which it may be exercised, as was the power to raise armies possessed by the states before 1787, and possessed by them now in time of war ? If they were not restricted to voluntary enlistments in procuring a military force, upon what principle can Congress <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>be ?

In 1756, but a short time before the Revolutionary War, a British statute had enacted that all persons without employment might be seized and coerced into the military service of the kingdom. The act may be found at length in Ruffhead’s British Statutes at Large, vol. 7, p. 625. Another act of a similar character was passed in 1757: British Statutes at Large, vol. 8, p. 11. Both were enacted under the administration of William Pitt, afterwards Lord Chatham, reputed to have been one of the staunchest defenders of English liberties. They were founded upon a principle always recognised in the Roman empire, and asserted by all modern civilized governments, that every able-bodied man capable of bearing arms, owes personal military service <em>to </em>the government which protects him. Lord Chatham’s acts were harsh and unequal in their operation, much more so than the act of Congress now assailed. They reached only a select portion of the able-bodied men in the community, and they opened wide a door for favouritism and other abuses. For these reasons, they must have been the more prominently before the eyes of the framers of the federal constitution, when they were providing safeguards for liberty and checks to arbitrary power. Yet, in full view of such enactments, they conferred ujoon Congress an unqualified power to raise armies. And, still more than this, coercion into military service by classification and draft from the able-bodied men of the country was to them a well-known mode of raising armies in the different states which confederated to carry on the Revolutionary War. It was equally well known to the people who ordained and established the constitution, expressly “in order to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, and secure the blessings of liberty for themselves and their posterity.” It is an historical fact, that, during the later stages of the war, the armies of the country were raised not alone by voluntary enlistment, but also by coercion, and that the liberties and independ<a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>ence sought to be secured by the constitution, were gained by soldiers made such, not by their own voluntary choice, but by compulsory draft.] Chief Justice Marshall, himself a soldier of the RevolutionTthan whom no one was better acquainted with revolutionary history, in his Life of Washington (vol. 4, p. 241), when describing the mode in which the armies of the government were raised, makes the following statement: “ In general, the Assemblies (of the states) followed the example of Congress, and apportioned on the several counties within the states the quota to be furnished by each. This division of the state was again to be subdivided into classes, and each class was to furnish a man by contributions or taxes imposed on itself. In some instances, a draft was to be used in the last resort.” This mode of recruiting the army by draft, in revolutionary times, is also mentioned in Ramsey’s Life of Washington (vol. 2, p. 246), where it is said: “ When voluntary enlistments fell short of the proposed numbers, the deficiencies were, by the laws of several states, to be made up by drafts or lots from the militia.” Thus it is manifest that when the members of the convention proposed to confer upon Congress the power to raise armies, in unqualified terms, and when the people of the United States adopted the constitution, they had in full view compulsory draft from the population of the country, as a known and authorized mode of raising them. The memory of the Revolution was then recent. It was universally known that it had been found impossible to raise sufficient armies by voluntary enlistment, and that compulsory draft had been resorted to. If, then, in construing the constitution we are to seek for and be guided by the intention of its authors, there is no room for doubt. Had any limitation upon the mode of raising armies been intended, it must have been expressed. It could/not have been left to be gathered from doubtful conjecture. It is incredible that when the power was given in words of thd largest signification, it was meant to restrict its exercise to a' solitary mode, that of voluntary enlistment, when it was known that enlistments had been tried and found ineffective, and that coercion had been found necessary. The members of the convention were citizens of the several states, each a sovereign, and each having power to raise a military force by draft, a power which more than one of them had exercised. By the constitution, the authority to raise such a force was to be taken from the states partially, and delegated to the new government about to be formed. No state was to be allowed to keep troops in time of peace. The whole power of raising and supporting armies, except in time of war, was to be conferred upon Congress. Necessarily, with it was given the means of carrying it into full effect.</p>

But I have not been shown, and I am unable to perceive, that compelling military service in the armies of the United States, not by arbitrary conscription, but, as this act of Congress directs, by enrolment of all the able-bodied citizens of the United States, and persons of foreign birth, who have declared their intention to become citizens, between the ages of twenty and forty-five (with some few exceptions), and by draft by lot from those enrolled, infringes upon any reserved right of the states, or inter feres with any constitutional right of a private citizen.

The argument was urged in strange forgetfulness of what civil liberty is. In every free government the citizen or subject surrenders a portion of his absolute rights in order that the remainder may be protected and preserved. There can be no government at all where the subject retains unrestrained liberty to act as he pleases, and is under no obligation to the state. That is undoubtedly the best government which imposes the fewest restraints, while it secures ample protection to all under it. But no government has ever existed, none can exist, without a right to the personal military service of all its able-bodied men. The right to civil liberty in this country never included a right to exemption from such service. Before the federal constitution was formed, the citizens of the different states owed it to the governments under which they lived, and it was exacted. The militia systems of the states then asserted it, and they have continued to assert it ever since. They assert it nowj No one doubts the power of a state to compel its militia into personal service, and no one has ever contended that such compulsion invades any right of civil liberty. On the contrary, it is conceded that the right to civil liberty.is subject to such power in the state governments, and the history of the period immediately antecedent to the adoption of the federal constitution shows that it was then admitted. Is civil liberty now a different thing from what it was when the constitution was formed ? It is better protected by the provisions of the constitution, but are the obligations of a citizen to the government any less now than they were then ? This cannot be maintained. If, then, coercion into military service was no invasion of the rights of civil liberty en<a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>joyed by the people of the states before the federal constitution bad any existence, it cannot be now.</p>

The force of the objection is not apparent. Confessedly the army must be raised by legal means. By such means it must also be supported. It has already been shown that enrolment and draft are not illegal; that to make them illegal, a prohibition must be found in the letter or in the spirit of the constitution. Arbitrary seizures of private property for the support of the army are illegal and prohibited. Not only does the constitution point out the mode in which provision shall be made for the support of the army, but in numerous provisions it protects the people against deprivation of property without compensation and due course of law. Exemption from such seizures was always an asserted and generally an admitted right, while exemption from liability to being compelled to the performance of military service was, as has been seen, never claimed. There are therefore limitations upon the means which may be used for the support of the army, while none are imposed upon the means of raising it.</p>

Under the Act of 1795, the drafted men were not declared to be subject to military law until mustered into service. This is the act of which Judge Story speaks in his Commentaries.

It is said the draft takes a portion of those who owe militia service to the states, and thus diminishes the power of the states to protect themselves. The states, it is claimed, retain the principal power over the militia, and therefore the power given to Congress to raise armies must be so construed as not to destroy or impair that power of the states. If, say the complainants, Congress may draft into their armies, and compel the service of a portion of the state militia, they may take the whole, and thus the entire power of the states over them may be annulled, for want of <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>any subject upon, which it can act. I have stated the argument quite as strongly as it was presented. It is more plausible than sound. It assumes the very matter which is the question in debate. It ignores the fact that Congress has <em>also </em>power over those who constitute the militia. The militia of the states is also that of the general government. It is the whole able-bodied population capable of bearing arms, whether organized or not. Over it certain powers are given to Congress, and others are reserved to the states. Besides the power of calling it forth, for certain defined uses. Congress may provide for its organization, arming, and discipline, as well as for governing such portion as may be employed in its service. It is the material, and the only material contemplated by the constitution, out of which the armies of the federal government are to be raised. ^Whether gathered by coercion or enlistment, they are equally -taken out of those who form a part of the militia of the states. Taking a given number by draft no more conflicts with the reserved power of the states than does taking the same number of men in pursuance of their own contract. No citizen can deprive a state of her rights without her consent. None could .therefore voluntarily'enlist, if taking a militiaman into military service in the army of the United States is in conflict with any state rights over the militia. Those rights, whatever they may bp, it is obvious cannot be affected-by the mode of taking. /It is clear that the states hold their power over the militia, subordinate to the power of Congress to raise armies out of the population that constitutes it. Were it not so, the delegation of the power to Congress would have been an empty gift. Armies can be raised from no other source./ Enlistments in other lands are generally prohibited by foreign enlistment acts, and even where they are not, they may, under the law of nations, involve a breach of neutrality. Justly, therefore, may it be said the objection now under consideration begs the question in debate^ It assumes a right in the state ■which has no existence, to wit, a right to hold all the population that constitutes its militiamen exempt from being taken in any way into the armies of the United States. /When it is said, if any portion of the militia may be coerced •into such military service the whole may, it is but a repetition of the common but very weak argument against the existence of a power, because it may possibly be abused./’ It might with equal force be urged against the existence of any power in either, the state or general government. It applies as well to a denial of power to raise armies by voluntary enlistment. It is as conceivable that high motives of patriotism, or inducements held out by the federal government, might draw into its military service the entire able-bodied population of a state, as that the whole might be drafted. We are not to deny the existence of a <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>power because it may possibly be unwisely exercised, nor are rve to presume that abuses will take place. Especially are we not at liberty to do so in this case, in view of the fact that the general government is under constitutional obligations to provide for the common defence of the country, and to guarantee to each state a republican form of government. That yiould be to impose a duty, and deny the power to perform it.</p>

All the powers, therefore, vested in the national government, are necessarily supreme and paramount, and cannot be rightfully disobeyed by her citizens. This general government has the sole and exclusive power of declaring war and making peace, of raising and supporting armies, of providing and maintaining a navy, of laying and collecting taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay the debts, and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the United States, and of borrowing money on the credit of the United States. The avowed object of these and other powers, vested in the general government, was to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to the people of the United States and their posterity. It was therefore solemnly declared, and made a fundamental article of. the national constitution, that the constitution and the laws of the United States which shall be made in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land; and the judges in every state shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

The officers, however, were still elective, for which reason the governor objected to the bill. He also required that persons alleging conscientious scruples against bearing arms should appear in open court, and declare to what society they belonged ; that they were truly and religiously opposed to war; and that a court-martial should be authorized to punish by death or otherwise, as was provided by the English militia bill.

The armies of the United States have always been raised by contract, never by conscription, and nothing more can be wanting to a government possessing the power thus claimed, to enable it to usurp the entire control of the militia, in derogation of the authority of the state, and to convert it by impressment into a standing army.” They also denounced as unconstitutional the law authorizing the enlistment of minors and apprentices without the consent of parents and guardians.

The reasons upon which my opinion was founded I then reduced to writing, and they are on file in this court. They are not all which I might have given. Upon the power of a state court to enjoin a federal officer against the performance of a duty imposed upon him by an Act of Congress, I refrained from expressing any opinion. I refrain now. Yet I had no doubt then, and I have none now, that these bills do not present a proper case for the interference of a court of equity, by injunction, even if the Act of Congress were unconstitutional. The facts charged exhibit no case for the action of a court of equity. No chancellor ever enjoined in such a case, and I think it has never before been supposed that he has any jurisdiction over such a wrong (if it be a wrong) as these complainants ask to he restrained. During the whole of the two arguments to which I have listened, one in support of the original motions, and the other against the present motions to dissolve the injunctions, I have heard no reference to an authority for the position that a court of equity has any right to interfere in. such a case. I believe no authority of the kind can be founcLj Reference has indeed, been made to our Act of Assembly of June 16th 1836, which confers upon this court and the several Courts of Common Pleas, power to “prevent or restrain the commission or continuance of acts contrary to law, prejudi<a id="p296" href="#p296" data-label="296" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*296</a>cial to the interests of the community or the rights of individuals but until now it has never been supposed that this aot extends the preventive power of this court beyond that possessed by any English chancellor. No one has ventured to assert that every civil wrong may be restrained by injunction, and that a judge sitting in equity can enjoin against any act that a common law court and jury can redress. It -was jurisdiction and power in equity that the legislature intended to bestow upon our courts; and it has never been seriously claimed that they bestowed more than is possessed and exercised by courts of equity in England and in other states. But when, before these cases, was an injunction ever granted to restrain the commission of a merely personal tort ? What chancellor ever asserted he had such power ? It was hinted in the argument, that the power must be vested in this court, because the privilege of the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>has been suspended in certain cases. The hint will not bear examination. Plow can the suspension of the writ of <em>habeas </em>corpus, either by Congress or any branch of the federal government, enlarge the jurisdiction of this court ? Or how can the restoration of this privilege curtail its jurisdiction ? The extent of the powers of every court in this state is defined by state law. It is not in the power of Congress to enlarge it, either by direct or indirect action. Besides, if the suspension of the privilege of the writ of <em>habeas corpus </em>could confer upon a state court a power to enjoin against an arrest (a power which, without the suspension, it would not possess), then the Constitution of the United States, in authorizing it in cases of rebellion or invasion, when the public safety may require it, has merely converted a <em>habeas corpus </em>into an injunction, and substituted a bill in equity for a common law writ. Then the object sought to be accomplished by the constitutional provision has utterly failed. Manifestly, the constitution contemplates the possible necessity of arrests without the interference of courts in times of rebellion or invasion, and it has provided for such cases by authorizing a denial of the privilege of the writ of <em>habeas corpus. </em>But what does this amount to, if the very act of taking away the writ enlarges the power of state courts of equity, and justifies them in interfering to prohibit the arrests ? I will not however, pursue this subject further; I mention it at all only because I would not have it thought that I admit the power of this court to interfere by injunction, even if the defendants proposed wrongfully to force the complainants into the military service of the United States.</p>

I have heard nothing since which <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>has raised even a doubt of the correctness of the opinion I then gave.

In answer to this, it may be said that whatever may be the extent of the rule thus invoked in opposition to these motions, it is still but a rule of practice existing for the relief of the court, and not for the protection of complainants. An interlocutory injunction is entirely at the discretion of the court. It is not a thing of right. Complainants cannot demand it. It is always granted or dissolved, according to the will of the chancellor, and if at any stage of the cause he sees fit to dissolve it, no right of the complainants is taken away. I admit the general rule to be that when an application to dissolve an injunction is made before answer, it must be supported by affidavits on the part of the defendant in answer to those upon which the injunction was obtained. Decisions to this effect may be found in any number. But the rule is applicable only to cases where the <em>facts </em>averred in the bill and special affidavits of the complainants are disputed. It has no relation to cases where the defect is in the complainant’s equity, not in the evidence of his facts,_ ] More frequently a motion to dissolve an injunction is based upon a denial of the facts charged in the bill, but a defendant may move to dissolve it on the sole ground of want of equity in the bill: Minturn <em>v. </em>Seymour, 4 Johns. Chan. 173; Canal Company <em>v. </em>Railroad Company, 4 Gill &amp; Johnson 7. When the motion is made for such a reason, it need not be supported by affidavits, and a bill requiring such support would be absurd. The facts all appear in the bill of the complainant. They are not controverted. Nothing is in issue but the equity arising out of conceded facts, and affidavits either asserting or denying that would be a novelty indeed. Neither courts of law or courts of equity, in any case, require the law or the equity to be made to appear by affidavits. The decision cited in support of the rule of practice referred to have no relation to such cases as the present, which are motions to dissolve injunctions for want of equity in the bill. They could not have been cited unless the distinction between the facts which raise'an equity and the equity <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>itself had been overlooked. Thus in the case first above cited, Chancellor Kent allowed a motion to be made to dissolve an injunction granted by himself, for the want of equity in the bill, though the defendant had not answered. Nor does it appear that he had submitted any affidavits. And in the Canal Company <em>v. </em>Railroad Company, above cited, it was said by Chancellor Bland, in reference to a motion to dissolve an injunction, that <em>“ </em>if it should appear the facts as stated in the bill, looking to the bill alone, gave rise to no equity, it is very certain that the injunction would be dissolved, whether the defendants had answered or not, or however imperfectly they might have answered.” The contest in these cases relates solely to the question whether the complainants have any equity on their own showing. Clearly they have not, if the Act of Congress is constitutional. Now, it is not denied that, if the defendants, before these motions were made, had put in answers admitting all the facts charged in the bills, as they might have done, it would- be the duty of the court to dissolve the injunctions, if the facts raise no equity in favour of the complainants, and that such a course would be perfectly regular. In what particular would the conscience of the court jjg better informed had such answers been put in, than it is now? At most, then, the objection urged with so much vehemence to entertaining the present motions, the objections that the cases stand now as they did when the injunctions were granted, is but the minutest technicality, and interposed not in furtherance of justice, but to defeat it. In truth, however, it does not rise even to the dignity of a technicality, for the present motions are founded, not upon a denial of anything that could be verified by affidavit, but upon a want of equity in the bills, and to such motions the rule requiring answers controverting the facts alleged by the complainants is totally inapplicable.</p>

I think the converse of the proposition is true without any exception, that no state tribunal can issue a writ of <em>habeas, corpus, </em>and under it discharge a person in the custody of an United States officer acting in strict conformity to an Act of Congress, and holding him by virtue of the authority thus vested in him.

Colonial history furnishes no argument, for impressment was a complaint against the king to be found in the Declaration of Independence, and yet no provision was introduced. The history, under the Articles of Confederation, proves nothing, for the weakness of the confederation was one of the very reasons for forming the constitution. The history, since its adoption, is no better, for since 1789 until now, a conscription has never been necessary. The war of 1812 is no exception.

The election of representatives being biennial, the origination of revenue bills confined to the representatives, appropriations to the army limited to two years (or one Congress), and the spirit of opposition to standing armies, made it unlikely that a sufficient regular force should be ever ready to meet unexpected opposition to law, powerful insurrections, and sudden invasions.

This is a great mistake. Sometimes a chancellor having granted a final injunction without argument or upon a very partial hearing, will' entertain a motion to dissolve, to give the parties an opportunity to be fully heard, but the general rule is (and if ever there was a case where it ought to be observed this is that case), that a motion to dissolve will only be entertained after answer or plea, or upon affidavit impeaching the equity of the bill. In Eden on Injunctions, Yol. 1, p. 144, we read: <em>“ </em>This order (to dissolve) will not be made without an affidavit in answer to the material allegations of the bill, and several of the motions upon this subject stood over to give the defendants time to file satisfactory affidavits.” And again, on p. 145 : “ If the answer contains a sufficient defence to the case stated in the bill, the injunction will be dissolved. So where a plea is allowed, there is ordinarily an end of the injunction, but not always, and the court has said that an injunction is not absolutely dissolved on the allowance of the plea, but only <em>nisi, </em>because there may be some equity shown to continue it.” This text of Eden is supported by reference to the best English authorities. The American authorities are full to the same point. In Read <em>v. </em>Consequa, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 174, Judge Washington said: “The motion which is now made to dissolve the injunction absolutely without the answer of the defendant being filed, is altogether unprecedented. If the injunction be granted till answer and further order, which is the usual form, it is never dissolved until the answer comes in, even although the defendant should live abroad, and the motion is accompanied by an affidavit to support it. In this respect the practice of the Court of Chancery and the Court of Exchequer, in England, is the same.” With reference to the point of practice suggested by Judge Washington, I may remark that in the case before us the injunction was not granted subject to further order. The legal effect of it must be, therefore, that it was granted until the coming in of the answer. Where an answer plainly and distinctly denies the facts and circumstances upon which the equity of the bill is based, the injunction will be dissolved: Mene <em>v. </em>Ferrell, 1 Kelly’s R. 7.

That the constitution, being a written document, must be taken as a whole, and every specific grant, however unqualified the language in which it is expressed, must be so construed as to be consistent with other provisions of the instrument — in a word, that the document must be construed in such a manner as to give effect to every part of it. No lawyer will deny that this is a settled canon of construction. If a will devise Blackacre to A., in language which is unqualified, but in a subsequent clause gives half of Blackacre to B., no lawyer would insist on the positiveness of the first devise as a reason for excluding the second, but would receive the second as qualifying or limiting the first. Applying this familiar rule of construction to the case in hand, we say that if the 13th clause confers the power to draft any citizen for any war, it does not confer the power to draft the militia for suppression of insurrection, because another and an inconsistent mode is subsequently provided in the constitution for calling out the militia to suppress insurrections. I will not dwell on this argument, for it was fully presented in our former opinions; but I regret that so little of the subsequent discussion was directed to this point, which is the vital point of the controversy. Indeed the very case is that of a law for enrolling and drafting the militia to suppress an insurrection. Now, if the constitution does expressly declare that they shall be called forth under state officers to suppress insurrections, and does recognise the right of the states to maintain a militia, how can the same instrument authorize them to be drafted irrespective of state authority?

No organ of the general government has any control over the militia until they have entered the military service of the general government, in pursuance of a call directed to the governor, or other proper military officer of the state. This is the purport of the language of the constitution, and of the judicial construction it has uniformly received. The militia are organized and disciplined by the states, according to rules prescribed by Congress, but this vests no more control in Congress than it would in an author whose work on military science the constitution might have adopted, instead of congressional rules of discipline. And let nobody suppose this act to be the exercise of the power conferred by the 16th clause to call out the militia, for it is not that either in fact or form. To call forth the militia in a body, with their state officers at their head, is very unlike drafting them, man by man, into the federal armies, under such officers as the president may choose to appoint over them.

    <p id="b335-6" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[173,585,1171,992]]]'>General Knox, in 1790, and Mr. Monroe, in 1814, expressed themselves in favour of a scheme of conscription, not indeed such as this law, but involving the same principle, and their good names have been much used in this argument. Against them may be set off the constitutional arguments of Mason and Webster — the refusal of Congress to pass such a law in 1814, when we were at war with one of the mightiest nations of the globe— and the facts that Washington put down the Whiskey Insurrection, Madison carried the country through the war of 1812, and Polk carried it through the Mexican war, without a resort to conscription or anything like it. Do not such names and facts more than answer the argument drawn from the suggestions of Knox and Monroe ? Whilst great names ought not to weigh much in any argument, traditional testimony, or what it is commonly called among lawyers, contemporaneous construction, is entitled to great respect in fixing the meaning of any written document; that is to say, the generally received opinion amongst those most interested in a right interpretation of the document, is very high evidence of its meaning. This kind of testimony is altogether against such legislation as we are discussing. In all our history, since the formation of the constitution, the general opinion of statesmen has been, as I believe, adverse to forced recruits for either the army or the navy.</p>

In one of the majority opinions, the 12th and 13th sections of the Conscript Law were alluded to as unconstitutional, on the ground that no citizen could be made liable to be shot as a deserter before he had entered the army, and Judge Story’s Commentaries on the Constitution were cited to prove that militiamen are subjected to martial law only when in actual service, and not merely when called forth, before they have obeyed the call. To bring him within the meaning of being in actual service, there must be, says Judge Story, “ some acts of organization, mustering, rendezvous, or marching, done in obedience to the call.”</p>

Was it because of the insignificance of the interests at stake — only the liberties of three citizens ? Is it nothing to the people of Pennsylvania that they are liable to be shot, and their memories branded as deserters, if they fail to answer a notice of a draft? When such questions press home upon the hearts of the people, is it unworthy of counsel to look into the constitutional rights of the people ? The deserter <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>deserves to be punished, but he only can be a deserter who has become subject to martial law, and serving a paper notice on a man does not put him into actual service and subject him to martial law. It has been said that Judge Washington’s <em>obiter dictum, </em>in Houston <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Whart.%201" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="5 Whart. 1">5 Wh. 1</a>, explodes this rule as stated by Judge Story. What was decided in Houston <em>v. </em>Moore, was the constitutionality of an Act of Assembly of the state of Pennsylvania for inflicting military punishment upon a militiaman neglecting to march with his detachment to the place of rendezvous, after being duly called out under the 16th cause of the 8th section of Article 1 of the Constitution of the United States. It was not the case of a draft under the 13th clause— it was not an Act of Congress that the learned judge ivas to decide upon. How an afSrmance of the constitutionality of that state legislation can explode the rule of federal law laid down by Judge Story, is hard to understand. If it is meant that an unnecessary and inaccurate <em>obiter dictum </em>of Judge Washington or anybody else can explode a settled rule of constitutional law, that is staking the constitutionality of this part of the Act of Congress on a desperate venture. Some broader and more solid ground should be found to rest the argument upon.</p>

    <p id="b336-7" data-blocks='[["BL_336.5",336,[250,1470,1169,902]]]'>A few words as to the remedy. In the opinions of Judge Lowrie and Judge Thompson our Act of Assembly was referred to as our authority for restraining acts contrary to law and prejudicial to the rights of individuals. And it was shown that the acts complained of here were of that character if the Conscript Law be unconstitutional. If <em>habeas corpus </em>had not been suspended, that would have been the plaintiffs’ true remedy, for in numerous cases, as was shown on the argument, state courts have delivered citizens from the military authority of the federal government on <em>habeas corpus. </em>But we are at present situated as if we had never had <em>habeas corpus. </em>It is impossible, therefore, to deny the equity jurisdiction on the ground that there is remedy at law. There is no remedy at law; and even where there is, the rule in equity is, that it must be an adequate remedy to oust the jurisdiction of equity. We had a great consideration a few years ago of the question whether equity would decree specific performance of a contract for sale of lands, there being remedies at law both by covenant and ejectment, but the equity jurisdiction was sustained on the ground of the inadequacy of the legal remedies. Had there been no legal remedies whatever, which is the case here, the case would scarcely have been made.</p>

Here a distinction exists which never ought to be lost sight of. State courts have no power to interfere with or resist the <em>process or judgments of the federal </em>courts, and the rule is reciprocal — the federal courts have no power to disregard the process or judgments of state courts, as was determined in the notable case of Taylor <em>v. </em>Carryl, about The Royal Saxon, reported in <a href="/us/61/0583-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="20 How. 583" data-case-ids="5680233" data-case-paths="/us/61/0583-01">20 How. 583</a>.</p>

In the forms of the constitution that court may review certain proceedings of state courts; but in all other respects, even where concurrent jurisdiction exists over the subject-matter, the federal and state courts mutually respect that jurisdiction which first attaches. The ease of Ableman <em>v. </em>Booth, so much relied on, belongs to this class of questions upon judicial process, and all that fell from the chief justice in that case is to be restrained to the facts of the case. This is a rule always necessary to be imposed upon judicial language.

They were mere ministerial agents of the executive department, engaged in executing what we held to be an unconstitutional Act of Congress, and, therefore, are not within the rule above stated, nor within the authorities cited to sustain that rule. Such ministerial agents have often been restrained by state courts and state judges generally, indeed, upon <em>habeas corpus, </em>where personal liberty has been at stake, but the right of state judges to inquire into the validity of ministerial proceedings under Acts of Congress, is as perfectly vindicated by <em>habeas corpus </em>cases as any other.

Our jurisdiction as a court of equity under our Act of 1836 bas not been suspended, and any citizen bas a right to appeal to it in defence of personal liberty. Courts of equity are accustomed to enjoin to prevent frauds, waste, nuisances, trespasses, obstructions, and diversion of watercourses, and in numerous other torts. The principle of injunctive relief against a tort is, that the inadequacy of the remedy at law is a sufficient equity, and will warrant an injunction against the commission or continuance of the wrong: Adams’ Equity 478. The inadequacy of all remedies of law for infringement of personal liberty, when <em>habeas corpus </em>is suspended, is too. plain to be doubted or discussed, and the necessary consequence is, that courts of chancery would have jurisdiction, and the Act of Assembly clothes us with their powers. If courts of chancery have not jurisdiction of torts which touch liberty, what are we to say, that property is better guarded with us than liberty ? Who is willing to stand on that ground ? For one, I am not. I would not say that a man has more rights in his horse or his house than he has in himself. If equity will restrain torts in respect to lands and goods, much more will it restrain torts in respect to the immensely higher interest — human liberty — when alLLsgal remedies have been taken away.</p>
