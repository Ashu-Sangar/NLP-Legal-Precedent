Mattocks commenced the settlement in the fall of 1798 or 1799. Previous to obtaining the patent, which was in October 1817, and upon a -warrant to Jacob Flake, surveyed July 9th 1817 (the title whereto was vested in Joseph Clark); Mattocks, by deed of grant, bargain, and sale, dated September 10th 1817, formally conveyed the eastern half to the said Joseph Clark, who had become vested with all the interest of Field.

The result of the case depended upon the validity or effect of this tax title. The plaintiffs claimed that the law did not authorize the sale; that the legal presumption of payment of the taxes after so great a lapse of time, the effect of the deed from Mattocks to divest his lien for taxes, and the Statute of Limitations; all operated to bar the recovery of the taxes in this way.

It was conceded that John Field died on or prior to 6th of May 1824. Joseph Field, the administrator, was a son, and one of five lineal heirs and survivors of John Field, and had, on the 10th of March 1832, by deed of that date, conveyed all his interest in his father’s real estate, except what was situate in the city and county of Philadelphia, to George Uhler, which deed was duly recorded. This title and interest was subsequently conveyed by Uhler to one of the plaintiffs, and so continued at the institution of this suit. The first <em>testatum </em>writ was issued to Crawford county, and a levy made upon the land in controversy in May 1831. In 1835 this levy was stricken off, and an <em>alias </em>writ issued in September of that year, and a levy again made upon this land, inquisition had and condemnation obtained.

      <em>“ </em>The first points presented by the counsel on both sides of this controversy, raise the question whether the sheriff’s sale of this land, on the 19th of July 1836, to Robert Kain, the ancestor of the defendants, on a <em>test, </em>writ from Philadelphia county, vested any title in the purchaser. The judgment was against Joseph Field, administrator of John Field, deceased, without notice to his widow and heirs, except so far as the defendant himself, being one of the heirs, would be affected thereby. John Field died,_ as is conceded, on the 6th of May 1824. This judgment was recovered by amicable suit in favour of Joseph Clark in trust for his creditors on the 11th of August 1830. A <em>test. fi. fa. </em>had issued on this judgment to the sheriff of Crawford county in 1831, which was levied on this land, but in 1835 this levy, for some reason, not appearing, was on motion stricken off; and in September 1835, an <em>al. test. fi. fa. </em>issued, on which this land with other tracts were levied, and condemnation had. A <em>test. vend. exp. </em>issued on the 10th of June 1836, on which the sale took place on the 19th July ensuing. All these writs were duly entered on the <em>test. ex. </em>docket of Crawford county. Under these circumstances, the defendants claim that the sheriff’s deed is good to pass to his vendee the interest of Joseph Field, which would be one undivided fifth part, he being one of the five heirs at law of John Field, without further notice as an heir than what he derived from being defendant in the judgment as administrator. It is argued that, as administrator, he confessed the judgment before the passage of the Act of 1834, which required notice to the heirs and devisees in order to bind their interest, and was legally cognisant of all the subsequent proceedings on the same for the sale of the real estate, that this was substantially equivalent to the notice required by that act to bind his interest in the estate, and that the proceedings under which the land was sold having been instituted before the passage of the Act of 1834, they are exempted from the operation of that act by the repealing clause, section 71, which repeals ‘ all such Acts of Assembly as are hereby altered or supplied, except so far as may be necessary to finish proceedings commenced, or to settle the estate of persons who may have died before that time.’</p>

    <p id="b119-5" data-blocks='[["BL_119.5",119,[138,807,1165,430]]]'>To rebut this title, the defendants gave in evidence, and relied on a treasurer’s sale of the land, for an adjusted portion of taxes paid by Richard Mattocks, the settler, for the use and benefit of the warrant-holder, accruing from 1801 to 1807, both years inclusive. The adjustment of the commissioners took place on the 21st of February 1838, and the land was sold by the treasurer of Crawford county on the 11th of June following, at the time fixed by law for the sale of lands for taxes, under the Act of 1815, and a deed was executed and delivered in August following. Under this title the defendants claim to hold the land.</p>
    <p id="b119-6" data-blocks='[["BL_119.6",119,[141,1237,1163,299]]]'>The Act of 20th March 1812, under which this sale took place, was one of a class passed about that time, supposed to be necessary to secure the rights of settlers against the warrant-holders. It was applicable to no other portion of the state. If sales have taken place elsewhere than in Crawford county, under the provisions of this statute, I have not been personally cognisant of them, but there may have been many, notwithstanding.</p>
    <p id="b119-7" data-blocks='[["BL_119.7",119,[141,1537,1167,720]]]'>The design of the statute evidently was to furnish the settler with a remedy against the warrant-holder, to compel him to refund his proportion of the taxes assessed and paid by the former on the land in which they were jointly interested. The provision is applicable only to past taxes, for in the 2d section of the act it is made the duty of the assessors to assess the shares of the settler and warrant-holder separately — the one on the seated list, of course, and the other on the unseated. By that operation the taxes on the warrant-holder’s part would be collected out of the land itself, if not paid, and hence the settler would not be <em>compelled </em>to pay it, and it was only in cases where he had been compelled, or perhaps obliged by law to pay, that he was authorized to resort to the Act of 1812 to reimburse himself. After the passage of this act, therefore, I can conceive of no case where the settler could be compelled to pay the taxes of the warrant-holder, and the act would in effect be inoperative in regard to settlements made thereafter. But this is not material.</p>
    <p id="b119-8" data-blocks='[["BL_119.8",119,[146,2265,1161,129]],["BL_120.1",120,[289,389,1166,1670]]]'>The object of the act was plainly to furnish a private remedy to enforce a private right. The public had no interest in it. The taxes had been paid to her. Collection, by the process men<a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>tioned in tbe act, put not a copper into her coffers; it only reimbursed a party for a compulsory outlay for another. It was for the satisfaction and extinguishment of a debt between the parties mentioned. We cannot consider such a claim in any other light than that of a debt. The peculiar remedy given in the absence of any provision for that purpose is not by implication to be held to take away the incidents of a debt. The 'Statute of Limitations and the doctrine of satisfaction from lapse of time remain, as in case of any other debts. My own opinion is, that six years •would bar this remedy. But we need not stand on this. Twenty years, which satisfies judgments, bonds, and mortgages, without something is done to show vitality in them, would surely satisfy a claim like this, which has enjoyed unbroken repose for over thirty years before any act was done in it. Claims for thousands of dollars would be extinguished by such a lapse of time, and why not a claim for $12.70? The statute does not seem to contemplate interest to be included in the adjustment, as was done here. If the claim was to be recovered as taxes, by subrogation to the remedy of the public, then no interest could be included, for the public collect no interest with the arrearages of taxes, excepting when specially authorized. But the presumption extinguishes both principal and interest. This claim for taxes was clearly satisfied after twenty years, nothing having been done in the mean time to keep it alive. The remedy finally resorted to, existed for over a quarter of a century without any resort to it, and we see nothing whatever to break in upon the presumption of satisfaction. On the subject of actual payment, the receipt of Richard Mattocks was excluded; we think it might have been properly received, but in the view we have taken, its rejection was immaterial. To save the sale we cannot presume that the delay in enforcing the repayment of the taxes was the result of disputes “relative to said land,” existing during the period of twenty-five years and upwards. Had this been so, it was a fact which might and ought to have been shown by the defendant. Under these circumstances, therefore, there being no taxes to be recovered, the sale predicated of them was clearly void, and passed no title to the purchaser. The Statute of Limitations, under the Act of 1804, had no operation in the case at all. It could not impart validity to that which was void.</p>

In regard to Joseph Field’s interest as heir, it having been conveyed, in March 1832, to Uhler, whose title the plaintiffs have, it was, upon the principle of that case, clear of the lien of the judgment, before the <em>alias fi. fa. </em>became a lien in Crawford county, and did not pass by the sale under the <em>testatum fi. fa., </em>on the 19th of June 1836.</p>
