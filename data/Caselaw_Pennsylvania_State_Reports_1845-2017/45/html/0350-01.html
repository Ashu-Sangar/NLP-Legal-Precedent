    <p class="summary" id="b350-11" data-blocks='[["BL_350.11",350,[281,1639,1160,558]]]'>The plaintiff’s claim was founded on a rule, dated April 4th 1859, for the payment of $50, six months after date, to D. H. Long or order, and signed A. J. Sener and Jane Miller, her mark, in the presence of Jacob Eertenbaugh. It was averred that Sener, who was the step-son of Miller, had borrowed $50 of Long, under circumstances which seemed to warrant a proceeding against him for obtaining money under false pretences. That to avoid an arrest, this note was given by Sener. Long demanded security. The 'subscribing witness, called for the plaintiff, testified that “ Mr. Miller was present, and told his wife that she should put her name to it, and he would • see it paid; that he would not put his name to paper any more, but that he would see it paid.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b350-12" data-blocks='[["BL_350.12",350,[286,2197,1157,217]],["BL_351.1",351,[150,383,1166,475]]]'>Another witness testified that he was present after this, when Long asked Miller for money, which Miller promised to pay as soon as he could. The magistrate testified that at the hearing before him, Miller acknowledged that he had told his wife to sign the note j that he had sworn never to sign paper for Sener, <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>but that be would have paid the note, if Long had not sued him; that he had told Long that his wife should sign the note, and he would pay it. To a declaration setting forth the above facts, the defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>and subsequently added the plea of payment with leave, under these pleas, he proved the issuing of a warrant against Sener, on the information of Long; the arrest of Sener; the execution of the note by Sener and Mrs. Miller; and offered to prove that the note was given for the debt of another, and had been executed under the circumstances above stated; which was objected to as irrelevant, but the objection was overruled and the testimony admitted.</p>

      <em>Plaintiff’s points. </em>— 1. If John Miller, the defendant, directed and ordered his wife to sign the note, saying that he had sworn not to sign any more notes for Sener, but that she should sgm it and he would see it paid, the plaintiff is entitled to recover, unless there is some other substantial defence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b351-8" data-blocks='[["BL_351.6",351,[146,1158,1166,259]]]'>2. If Sener had obtained money from Long under false pre-tences, and Long made oath before a justice, and had a warrant issued against Sener, and Sener and Miller gave the note in question, for a debt which was honestly due Long, and there is no agreement on the part of Long proved in this case, not to prosecute Sener, the plaintiff may still recover.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b351-9" data-blocks='[["BL_351.7",351,[144,1417,1166,343]]]'>3. Although Long may have prosecuted the defendant for obtaining money under false pretences, there is nothing in the law to prevent the creditor, Long, from obtaining and taking a note from the defendant for his debt, and a recovery may be had on said note, there being no proof in the case that Long compromised the prosecution and bound himself in any way not to prosecute, although Long and the constable went away without taking Sener along with them.</p>

      <em>Defendant’s points. </em>— 1. This being for the debt of another, Sener being treated throughout as a principal, there has in this case been no signing by the defendant or any one for him,' as is required under the Statute of Frauds; and therefore the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b351-11" data-blocks='[["BL_351.9",351,[142,1975,1164,75]]]'>2. There is no consideration shown that can make defendant liable in this ease.</p>

That is the material obligation of the declaration. Most plainly he is not. His wife signed it in her own name at his request, he promising to see it paid, though expressly refusing to sign it. He is therefore not a maker of it, and the writing must be contradicted in order to make him so. If she had expressly signed for him, the question would have been different; but she proposes to sign only for herself.
