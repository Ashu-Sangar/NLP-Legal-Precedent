    <p class="summary" id="b399-6" data-blocks='[["BL_399.4",399,[150,533,1168,1161]]]'>The case was this: — Frederick Gram, late of York county, made his will dated on the 9th September 1827, which was proved on the 12th day of October 1827. At the time of his death he left a widow named Elizabeth, and a granddaughter named Elizabeth Eberly; and also brothers and sisters, and the children of brothers and sisters deceased. After the death of testator, William 0. Houser, the appellee, married the granddaughter Elizabeth Eberly, but they never had any children, and she (Elizabeth Houser) died about six years since, intestate, and some two years, before' the death of the widow of Frederick Gram. Elizabeth, the widow of Frederick Gram, died about two years since, having remained a widower. The real estate of Frederick Gram was sold, and the money paid into the Orphans’ Court of York county for distribution. The auditor reported that Frederick Gram, the testator, left no other heir at his death but this granddaughter. Elizabeth Eberly, named in his will, who was a minor at his death, but who was afterwards married to William C. Houser, and subsequently attained the age of twenty-one years, and died on the 12th day of December, a. d. 1854, aged about thirty years, without issue, and without having made a will, leaving her husband to survive her, and who is still living; that the widow of the testator died in January, a. d. 1861, and after her death the owner of the land, upon which the money was charged, paid the same into court, and that the testator, at the time of his death, left several brothers and sisters and their issue, viz., the appellants, and one brother who had been absent for forty years.</p>

It is my will that after my wife shall have so made her selection, my executors shall proceed with all convenient despatch to sell all the residue of my personal property, as also my real estate, and pay and satisfy all my just debts. It is my will, and I order and direct, that the clear balance of my estate shall remain a lien on the mill and plantation whei-e I now live, during the life or widowhood of my said wife.

I give and bequeath to my granddaughter Elizabeth Eberly, all the estate which may remain in the hands of my executors at the time of the decease of my widow, to be paid to her as soon as may be after that event.

It is my will, and I order and direct, that if my said granddaughter shall die under age and without issue, or after arriving at lawful age, shall die intestate and without issue, the estate hereby given and bequeathed to her shall descend to and be distributed among my heirs, agreeably to the Intestate Laws of the state of Pennsylvania.

D. 1841, was married to Elizabeth Eberly, the granddaughter of the testator, and who now survives her as her husband, claimed the fund on the ground that the money was given to her absolutely by the will, and that the clause in said will, under which the sister and the issue of the deceased brothers and sisters claimed the money, did not give them any right to it, because that clause would create an entailment of the money, or else would only provide for its going over in case Elizabeth did not dispose of it by will, and that, if even the provision for the money going over were good, yet the person designated to take under the character of the testator’s heir, according to the Intestate Law, was no other than Elizabeth herself.</p>

Houser, to which award exceptions were filed' for the other legatees of <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>Frederick Gram; but tbe Orphans’ Court (Fisher, P. J.) held that on the death of the testator, his granddaughter, Elizabeth Eberly, acquired a vested right to receive the amount which might remain unexpended in the hands of his executor at the demise of his wife, which became so fixed and determined that she could have devised or assigned it, and that having done neither in her lifetime, it went to her administrator. With regard to the clause in the will which directs the legacy to be paid to the legatee as soon as may be after the death of his wife, the learned judge held that it must be interpreted as vesting it immediately; adding: <em>“ </em>As regards the clause in the will which directs that if the said Elizabeth ‘ shall die under age and without lawful issue, or after arriving at lawful age shall die without issue and intestate, the estate hereby given and bequeathed to her shall descend to and be distributed agreeably to the Intestate Laws of Pennsylvania,’ it is to be observed that the testator speaks of the gift to Elizabeth as an ‘ estate given and bequeathed,’ thereby evidencing that he intended that it should be vested; but independent of this, we think that there are no words used which reduce her estate below a vested one. This clause could have been operative only in the event of Elizabeth’s death taking place before that of the testator.” The exceptions 'were therefore dismissed, and the report confirmed.</p>

He that <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>claims a decedent’s estate contrary to the general laws of descent, must show a special testamentary law, that can, with reasonable confidence, be interpreted as changing the general law. Is such a special law shown here ? We think not.</p>
    <p id="b402-6" data-blocks='[["BL_402.4",402,[290,565,1172,421]]]'>In its most general form, this legacy is to the widow for life, with remainder to the testator’s sole heir at law and next of kin, his granddaughter. Thus far, after the interest granted to the widow, no change is made in the general law of descent. If the testator had stopped with this provision for his widow, and had said nothing about the remainder, it would have gone to his granddaughter, unless the power given to the widow to use the principal, if she needed it, and thus leave no remainder, should be understood as giving the whole to the widow, a result which no one insists on.</p>
    <p id="b402-7" data-blocks='[["BL_402.5",402,[288,995,1172,429]]]'>But he gives the remainder to his granddaughter, and after-wards inserts a qualification that if she should die under age and without issue, or intestate and without issue, the remainder is to go to his heirs agreeably to the intestate laws. Die when ? In <em>his </em>lifetime or in that of the widow, or any future time ? He does not say. If the first, it was of course vested on his death. If the last, it was an entailment of personal estate, and therefore vested absolutely on his death. If the second, it was contingent on her surviving the widow, and failed by her not doing so.</p>
    <p id="b402-8" data-blocks='[["BL_402.6",402,[288,1423,1170,262]]]'>We have nothing satisfactory to direct us which of these times he meant, and we must not set aside the general law by guessing at a substitute for it. Two possible interpretations accord with the law of descents, and so do the two facts that the granddaughter has power to bequeath the money, and that she and the grandmother might have'used it all in their lifetime.</p>
    <p id="b402-9" data-blocks='[["BL_402.7",402,[288,1682,1168,260]]]'>It seems to us, therefore, that the testator did not intend, by the qualifying clause, to make the interest of his granddaughter contingent; but only to provide heirs for her in case she did not herself dispose of her property. Such provisions are vain, it is true, but nevertheless they are not uncommon, and this idea may solve many anomalous provisions in wills.</p>
