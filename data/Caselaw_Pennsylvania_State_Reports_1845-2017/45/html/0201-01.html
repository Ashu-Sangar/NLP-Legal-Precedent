He had made ample provision for his widow. He had remembered his other legatees who were strangers to his blood, with much liberality, and then occurs to his mind the possibility of a residue. This, <em>if any, </em>he determines he will give to his heirs, those who are of his own blood, who in law, as in the universal experience of the world, are recognised as having superior claims to all others to the property of deceased persons. This small distinction he will make in their favour. But these heirs have specific legacies of different amounts, and therefore he says they shall have the residue, not in equal shares, but in the proportions of their respective legacies. There are a number of them, six in all, and, therefore, to avoid the inconvenience of repeating all their names, he described them as the “ whole of heirs.” Every branch of the clause is fully satisfied by the theory that he meant “heirs” in the strict legal sense; nay, more, can <em>only </em>be satisfied by that theory. For if the testator had designed to give his entire estate to the whole body of his legatees (as would be the case if the appellant’s theory is correct), why did he not sáy so at once, by a direct bequest, stating the proportions in which he wished them to have it ? Certainly if he had entertained such a design he would not have resorted to the awkward and very doubtful mode of doing so that is found <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>in the will. The testator knew perfectly well the meaning of the word “ heirs.” His very first sentence is couched in well-selected legal language. Next is the devise of his residence and lot to his wife, to hold to her, her heirs and assigns for ever, the very phraseology to create a fee simple, strict technical language. Then follows the bequest of the dividend of his interest in the wire factory to his wife during her natural life; then certain household furniture and plate without valuation; then the use of his out-lots during her natural life; then the land in Williams township, “subject to the conditions and understanding between James M. Porter, Esquire, and myself.” To which he adds, “ all of which in lieu of dower or her one-half of my estate,” showing that he understood perfectly not merely what the interest of his wife in his estate would be, at law, but the propriety and the mode of expressing clearly his intention, that she should take what he had given her in lieu of what the law would give her. Then come the pecuniary bequests framed in terse but strictly accurate legal terms. When he gives real estate at the commencement of his will he says: “I give and devise.” When he gives personal estate and money legacies, he says: “ I give and bequeath.” After the bequest of the residue and remainder to his heirs, he says: “ I do hereby vest in my executors full power to sell and convey by deed or deeds any part of my real estate.” And lastly he nominates and appoints his executors, and adds the concluding clause with the date and the attestation in the strictest legal language. On the outside of his will he adds a memorandum, in his own hand also, that certain erasures appearing on the will were made by himself, for reasons satisfactory to himself, “ revoking the legacies given by the words erased.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.2",205,[189,1650,1168,556]]]'>If Colonel McKeen had meant legatees instead of heirs, the words <em>“ </em>already named in this my will” would have been entirely superfluous. But he had other relatives who were “heirs,” but not legatees, not named in the will; therefore he is careful to exclude them by the use of the words in question. This is the strongest evidence that he knew that if he stopped at the word “heirs” it would include other persons who were not named in the will, who were not legatees or <em>hceres faoti, </em>as the learned counsel calls them. To avoid all question upon this subject, therefore, he takes especial pains that only those heirs who have been named in the will shall have the residue. This precaution would not only be entirely useless, but would not have occurred to him if he had meant legatees when he said heirs.</p>

But how are we to do this with the widow ? What is the “ amount” of her legacy ? The learned counsel say one-half, and endeavour to show it by arguing, or rather by asserting, that the testator, by the words “ all of which in lieu of dower or her one-half of my estate,” signified that he had given her one-half of his estate. In other words, this argument amounts to this, that because a testator makes a provision for his widow, which he declares shall be in lieu of her interest in his estate at law, he is to be presumed as having actually given her the precise amount of that interest. By giving her bequests in lieu of her half he gives the half itself. When he says you shall take what I give you, and shall therefore take nothing at law, he really means you shall take at law. This is the direct necessary consequence of the opposing argument.</p>

    <p id="b207-7" data-blocks='[["BL_207.9",207,[148,643,1166,333]]]'>The only question, therefore, which we have upon this record is, whether Colonel McKeen’s will contains satisfactory evidence that he used the word heirs, in the residuary clause, in its popular sense? Popularly, we say of any legatee or devisee that the testator had made him an heir, that he had an heirship, &amp;c. Strictly speaking, an heir is one on whom the law would cast the estate, if there were no will. In which sense is the residuary clause to be taken ?</p>
    <p id="b207-8" data-blocks='[["BL_207.10",207,[149,987,1165,515]]]'>The testator was childless. After giving numerous legacies, six of which were to nephews and nieces who would have been heirs at law had he died intestate, and the rest to more remote kindred, or to strangers to his blood, he gave the residue of his estate “ to be equally divided amongst the whole of heirs already named in this my will, proportioned agreeably to the several amounts given to each in the body of this my will.” Now, all who would have been heirs at law were not named in the will— three or four nephews were omitted. Of course they cannot take. But the six heirs who are named as legatees are, without question, entitled under the residuary clause. Do the other legatees share with them ?</p>
    <p id="b207-9" data-blocks='[["BL_207.11",207,[149,1503,1165,599]]]'>We have had considerable difficulty -with this question on account of the comprehensiveness of the words, “ <em>the whole of heirs already named." </em>But we cannot persuade ourselves that Colonel McKeen meant to make his coachman, to whom he gave a $300 legacy, his heir also, and to admit him to the distribution of the residue along with the right heirs. Yet this absurd consequence would follow from construing the words to embrace all the previously-named legatees. We think the better opinion is that the expression refers to the six nephews and nieces who would have been legal heirs, and who are named; in other words, that the word heirs is to have its technical and proper instead of its popular signification. There is nothing in the context of the will to forbid this construction, and therefore we feel bound by authority to adopt it.</p>
