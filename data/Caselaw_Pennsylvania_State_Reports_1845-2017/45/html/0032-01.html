The delivery of bricks and their use in repairing the furnace, as well as the prices charged for them, were not disputed. The defendants also took the ground that the plaintiffs must recover against all of the individual defendants or none; that, even if some \vere shown to be stockholders, to the satisfaction of the jury, there could be no recovery against these, if others were joined Avko were not stockholders. The plaintiffs, to prove the incorporation of the company, and the stockholdership of the individual defendants, gave in evidence a copy, certified by the secretary of the Commonwealth, of the “ certificate” filed by the directors of the Mauch Chunk Iron Company, in which all the defendants Avere named as stockholders, and four of them, O. H. Wheeler, Lewis Weiss, John Balliet, and Samuel McLean, were among the directors by Avhom it was executed and sworn to. Then they gave the letters patent (produced by defendants’ counsel, on notice) issued by Governor Pollock, pursuant to this certificate and reciting it. They then gave the deposition of John McCauley, manager of the Iron Company, who stated that the company did business <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>during tbe summer and fall ox 1856, repaired the furnace, manufactured iron, &amp;c. This witness also made the following statement: “ The individuals named in the caption as defendants, witness believes all of them were stockholders in said Mauch Chunk Iron Company.” This sentence the court rejected, which is the first error assigned. The defendants had not appeared to cross-examine when McCauly’s deposition was taken. One wit-also said: “0. IT. Wheeler, John Balliet, John Richards, F. C. Kline, Samuel McLean, Lewis Weiss, Isaac Butz, and Charles Lippincott, I met in the meetings of the board of directors.” The plaintiffs then gave in evidence, in the Minute Book of the company, an “ Inventory and appraisement of the property of Weiss, Lippincott &amp; Miner,” (former owners of the furnace), dated 9th April 1856, signed by William Butler and John Balliet, (two of the defendants) and W. L. Richards, styling themselves a “ Committee” appointed for that purpose. Elias Miner was next called as a witness, who stated that he had been a member of the firm of Weiss, Lippincott &amp; Miner, engaged in the foundry and machine business at Mauch Chunk; that the Mauch Chunk Iron Company succeeded them in the spring of 1856; that an inventory in writing was taken, by John Balliet, William Butler, and William L. Richards; that the next day John McCauly came there and took charge of matters, appointing the witness foreman in the foundry department; that he repaired the furnace and carried on the business ; that some of the defendants, John Balliet, 0. IT. Wheeler, Samuel McLean, and Lewis Weiss came there, as directors, as witness understood. The plaintiffs then offered in evidence the records of three judgments against Weiss, Lippincott &amp; Miner, in which Asa Packer andF. C. Kline, one of defendants, John Balliet and Charles Lippincott, also defendants, were, respectively, plaintiffs, each of them receipted as follows : <em>“ </em>Received satisfaction in full for above judgment by transfer of stock of Mauch Chunk Iron Company, July 19th 1856. 0. H. Wheeler, plaintiff’s attorney,” — but the court refused to admit them, which was the third error assigned. W. L. Richards was then called as a witness, who said that he had been secretary of the Mauch Chunk Iron Company; and that he remembered Mr. Wheeler being present at one meeting of the directors. The minutes of a meeting of the board of directors, held 26th May 1856, wore then given, showing the presence and active participation of Samuel McLean, 0. H. Wheeler, and Lewis Weiss, and the passage of a resolution that the debts of Weiss, Lippincott &amp; Miner be fully paid in stock of the company, &amp;e. E. A. Reeder testified to the transaction of some business with the company in December 1856, and to the active participation in the negotiations by 0. H. Wheeler, Samuel McLean, and Lewis Weiss. Robert Lockhart testified that he was present <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>at a meeting of directors when it was resolved to raise $10,000 by an assessment of 30 per cent, on the capital stock.</p>

William Reed testified that the names of stockholders on the first page of the original certificate were all in the handwriting of O. H. Wheeler, as also those on the second page, down to' and including No. 31; that of the signatures of the directors he knew those of O. H. Wheeler, Lewis Weiss, and Samuel McLean to be genuine. The recorder and his deputy were then called and were allowed (under plaintiffs’ exception) to testify that they did not record the certificate correctly, but made the record to differ from the original, at the request of O. H. Wheeler; that for the name of “A. Gr. Brod-head” in the original list of stockholders the name of Samuel McLean was substituted in the entry in the book, and that some changes were also made in the names of the directors. Robert Lockart was then placed upon the stand and testified (under exception by plaintiffs) that he was one of the persons who signed the original certificate, as a director, but that he had no knowledge of any of the alleged stockholders having, at any time, subscribed for stock, nor of their having paid any money to W. L. Richards, receiver, or any one else, on account of such subscription. On his cross-examination, he stated that when he certified that $25,000 had been .paid to Mr. Richards, as receiver, he meant that $25,000 worth of Weiss, Lippincott &amp; Miner’s judgments had been cancelled, and that the company obtained possession of the stock of Weiss, Lippincott &amp; Miner. He also stated that after McCauly left, he, the witness, carried on business there, worked up some of the stock that was there and appropriated the proceeds to the payment of debts of the Mauch Chunk Iron Company. The plaintiffs proposed to ask this witness, on cross-examination, whether Frederick C. Kline, one of the defendants, had not told him that he, Kline, had paid an assessment of 30 per cent, on his stock, but the court refused to allow the question to be put. William L. Richards (also under plaintiffs’ exception) testified that no money was ever paid to him, as receiver, on account of subscriptions to the stock of the company, and that he never s,aw any subscription list to that stock. On cross-examination he said he did see a list with the names of the defendants on it, and a certain number of shares of stock marked opposite to each name; also, that the company obtained possession of the stock of Weiss, Lippincott &amp; Miner, appraised at $88,000, but whether they paid for it and how he could not tell. The defendants gave some further testimony as <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>to the alterations made in the original certificate, and called some witnesses acquainted with John Balliet’s handwriting, who testified that they did not think the name “John Balliet” in the original certificate was his genuine signature. Then, under exception by plaintiffs, they gave in evidence a number of mortgages, judgments, and executions against Weiss, Lippincott &amp; Miner, which were liens on the real and personal property of that firm, and under which the property was afterwards sold.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b37-6" data-blocks='[["BL_37.4",37,[117,748,1157,517]]]'>The plaintiffs, in rebuttal, recalled Elias Miner, who testified that the company took possession of the property of Weiss, Lippincott &amp; Miner; that after the inventory was taken, John Balliet took charge of it until McOauly came, and that Balliet came there frequently — several times a week. That the company was organized and the stock transferred to them in consequence of an agreement between the firm and their creditors, most of whom were represented by O. H. Wheeler, as their attorney. That John Balliet, at one time, told the witness he (Balliet) was assessed 33 per cent, upon his stock, and that F. C.

For the purpose of ascertaining that fact the instrument in writing upon which the charter was granted has been given in evidence. It is clearly shown that the names of the stockholders and the number of shares of stock charged to each is not in the handwriting of the persons made corporators. This was not necessary. The persons representing themselves as directors of the company signed and acknowledged the certificate, and that was sufficient. The certificate and acknowledgment is conclusive evidence against the directors who signed it. They certify over their own proper signature to what is contained in the body of the paper, and so far as they are there charged with stock it is evidence against them. As to the others it is not. They might, however, by other evidence be shown to have been stockholders. For any <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>ratification of said subscription when brought to their notice; accepting an office in the company under the charter; participating in its management, &amp;c., is all competent evidence to establish their connection with it.

The law allows no one to gain an advantage by his own faults.</p>
    <p id="b40-10" data-blocks='[["BL_40.12",40,[299,1527,1159,343]]]'>It seems that Weiss, Lippincott &amp; Miner had been engaged in the iron business, and had become embarrassed, and a scheme was got up by which most of their creditors were to take their whole establishment, form themselves into a corporation under the Act of 7th April 1849 and its supplements, take stock according to the amount of their several claims, discharge all remaining debts, and admit the original owners as stockholders for any surplus.</p>
    <p id="b40-11" data-blocks='[["BL_40.13",40,[297,1871,1159,510]],["BL_41.1",41,[123,419,1163,164]]]'>In pursuance of this scheme, a subscription paper was got up and stock to the amount of $100,000 was subscribed, and thereupon a certificate was made out, acknowledged, and recorded, certifying that stock to that amount had been taken, and that one-fourth of it had been paid in, and then a charter was obtained. Now the evidence is that this certificate was not true in form or substance; that many of the persons named as subscribers had not subscribed at all, though their names appeared as subscribers ; that no money at all had been paid in, but the company had taken the effects of Weiss, Lippincott &amp; Miner for their debts, at a valuation of $88,819; and that even the recorder had, at the instance of some one, altered the certificate at the <a id="p41" href="#p41" data-label="41" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*41</a>time of recording it. We need not mention <em>other </em>irregularities here; they will of course create difficulties among tbe corpora-tors themselves, but they ought not to be allowed to embarrass their creditors.</p>
    <p id="b41-4" data-blocks='[["BL_41.4",41,[124,592,1160,300]]]'>As matter of fact, the Mauch Chunk Iron Company was incorporated, carried on business, and ran in debt, and our business is to find out and apply the remedy, which the law gives to its creditors. The character and the application of the remedy were misunderstood by the court below; and we may correct the errors there made, by the statement of a few propositions, which cannot easily be misunderstood.</p>
    <p id="b41-5" data-blocks='[["BL_41.5",41,[125,892,1159,129]]]'>1. The charter of incorporation is <em>primd faeie </em>evidence that all the persons named therein were, at the commencement, members of the corporation.</p>
    <p id="b41-6" data-blocks='[["BL_41.6",41,[125,1022,1158,344]]]'>2. The charter and the previous certificate being public acts and publicly recorded, if any person named therein as a member, afterwards acts as a member, or does not disavow the relation as soon as he discovers the use made of his name, he cannot evade his liability as member, merely by showing that he was not in fact a subscriber, and never paid in any stock. He must immediately and publicly disavow the act, or else be deemed as ratifying it as relates to creditors.</p>
    <p id="b41-7" data-blocks='[["BL_41.7",41,[126,1364,1158,335]]]'>3. The fact that several persons named as members had judgments against W'eiss, Lippincott &amp; Miner, and that these judgments were satisfied by their attorney by stock of company, without his act being disavowed by his principals, is some evidence of their ratification of a subscription of stock made by him for them; not needed in chief, however, but rather by way of rebuttal, and in corroboration of the <em>primd facie </em>evidence of the charter.</p>
    <p id="b41-8" data-blocks='[["BL_41.8",41,[128,1709,1156,127]]]'>4. There was sufficient evidence that the ledger offered in evidence was the ledger of the company, and it was competent evidence of indebtedness to the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b41-9" data-blocks='[["BL_41.9",41,[128,1836,1158,300]]]'>5. The defendants cannot set up their own faults and mistakes in their own organization,as a defence against their creditors; and therefore it was quite immaterial and irrelevant to the issue, that no part of the stock had been paid (the fifth and sixth counts being unnecessary) and that any property which they were to have obtained from Weiss, Lippincott &amp; Miner was taken in execution and sold by the creditors of this firm.</p>
    <p id="b41-10" data-blocks='[["BL_41.10",41,[128,2136,1160,302]],["BL_42.1",42,[296,412,1162,257]]]'>6. The Act of Assembly expressly allows judgment to be recovered against any one or more of the stockholders claimed to be liable, and thus allows a departure in this, as well as in other respects, from the common law form of actions, and therefore the plaintiff may recover against such of the defendants as he proves to have been stockholders, though he may have also sued others whom he cannot prove to have been so. When this prin<a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>ciple is applied, it will be tbe interest of each defendant to allow no other one to evade bis liability unjustly; and thus there may be evidence that will clear up some of the bad appearances of the transaction. In a late case from Berks county, Wyomissing Company <em>v. </em>Grant, we have already given some further explanations of this Act of Assembly, which we need not repeat here.</p>
    <p id="b42-6" data-blocks='[["BL_42.4",42,[296,670,1155,120]]]'>We do not observe any other points in this case that need any discussion by us ; but what we have said shows that there must be a new trial of the case.</p>
    <p id="b42-7" data-blocks='[["BL_42.5",42,[648,798,759,43]]]'>Judgment reversed, and new trial ordered.</p>
