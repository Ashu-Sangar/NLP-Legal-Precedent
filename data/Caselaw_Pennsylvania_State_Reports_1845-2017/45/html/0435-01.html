That Orphans’ Court sales in partition are such judicial sales as discharge all liens is still a matter of doubt. That they are judicial sales to a certain extent, is established by Sa-cket <em>v. </em>Twining, 6 Harris 199. It was there held that such sales are judicial to the extent that the decree of. confirmation cannot be impugned collaterally except for fraud. The judge who delivered the opinion recognises the distinction between the case before him and Orphans’ Court sales for payment of debts, and says, ‘it is not the object of the sale, but the mode and manner, the action of the court, and the parties being called to judgment, which gives it character and makes it judicial.’ Nowhere in that opinion, or in any other that has been produced, has it been said that an Orphans’ Court sale in partition, made within two years after granting letters of administration, discharged the lien of decedent’s debts.</p>

But that the rights of creditors might be preserved, we have provided that such sale, to discharge the lien of debts, must be made after the expiration of two years from the granting of administration. At present the law does not forbid proceedings in partition being commenced immediately after the death of the ancestor, and the estate may therefore be sold within the year allowed for the settlement of the accounts. This ought not to be if the lien of the debts is to be. discharged. We think the addition of one year to that mentioned, to enable creditors to proceed against the land if they think fit, is requisite.’ See <em>Report of Commissioners, </em>Hood on Executors 529.
