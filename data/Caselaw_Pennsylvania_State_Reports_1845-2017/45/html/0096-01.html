Miller to Abraham Featherman, payable in one year with interest, for $606.07, upon which a payment on account of $194 was endorsed April 9th 1850. The second was brought to recover the amount of a bill single, dated April 10th 1849, executed by Depue S.

Plaintiff's intestate, who was a farmer, residing in Monroe county, and defendant who, was a merchant, living in Eas-ton, were nearly related, Abraham Featherman's wife being defendant's sister. The cases were submitted to arbitrators, who awarded for the defendant in the first, and for the plaintiff in the second suit.

The defendant asked for and obtained a new trial in each case. August 29th 1861, the cases were again called for trial, when the parties again agreed, with the consent of the court, to try them both before the same jury. August 30th 1861, the jury brought into court sealed verdicts, and being polled, the two first called disagreed in the amounts, and the third being unable to remember the amounts, failed to answer; whereupon the jury was dismissed by the court, plaintiff’s counsel objecting thereto. August 26th 1862, a jury being called, it was again agreed to try both cases before the same jury, which was done, and the jury returned a verdict in the first case in favour of the defendant, and in the other case in favour of the plaintiff for $491.83.

There was something said about a receipt, but can’t remember what it was. I don’t think the paper handed to Jacob Featherman was tied or wrapped up, it was folded up.

Although this receipt for $1050 does not declare that Abraham Featherman received that money on a note or notes which he had at home, yet you might fairly so presume without evidence of other transactions between these parties, it appearing by the two notes given in evidence that Featherman had them at the time the receipt was given. But the plaintiff contends that his intestate had another note against the defendant, Miller, to which this receipt was intended to apply; that he sent it down to Depue S. Miller by Jacob Featherman, requesting the return of this receipt; that Miller took the note from the messenger, but refused to give up the receipt, alleging that he had burnt or destroyed it. This, gentlemen, is the great dispute between these parties. It is a pure question of fact for you to decide from the testimony. It is your duty to decide it not upon mere surmise, but according to the evidence. We at first admitted Daniel Miller to testify his recollection of the message sent by <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>Abraham Featherman to Depue S. Miller by Jacob Featherman, upon the statement of plaintiff’s counsel that it would be followed up by testimony showing that the message as testified by Daniel Miller had been delivered by Jacob Featherman to D. S. Miller — but this proof did not sustain this statement. Jacob Featherman did not in <em>words </em>or <em>substance </em>tell D. S. Miller that A. Featherman had said that he had sent to him, Miller, a note <em>against him. </em>We, therefore, on the application of the defendant, struck out that part of Daniel Miller’s testimony, and it is therefore no longer before you. You have no right to consider it; you would do wrong to consider it; it should be as if never spoken. If it had not been stricken out, we would have felt it our duty to have called your attention to the fact that Jacob C. Featherman, according to his testimony, did not so hear the message. He to whom it was spoken did not, according to his testimony, hear anything said by Abraham Featherman about this note being against Depue S. Miller. If it had been .so said, would not he have been more likely to have heard it than one working some distance off, a mere uninterested listener ? [But, gentlemen, as we have said, no such message having been proved to have been delivered, this testimony has been stricken out, and you are to blot it from your recollection.] You, then, have the testimony of J. C. Featherman, whose credibility is for you, that Abraham Featherman requested him, Jacob Featherman, to take a note down, and give it to Depue S. Miller, at Easton, and ask for a receipt. He says, in substance, — you will recollect his words, — that Abraham Featherman gave him a note, requesting him to take it down to and give it to D. S. Miller, at Easton, and ask him for a receipt. That he took it down to Easton, and gave it to Miller, and asked him for a receipt, who would not give it, alleging that he had destroyed or burnt it. It is for you, gentlemen, to decide upon the credit you will give a witness. If his story is improbable, if he is shown to be biassed in feeling, or having a failing, uncertain recollection; if he has contradicted himself, or made other and different statements at other times, these all would properly weigh with you as to the effect you would allow his testimony. There is no direct testimony now before you, showing that the paper sent was a note <em>against Depue ¡3. Miller </em>— whether there is any from which you might properly infer that it was a <em>note at </em>all, we will speak subsequently. Is there testimony from which you can properly infer it ? To so conclude, you ought to be satisfied by <em>testimony </em>that convinces you, as intelligent men conversant with the transactions of <em>fellows. </em>You have heard the arguments of counsel on both sides in reference to this paper sent by Jacob Featherman, and the testimony generally. When they differ in their recollection as to the testimony given, you will decide according to your recol<a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>lection. While we desire you to understand that mere questions of fact are entirely for you, and the court does not desire to interfere, it may not be improper to say, that it seems to us certainly strange that if this receipt were to be applied to this alleged note sent by Abraham Featherman, and his messenger returned without it, that A. Featherman never seemed, as far as the testimony shows, to have concerned himself about it, although he lived some ■ eighteen months after, and must, in that event, have known that both note and receipt were in the hands of D. S. Miller, or <em>might </em>be. We.have no testimony that he ever complained to Miller about it, nor is there any evidence that Abraham Featherman ever held any other note against defendant than the two now given in evidence. The defendant has also offered evidence by Thomas J. Miller and James Moser, showing, as they contend, that Jacob Featherman at another time either told another story or showed a forgetfulness and want of recollection and knowledge as to what he has testified to. They have also read from the notes of testimony at former trials, showing, as they contend, that he has made different statements at different trials. We repeat, gentlemen, that the credibility of all the witnesses is for you. The plaintiff also urges the testimony of Simpson Featherman as to D. S. Miller’s admission of indebtedness soon after the death of the father of the witness. This should receive your due consideration. The law upon his assignment and transfer of his interest in his father’s estate made him a competent witness, leaving however his credibility under the position he has occupied and his testimony as given entirely for you. We sum up, then, gentlemen, are you satisfied from the whole testimony that this receipt should not be credited on these notes, or does the testimony convince you, satisfy you, that this $1050 receipt relates to another transaction or another note ? If you find that this receipt ought to be credited on these notes, then you will find in favour of the defendant in the first suit, and then deducting the balance of the receipt, having deducted therefrom the amount of the first note less the payments, and making proper interest calculations, and this order of $48 from the second note, render a verdict in the second suit for the plaintiff for what is yet due him. You will have the calculations of both parties.</p>

So that never having opened it, he could not have read it. [This paper, he testified, he handed to Miller, only asking for a receipt.

Then the defendant, under his plea of payment, gave in evidence the receipt of Abraham Eeatherman, dated the 7th of April 1851, acknowledging the payment to him of $1050, and also rested. About this receipt was the whole controversy in the case, the defendant insisting on its application in discharge of the notes <em>pro tanto, </em>and the plaintiff denying it. If the pleading had been special, this would have been the only issue. To rebut this evidence, the plaintiff set up and undertook to show that the receipt grew out of a different transaction ; that it was given by the intestate for money received on another note surrendered a few days after the date of the receipt. To establish this, he called Jacob Eeatherman, and <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>proved by bim -that on one occasion, when he was going to Easton, Abraham Eeatherman gave him a note, to use his own language, “to take down and give it to Depue S.

This was the plaintiff’s theory, and he was entitled to make it out if he could. Every part of the transaction, during its progress towards completion, was evidence on the principle that it was <em>res gestes. “ </em>The affairs of men,” says Greenleaf on Ev., vol. 1, § 108, “consist of a complication of circumstances so intimately interwoven as to be hardly separable from each other.” “ These surrounding circumstances, constituting parts of the <em>res </em>gestee, may always be shown to the jury with the principal fact.” Here the principal fact alleged was the delivery of a note and the demand of a receipt. As the party constituted an agent to do this for him, his declarations in the shape of instructions were evidence; they were a part of the very fact, and provable as part of the <em>res gestee. </em>Declarations made at the time, are part of the transaction, and are proper as evidence on this principle: <a href="/ala/9/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Ala. 382" data-case-ids="3042321" data-case-paths="/ala/9/0382-01">9 Ala. 382</a>.

All the authorities sustain this. The court permitted all this to be proved by the agent himself, but struck out the proof of instructions by a bystander. I do not quite realize the distinction taken by the learned judge. If the evidence was such as might be given by one, any other disinterested witness ought, I should think, to be able to give it also. That it was competent to be given by either or both, after proof that the errand was done, or proposed to be-<a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>shown to be done, we have no doubt. It was part of the <em>res gestee. </em>That the errand was not satisfactorily performed as exhibited in the proof, was no reason for striking out the evidence, provided there was enough disclosed to submit the question of whether it was substantially done or not. We think the testimony should have gone to tire jury on this ground, and we are of opinion, therefore, that there was error in striking out the testimony of Daniel Miller.</p>
    <p id="b104-4" data-blocks='[["BL_104.4",104,[283,741,1167,854]]]'>2. The second assignment of error is also sustained. The fact that the people of Monroe county, where Abraham Eeatherman and his messenger lived, sometimes sent notes to the firm of which the defendant was a member, and a director of a bank, to get them discounted, rebutted nothing which the witness said, nor did it raise any presumption that the note alleged to have been sent by Abraham Featherman was for such a purpose ; for-it was not found that he was in the habit of doing so, or did so on any occasion. Certainly there was not a shadow of ground to suppose that the note sent was for some one else. The testimony was clearly incompetent. If we could believe that the testimony was harmless, we would not make it a ground of reversal. But of this we cannot feel assured. It might, in a case where a witness possessed no more intelligence than the messenger in this case displayed, be with plausibility and force argued that the note he carried was for some Monroe county applicant for a loan from the Bank of Easton. A jury might be taken by the argument, inasmuch as it had the judicial sanction in its admission, and suppose that it was good for some purpose. We think it was erroneously admitted.</p>

We cannot agree to this. The principal reason given for the charge on this point seems to be, that the witness did not say when he handed the note, or rather could not remember whether he said it was a note or not. Now whether he did so or not, was susceptible of proof by other means than the abstract recollection of the words used by the witness when he presented it. The reply might disclose what was said. Was it not such as from which an inference, aided by the facts in the case, might be drawn that it was a note, and also that it was a note in lieu of which a receipt had been given, and which was now surrendered for the purpose of taking it up ? What was the answer to what was said by the messenger ? It was that the receipt was destroyed or burnt. This certainly <a id="p105" href="#p105" data-label="105" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*105</a>implied that it once existed; and did it' not imply also that the equivalent of the note he received was asked for, as he refused it on the ground that an exchange was impossible, because the receipt was destroyed? We do not mean to occupy the jury-box and draw inferences; but we think this evidence, together with the fact that a receipt was given seven days before by Featherman to Miller, and the allegation that a receipt had been burnt, without showing why it was burnt or for what given, should all have gone to the jury, on the question raised whether or not the receipt produced was not in fact the one demanded in exchange for the note. The omission to show anything corroborative of the allegation by the defendant that there was a receipt which had been burnt, if the evidence that he made this excuse was believed, was a circumstance to be considered by the jury. The saying is true undoubtedly, in some cases, that evidence consists not only of what is proved, but of what is not proved. To some extent we think it true here. But we have said as much as is necessary and proper, as this case goes back for retrial, to show that, in our opinion, there was error as alleged in the two specific assignments in the charge. The third assignment is for general errors, and this we do not notice.</p>
