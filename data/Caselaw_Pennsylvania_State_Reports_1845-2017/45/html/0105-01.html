It is drawn to Edwin F. Richmond, and sets forth that the redemption is made to him as a minor heir. The evidence shows that the money paid was furnished by two of the defendants in this suit (Messrs. Chadwick &amp; Freeman), and that at the time it was paid to the treasurer Edwin F. Richmond had no title to or interest in the land; that on the 4th of March 1859, after he <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>had attained his majority, he and his elder brother, William H.

R. Chadwick, for and on behalf of himself and Seneca Freeman, under an agreement between them and Brewster, who- was the owner of the Richmond title, and was present at the time, and authorized them to redeem. It is not alleged by the defendants that the payment made to the treasurer on the 19th December 1859, as shown by the receipt, redeemed any other interest than that of Edwin F. Richmond. It is conceded that the undivided fourth to which William Henry Richmond was entitled was not redeemed, and that the equity of redemption thereto having been permitted to expire without payment of the redemption-money, the plaintiffs have title to, and should recover, this undivided fourth. But it is alleged that no recovery can be had of the interest which belonged to Edwin F. Richmond, that having been redeemed, nor of the interest which belonged to Franklin 0. and Emma I. Richmond, they being still minors, and having still the right to redeem their interest separately at any time within two years after attaining the ages of twenty-one years. It is a conclusive answer to this position that the evidence shows that Edwin F. Richmond had divested himself of all title or ownership in the land before the alleged redemption had been made, and that Franklin 0. Richmond and Emma I. Richmond have no interest or ownership which authorizes them to redeem, their interest having been vested in Brewster Freeman by sale in the Orphans’ Court, and conveyed by their guardian.</p>

Chadwick of the title which had previously belonged to these minor children of Judge Richmond, carried with it the privilege which the law gave them to redeem, and that this may be exercised by him at any time during which it would have been competent for them to exercise it. We do not concur in this position. We regard this privilege as a personal one, and conferred by the Act of Assembly upon the minor alone, and for his benefit. The alleged redemption of the 19th December 1859, was void, because, at the time it was made, Brewster Freeman was the owner of the interest which wras proposed to be redeemed, and had no right to appropriate to himself a personal privilege <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>conferred on E.

Prior to the passage of the Act of 9th March 1847, one joint tenant, or tenant in common, could not redeem his individual interest in a tract of land. Being a joint owner, he must redeem the whole tract, and the redemption thus made would enure to the benefit of his co-tenant as well as to his own. The 3d section of the Act of the 9th March 1847, authorizes joint tenants, tenants in common, as copartners of unseated lands sold for taxes to redeem their interests, but it does not authorize them to redeem less than. their entire interests. There is no Act of Assembly, or adjudication of the Supreme Court, which authorizes an owner of a tract of unseated land, whether he is sole owner or the owner of an individual part, to redeem less than his entire interest in the tract. [The redemption, therefore, relied upon by defendants to defeat plaintiffs’ tax title, acquired through treasurer’s sale in 1848 and 1850, is regarded by the court as a nullity,] and those sales being regular, and the title under them vested in plaintiffs, the jury are directed to render a verdict in favour of plaintiffs for the whole tract.”</p>

A careful study of the agreement, however, discloses no such trust.

He did nothing towards the recovery of lands under this agreement, that we discover, but purchased out the interest of the Richmond estate in them, as the agreement contemplated might he done by him, at an Orphans’ Court sale in 1859, and received the guardians’ deed therefor, dated the 5th of March 1859. He had received from the two heirs who were of age, a conveyance of their interest the day before. After this, and on the 28th of February 1860, Freeman conveyed the land in controversy to Chadwick, under whom the defendants below claimed, but it is alleged that he paid no part of the purchase-money until after the present ejectment was brought to June Term 1860. As none of the evidence has been brought up, and it would have been more satisfactory had it been, we take the uncontradicted statement as true, that the purchase-money was paid as stated. This perhaps took away the defendants’ equity as innocent purchasers without notice, and forced them to lean upon the right of the heirs to redeem the tax sales of 1848 and 1850, under which the plaintiff claimed. What was this right ?</p>
    <p id="b112-8" data-blocks='[["BL_112.4",112,[277,1591,1165,774]]]'>After the Orphans’ Court sale, and the conveyances already noticed, no title, legal or equitable, remained in the heirs. No trust for any portion of the land for their benefit existing in Freeman, as already stated, and the legal title being gone, they could not redeem. It appears that on the 19th of December 1859, I suppose within two years after his majority, for the evidence is not given nor the fact stated, Edwin F. Richmond paid the redemption-money of one undivided fourth of the tract to the treasurer. But as he had conveyed his title away on the 4th of March previously, he had no right to redeem, and this abortive attempt in his own name could not avail any one else, for he did not act for any other. This, therefore, went for nothing. As the purchasers of the Richmond title did not attempt to redeem, we need not discuss the question of how far a purchaser of a minor’s estate is invested with his right to redeem. No redemption was attempted on that ground. We think, therefore, under these circumstances, there was no error committed in the rejection of the agreement of the 15th April 1857.</p>

But this view is erroneous. That limitation has no operation against a subsequent tax title. To giye it such an effect, would be to render invulnerable such a title against after-sales for taxes. This we all know is not the case. Its operation’is only applicable to the holder of the prior title: <a href="/watts-serg/5/0465-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 465" data-case-ids="478825" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0465-01">5 W. &amp; S. 465</a>; 9 Barr 71. The Crary title is in the hands of the plaintiffs, and was not relied on as the foundation of a recovery by the plaintiffs below, so far as we can discover. We see nothing to correct in this record, and</p>
