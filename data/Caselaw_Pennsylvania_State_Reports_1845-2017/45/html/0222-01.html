If the defendant did not intend to accept the draft, why write anything at all on it ? The legal effect of the words employed is tantamount to a waiver of presentment. He had no right to waive acceptance, for the non-acceptance would not affect him in any event. This might have been done by the drawer, for acceptance or non-acceptance might concern him. The right of having the draft accepted belonged to the plaintiff, and with what show of justice could the defendant waive the rights of another ? The clear duty of the defendant was to accept or not accept, and his act in the premises should be construed to mean one of these results. To produce the latter, no mark or writing was at all necessary. Hence the former is to be presumed. At all events, the words are of doubtful meaning in the relation in which they were used; and to solve that doubt was the office of the jury, unless the letters in evidence clearly implied no acceptance. There is nothing in them which shows that the plaintiffs meant to treat the acceptance as a nullity; they merely object to the form. It was unusual, and hence rendered the draft unmarketable ; but that they meant to hold it for what it was worth, may be inferred from the letters, and from the fact that they did not protest the draft. If, in legal effect, the words are an acceptance, nothing short of conduct on the part of the plaintiffs equivalent to a release, would exonerate the defendant from liability. The letters show dissatisfaction, but it nowhere appears that they meant to exonerate the defendant. If, as is contended by defendant’s counsel, the words meant “ acceptance postponed,” it was neither an acceptance or refusal to accept, but the retention of the privilege of accepting or not. If so, was he not bound to give notice to the plaintiffs of his ultimate determination? He arrested the legal operation of the draft by his special agreement with the plaintiffs, and as his ultimate determination not. to accept could only be known to the plaintiffs by notice, his failure to give that notice should be construed into an acceptance; especially as his conduct stayed the action of the plaintiffs until it was too late to protest the draft.</p>

To constitute an acceptance, there must be some circumstance whence it may be inferred that the drawee imagined he had induced the holder to consider the bill as accepted (Bentwick <em>v. </em>Doorein, 6 East 201), and the whole of the circumstances must be taken together, and there must be evidence of a contract to charge a party as acceptor: Clavey <em>v. </em>Dolbin, Rep.

Hardw. 75, in note), or an answer given by the drawee when the bill is called for, <em>“ </em>There is your bill; it is all right” (Powell <em>v. </em>Jones, 1 Esp.

These were merely qualified, and to this extent: the insertion of the words created between the drawers and the payef, and those subsequently taking the bill, an agreement that .the drawees should not be required to accept the bill upon its sight. Without these words, it would have been the holder’s right to insist upon an acceptance upon presentment, protest the bills, if acceptance were refused, and take his immediate recourse against the drawers; with them, he had only the right to exhibit the bill for sight, in order to fix the date for maturity, which was done, and was bound to wait until the maturity for payment by the drawees, at which time the drawer engaged it should be paid by the drawees. Upon failure of payment, protest, and notice, the liability of the drawers, which was previously conditional, would in general become absolute: no adjudged case, militating with this view of the rights of these parties, has been referred to by the district judge, or cited in argument here by the plaintiff; and we are satisfied that the construction we give would be in accordance with the understanding of men of business, and meets the understanding of the parties themselves when the bill was drawn and negotiated.
