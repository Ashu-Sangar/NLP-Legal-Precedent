Anderson, praying for a <em>mandamus </em>against the School Directors of the Borough of Bedford, commanding them to exonerate and discharge him from the payment of the school-tax assessed upon moneys at interest secured by a mortgage on the real estate of the Bedford Mineral Spring Company.</p>

Second, because the company is insolvent, and unable to pay the interest on the mortgage, and has been so for more than one year, and before the taxes were assessed.</p>

That the fact of its not being paid regularly is no reason why the tax should be exonerated. The mortgage is for $100,000. The property on which it is secured was sold by Mr. Anderson to the company for $170,000. The company made improvements afterwards to the extent of $50,000. The tax was levied and paid prior years without objection. The interest upon the mortgage is receipted for, on the record, for the time including 1860. Mr. Anderson obtained judgment for the interest due 1st April 1861, issued execution, and sold a large amount of personal property to pay it. The tax complained of was included in duplicate of 1861. The collector’s warrant has expired, and he is responsible on his bond. The teachers for the schools were employed, the schools opened, and other expenses incurred — the debts contracted must be paid for — they were made on the faith of this tax, in part; there can be no good reason for taking the debt off Mr. Anderson and putting it upon the other tax-payers of the borough. The directors can authorize an abatement or exoneration only upon three contingencies,- to wit, for mistakes, indigent persons, or unseated lands. This tax was laid 3d May 1861; up to that day Mr. Anderson had received every cent of interest due on his mortgage. Upon the judgment confessed for the interest falling due 1st April 1861, Mr. Anderson bought in nearly the whole of the personal property at a sacrifice of two-thirds, certainly one-half of its value.”</p>

L. Anderson, Esq., holds against the Bedford Mineral Springs Company, no interest was paid for the year 1861, because of the insolvency of said company. This being the case, Anderson should not have been assessed with school tax on said mortgage for 1861. Therefore the rule issued is made absolute, and it is ordered and decreed by the court that a writ of <em>mandamus </em>shall be issued against the school directors of said borough of Bedford, commanding them to exonerate and discharge said Anderson from the payment of said school tax for the year 1861.”</p>

    <p id="b390-6" data-blocks='[["BL_390.9",390,[320,826,1167,504]]]'>This was an unprecedented application of the writ of <em>mandamus. </em>It is not the ordinary official duty of school directors to exonerate taxes, but rather to levy and collect them. If they were backward in the exercise of this official function, <em>mandamus </em>might be used to stir them up. But when they have set themselves in motion, and are proceeding to discharge the duty imposed by law, they are no longer subject to <em>mandamus. </em>Exoneration is a discretionary power incidental to their office, and in this instance would seem to have been exercised by a refusal to grant the relief asked for. We have no power to control a discretion vested in them, and no appeal lies from them to judicial tribunals.</p>
