Hecker, Esq., to take testimony and report the facts, who reported that “two school districts (the Cowan and Blooming Valley) adjoining each other were consolidated into one last spring and summer by the respondents, refusing to allow a school in the Valley. This was opposed by the complainants. There was no school in the Valley last summer. There is one now, which commenced last December. There is a sufficient number of pupils in the valley to warrant a school there as well in the summer-time as in the winter-time, and a house large and convenient enough to accommodate them. This district was made in 1851, and teachers employed there from that time till last summer, when the school in the Valley was united with the Cowan district. The distance from the Valley to the Cowan house is increased from a half to three-quarters of a mile. A <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>number of families in tbe Valley were without a school last summer on account of this arrangement. There are no graded schools in this township. The directors of this township, in several instances heretofore, have consolidated districts in the summer-time, where no objections were made. The Cowan house is a larger, newer, and better house than the Valley house. The Valley house is a good second-class frame house, and convenient for all pupils of the Valley. Exhibits of the average number of pupils attending these schools were returned, and made a part of his report. A large majority of the citizens of the Valley desired a school there last summer. The Valley school is one of the largest in the township.”</p>

What they complain of is not the refusal or neglect of all the directors of Woodcock township to perform their duties, but of the manner of performance. They consolidated the schools of Blooming Valley and of the Cowan House for the summer of 1861. This was the wrong complained of.</p>

There is some ground to doubt the legal existence of sucia a sub-district as that of Blooming Valley, but if it were a legally existing district, there was no hardship in taking its pupils into the adjoining district for the summer, where the average attendance of both the schools did not exceed thirty-four, and the utmost distance that any pupil had to travel was a mile and a half. That number of scholars is not unreasonable for a single school, nor is that distance excessive over a good summer road.</p>
