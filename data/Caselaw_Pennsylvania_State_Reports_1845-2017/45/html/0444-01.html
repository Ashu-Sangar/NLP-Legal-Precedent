If there is any evidence before you that these entries were copied from other books, and manufactured out of other books, it will be your duty to disregard the books.

In not affirming the defendant’s 6th point, which was as follows: “That books of original entries are at best a dangerous kind of evidence, and are admissible on grounds of necessity, and not of convenience. As evidence on a trial they are barely competent, and although they often afford perfectly satisfactory evidence, yet, being the act of the party using them, and affording extraordinary facilities to the practice of deception, in a way that renders detection difficult, they are entitled to no peculiar protection, but are liable to have their credibility impeached by every legal means in the power of the opposite party.” Which the court answered thus: “Books of original entries are by law evidence for goods and merchandise sold and delivered, or for any other kind of articles sold and delivered by a persop in the line of his business, or for work and labour done. [And if the entries aré made within two days after the articles were sold and delivered, (in one case a book was held good when the entry was made on the third day after), they are reliable evidence.

In not affirming the defendant’s last point, which was as follows : “ If the jury believe the books produced at the trial by the plaintiffs, purporting to be their books of original entries, to be the books proven to have been purchased of T. J. Wright in December 1860, then said books cannot be the books of original entries of the plaintiffs,-inasmuch as they contain charges purporting to have been made years prior to the date of said purchase from Wright; and that in such case they must find for the defendant, or no more against the defendant than he admitted to be due, unless plaintiffs have proven their claim by testimony apart from the books themselves.” Which the court answered thus: “The law would be correctly stated in this point if supported by the facts, but we leave it to you to say whether the proof does show that these books were bought at T. J. Wright’s. [To our mind the evidence proves that these books were not purchased from Mr. Wright.”] The language enclosed in brackets is objected to particularly.</p>

In using the following language in his general charge, to wit: “ There has in the discussion been something said about the general character of Solomon Ely. On this we would say to you, that the defendants had every legal opportunity of impeaching the general character of the books, and of Solomon Ely in connection with them, but no evidence was offered on that question, and for that reason his reputation is unassailed in that respect before you.”</p>

The rest at other times. One said a 42 cent charge was, when he saw it a second time, made $2. There is no evidence that this account was embraced in it.

If he was challenged peremptorily, after the peremptory challenges allowed by law had been exhausted, it was, if possible, even more erroneous. It is difficult to determine, from the conflicting statements before us, how the fact was, but it is immaterial, for whichever way the fact was, there was no exception to it. What was excepted to, was the court’s refusal to allow the defendant peremptorily to challenge the new juror called in Gordon’s place, four peremptory challenges having been already enjoyed by the defendant. In this there was no error. The court could not give the defendant five peremptory challenges, the statute having allowed him but four.</p>
    <p id="b448-9" data-blocks='[["BL_448.11",448,[305,1297,1165,599]]]'>The only error we see upon the record is in excluding from the, jury all evidence tending to impeach Ely’s books, except such as related to the account against Funk. Such a rule of evidence amounts to nothing in its practical application. If a defendant can disprove his particular account, he has no occasion to assail the general character of the plaintiff’s books. It is only when he has no other means of meeting a false charge, that he assails the general character of the plaintiff’s book, in the same manner in which he would assail the general character of a witness for truth and veracity, whose particular statement he could not controvert. The plaintiff who swears to his original book of entries, puts his general character for truth and veracity, and the general character of his book for honesty and accuracy, in evidence, and invites attack upon either or both.</p>

When a ook of original entries is offered in evidence, supported by the oath of the party, the court examines it to see if it appears, <em>primá facie, </em>to be whaf.it purports to be. If there are erasures and interlineations, and false or impossible dates, touching points that are material, or if for any reason it clearly appears not to be a legal book of entries, the court may reject it as incompetent: Churchman <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/whart/6/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Whart. 146" data-case-ids="1836941" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0146-01">6 Whart. 146</a>; Curren <em>v. </em>Crawford, 4 S. &amp; R. 3. If this does not clearly appear, it is to be submitted to the jury to judge of, and then it is competent for the adverse party to show its general character by pointing to charges and <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>entries affecting other parties, and bj calling witnesses to prove such entries false and fraudulent. That this investigation may not run into excessive departure from the issue on trial, the court should limit it to the time, or near the time, covered by the account in suit, and should suffer no more examination of collateral cases than would bear directly on the general character of the book. If a shop-book exhibit, in respect to customers generally, illegal dates, as on Sunday, or impossible dates, as 31st of June or 30th February, or altered dates, or earlier dates after those that are later, or any other such condemning features, they are evidence for the jury upon the general character of the book. The jury may form some opinion from such examination, how far it is entitled to weight in the scales which they are holding. Whilst they should make all due allowances for mistakes, for ignorance and unskilfulness in book-keeping, and for peculiarities in the plaintiffs’ business, they should insist on the general honesty and accuracy of the book, made in secret by one party against the othei’, and now offered as a guide to the conscience of the jury.</p>
