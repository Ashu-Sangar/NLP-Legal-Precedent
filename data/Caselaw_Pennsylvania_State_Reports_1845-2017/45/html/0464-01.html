An order, under seal, on one person to pay money to another, is not, of itself, evidence of a promise or contract by the drawerto pay the payee the amount mentioned in it: for, there being no express promise in it, no consideration could be implied, as it was not negotiable; and as it did not purport to be “for value received,'” the payee could not, for that reason, recover upon it.</p>

There is no pretence by defendants that he did anything more than promise to settle it. Settle it, they say, by crediting it on these notes. This allegation depends on the testimony of John Berk-heimer and Alexander King. Does this testimony satisfy you that Sidle agreed to settle this order by applying it as, a credit on these notes? In considering this question, the jury will remember-these facts: Sidle held three notesthe two in suit against the defendants jointly, and one against James M. Anderson, upon which he had credited the $88, the price of the dun mare. No other notes are shown.- Anderson had, besides this order, a book account. If the jury are satisfied that the Mor-risson order was the one testified about by Berkheimer and King, and that he agreed to settle with James M. Anderson <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>when he had time, they will inquire what was to be settled ? Was it some accounts between the defendant and deceased son of Henry Sidle ? If it was, it is not shown that -Anderson owed Samuel W. Sidle or his estate anything. What was to be settled with the order, the jury will determine from all the facts of the case. Did the plaintiff mean to agree that the order was to liquidate the notes in suit ? If from his conversation and all the facts of the case, the jury conclude that Sidle agreed that these notes should be liquidated by the order, having made that arrangement he would be bound by it, and the jury will credit the amount of it on the notes in suit.”</p>

As, therefore, it was not an express promise to tbe payee for value to pay him tbe face of it in default of payment by tbe party on whom it was drawn, and its nature not being such as to imply a consideration out of which tbe law would also imply a promise to pay, we think it was not evidence alone to charge tbe plaintiff with tbe amount.

The plaintiff brought suit against the defendant in his own right. To this the defendant pleaded set-off, and offered the order in question in evidence to support his plea. It was the order of Samuel W. Sidle, deceased, drawn in his lifetime, on one Morrisson, in favour of the defendant. The plaintiff was the administrator of his son’s estate; had settled his administration account, without a knowledge of the defendant’s claim, and handed over the balance of the estate to the widow of the deceased. This was shown by the defendant to establish a <em>devastavit </em>by the administrator, because as he was entitled as heir of his son, who died without children, to the one-half of it, and had not only paid that away to the widow, but paid over her share without a refunding bond, this seemed to be necessary proof to sustain his position. It was therefore not possible to claim that the promise was made on account of assets. The proof showed there was none. But it rested on the supposed proof of a <em>devastavit, </em>which it was assumed was the consideration <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>for the promise to pay the order. If there was a promise by the administrator to be personally liable, it had no other consideration than that implied in the allegation of an existing <em>devastavit. </em>There was no <em>express </em>promise to pay on any such ground, and the case of Wilson <em>v. </em>Long, 12 S. &amp; R. 59, very clearly determines that no implied contract to pay arises out of a <em>devastavit. </em>This would be decisive of the case on grounds independent of the statute. But suppose the promise rested on this ground expressly. It would be a promise by the administrator to answer the “ damage out of his own estate,” for “ the debt of another and this would certainly be within the statute, and not binding for want of a writing to that effect. We think the contrary view taken by the learned court was error ; and for both these reasons this judgment must be reversed. We do not deem it necessary to notice other points in the case, as those already noticed cover the whole ground.</p>
