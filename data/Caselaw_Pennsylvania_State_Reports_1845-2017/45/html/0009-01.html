There is no difficulty in discovering the intention of the testator in this case. The great and leading idea and intent of the will is the creation of a perpetually increasing fund. This is declared in express terms. The support of the college, the increasing the efficacy of the police of Philadelphia, the improvement of the property and general appearance of the city, while they are the three great objects to which his bounty is directed, and of which the college is the chief, yet they all are made subordinate to the creation of the fund, by the income alone of which they are to be sustained.</p>

The testator, in the plainest terms that can be formed from the words of the English language, stated his intention that “the income of the fund,” not any component part of the fund itself, shall yearly and every year be applied first to the college, if required, and then to the city to improve the city property and general appearance of the city. The fund was the reservoir into which the proceeds of the sale of the lands and the rents were to be deposited as they accrued to be invested, to produce and increase that income which was annually and every year to be applied to the purposes of the police, and to improve the property and general appearance of the city, unless required for the further improvement and maintenance of the college. The testator’s intention was clearly that the rents and proceeds of sales of lands should not be directly <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>applied in tbe same manner as the income of the great residuary fund. Every clause showed that the testator clearly understood the difference between giving for the use of an object and creating a fund, the interest of which alone was to be appropriated to the object. He has made a broad distinction between the uses and purposes of the real estate and the uses and purposes of the rents of the real estate. It was clearly his intention that the rents should not be expended, but invested; The uses and purposes of the real estate are not the same as the uses and purposes declared of concerning the personal estate, neither were the uses and purposes of the rents, as they accrued from the real estate, the same as the uses and purposes that were declared of and concerning the personal estate, for the rents were first to be applied to the payment of annuities, then to the building on and improving the real estate in the city of Philadelphia, and the net residue was then to be applied to the same uses and purposes as were declared of and concerning the personal estate; and those uses and purposes it has been shown were the creation of the fund.</p>

It was this remainder, including the residue of the remainder of the personal property, and the accumulations of the rents of the devised real estate which formed the fund, the income of which annually and every year, unless required by the want of the college, could be appropriated to city purposes, that was to be taken from the city and given to the state. When this contingency should occur, then the rents of the real estate in the city and county of Philadelphia that should thereafter accrue, instead of being paid into the fund as before (and which was then no longer to exist for the purpose of accumulation and producing income to sustain the college and the two city trusts), were to be applied directly to maintain the 'college alone, in the manner directed in the last paragraph of the 21st clause of the will. The intention was manifest and plainly expressed that a fund should be created out of the residue of the personal estate, the proceeds of sales of the Louisiana and Kentucky lands, and the rents of the inalienable Pennsylvania lands, the interest only of which was to be applied to the three great objects of the testator’s bounty, the college and the police, and the improvement of the property and general appearance of the city. The fund was also to be increased by adding to it the unexpended income. This construction of the will harmonized the whole. As soon as the fund was created and income from it accrued, such income, annually and every year, could be applied as directed by the testator, and the unexpended’interest and income thereof could <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>be invested from time to time, and tbns add to tbe principal, and increase the annual income. The college and the city could immediately enjoy the bequest by receiving their shares respectively of the income, while the rents and proceeds of the sales of land and unexpended income, if any, were at the same time increasing the capital of the fund.</p>

The testator had made a distinction between the trusts and the conditions upon which the property could be held by the trustee for the purposes of the trust. This restriction on alienation was not a condition: 2 Cruise’s Dig. 4; 1 Inst. 201 a; Findlay <em>v. </em>King, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Pet.%20373" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="3 Pet. 373">3 Pet.

No trust could vest contrary to the policy of the law: Hilliard <em>v. </em>Miller, 10 Barr 335. The trust that no part of the land should ever be sold or alienated, created a perpetuity, such as the law abhorred. A perpetuity is an estate unalienable, though all mankind join in the conveyance: Scattergood <em>v. </em>Edge, 1 Salk. 229; 12 Mod. 257; 2 Bl. Com. 174. The city of Philadelphia can hold no part of the real estate under the will of Stephen Girard. The title vested in the heirs at the death of Stephen Girard, and they have done no act since his death to divest the title, or to bar their right of possession to the lands claimed. The title that descended to the heirs, at the instant of the death of their ancestor, was the legal title, as fully and entirely as it was held by him in his life, or could have been devised or conveyed by any assurance known to the law. This title, thus cast upon them, could only be divested by the probate of a valid will containing a valid devise to some person other than the heirs at <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>law, or by the acts of the heirs after the death of their ancestor. A devise is not necessary to create or confirm the title of the heirs, for they held by descent a title paramount to the will. The devisee derived his title under the will, and the burthen of proof is upon him to show that the devise is valid, and that it divested the title of the heir to the land. The presumption of law was in favour of the heir, and not in favour of the devisee. The objection that the heirs at law have already received legacies under the will, amounts to nothing. It is based upon an erroneous application of the doctrine of election. That doctrine can only be called into exercise when a testator gave what did not belong to him: 2 Roper on Legacies 1567, 1582; 3 Mylne &amp; Keene 262. This case was not within either the letter or spirit of that rule. When the obligation arises from the insufficiency of the execution of the will, or its invalidity, there is no case obliging the legatee to make an election: Hearle <em>v. </em>Greenbank, 1 Yes. Sr. 306; Gardiner <em>v. </em>Fell, 2 Wils. C. Rep. 44; The Case of Warren <em>v. </em>Rudd all, 1 Johns. &amp; Hem.. 1, 10, 12, are directly in point, and decisive of the cause at bar.</p>

The law allows the vesting of an estate or interest, or the power of alienation, to be postponed, and the accumulation of its ^-increase to be made previous to vesting, for the period of lives <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>in being, and twenty-one years and nine months thereafter, and all restraints upon the vesting, that may suspend it beyond that period, are treated as perpetual restraints, and therefore as void, and consequently the estates or interests dependent on them are void; and nothing is denounced by the law as a perpetuity that does not transgress this rule. And equity follows this rule by way of analogy, in dealing with executory trusts, and those trusts which transgress the rule it calls transgressive trusts, being in equity the substantial equivalent of what in law are called perpetuities: Fearne on Rem. 538, n.; 6 Cruise 466, 478; 4 Ves.

But it is not improper to go further, in order to show that even if the restraints objected to are unlawful, they do not invalidate the gift, and we do so.</p>

It is a rule of law and equity, that where a vested estate is distinctly given, and there are annexed to it conditions, limitations, powers, trusts (including trusts for accumulation), or other restraints relative to its use, management, or disposal, that are not allowed by law, it is these restraints, and the estates limited on them, that are void, and not the principal or vested estate : 2 Ves. &amp; B. 54, 57 n.; 1 Sid. 301; 2 Peere Wms. 369; 1 Vern. 160; 1 Mylne &amp; C. 135; 2 Russell &amp; M. 301; 2 Keene 757; 2 Beavan 226, 362; 8 Id. 576; 9 Jurist 792; 2 Meriv. 362; 11 Ves. 25; 2 Swanst. 432; 14 Simons 230, 369; 8 Eng.

Possibly some of the directions given for the management of this charity are very unreasonable and even impracticable; but this does not annul the gift. The rule of equity on this subject seems to be clear, that when a definite charity is created, the failure of the particular mode in which it is to be effectuated does not destroy the charity, for equity will substitute another <a id="p28" href="#p28" data-label="28" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*28</a>mode, so that the substantial intention shall not depend on the insufficiency of the formal intention : 7 Ves. 69; 4 Id. 329; 14 Simons 232; 17 S. &amp; R. 91; 1 M. &amp; W. 287.</p>

But a reasonable doctrine, by which a well-defined charity, or one where the means of definition are given, may be enforced in favour of the general intent, even where the mode or means provided for by the donor fail by reason of their inadequacy or unlawfulness.</p>

The meaning of the doctrine of <em>cy </em>pres, as received by us, is, that when a definite function or duty is to be performed, and it cannot be done in exact conformity with the scheme of the person or persons who have provided for it, it must be performed with as close <em>approximation </em>to that scheme as reasonably practicable ; and so, of course, it must be enforced. It is the doctrine of approximation, and it is not at all confined to the administration of charities, but is equally applicable to all devises and contracts wherein the future is provided for, and it is an essential element of equity jurisprudence.</p>

But suppose that some of the directions given for the management of the charity are conditions; they are not conditions of the vesting of the principal charity, or in the happening of which the fund is to revert to the donor and his heirs, but upon which a new charity is depending. They would, therefore, on the showing of the claimants here, be void conditions of the new charity, because they may not happen within the time allowed for the vesting of executory devises, and therefore could not divest the already vested charity. Their character is such as to avoid rather the substitutionary charities than the principal and vested ones. Many of the cases already cited show this.</p>
    <p id="b28-9" data-blocks='[["BL_28.8",28,[257,2093,1157,255]]]'>It seems to us, therefore, very clear, that the heirs of the testator have shown no fatal defect in the form of this gift, and it follows, of course, that we need not say how far the directions against a limitation, and for accumulation, and relative to the general and special management of the fund, are binding upon the trustee, because the case is decided without this.</p>

It is supposed that the decision in Peter Miller’s will (10 <a id="p29" href="#p29" data-label="29" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*29</a>Parr 326) furnishes some support to tli'e case of tbe heirs here; but we do not think so. Though the will in that case appears to have been copied in some of its parts from this one, there is no legal analogy between the two. ' In Peter Miller’s will no charity at all was founded by the principal trust; but only a loan office for the benefit of farmers and mechanics, at the usual rate of interest, on real estate security, with continually accumulating capital, so long as there should be farmers and mechanics desiring,to borrow; and “if, in the lapse of time,” the fund should accumulate beyond the demand for loans, then any surplus was to be devoted to a specified charity. It is quite clear that the secondary dependent trust was void, though a charity, because it might not become vested within the time allowed for the vesting of executory devises. And the primary trust was void because it was not a charity, and was not for the benefit of any particular persons or definite class of persons, and in fact conferred no benefit or charity at all, in any legal or equitable sense, seeing that all who were to accept its offers were to pay the usual price. It was, therefore, a mere trust for accumulation, without any ulterior object in view, except a very remote and accidental one. It would lead to incalculable absurdities to support such a trust. It was not of such a character as to have any claims upon equity for its protection and support.</p>

The very purpose of the bill in equity in that case was to have the trusts declared void, and the trust property transferred and conveyed to the heirs, and it was decided that the trusts were valid, and therefore the relief prayed for was refused.</p>

That court, in the exercise of this equity remedy, has decided that the trusts are valid, and that therefore the heirs are not entitled to a reconveyance, and that is properly the end of the controversy.</p>

A decree is not the less conclusive because an argument, afterwards thought to be important, was not, in proper time, urged upon the consideration of the court.
