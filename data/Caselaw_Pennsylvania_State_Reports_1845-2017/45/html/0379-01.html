But the question to whom these sums belonged, was expressly and purposely left open by this court; and so the Supreme Court understood the proceeding, and therefore remanded the case.

If the order in which the clauses stand were material in fixing the meaning, the item for the payment of debts might be deemed of primary consequence, as standing <em>first </em>among its provisions, but we cannot perceive that such was* his chief solicitude. Why should it have been, when his estate was so large, and his debts were comparatively inconsiderable ? The ruling idea in framing his last will and testament, was probably to give to each child and grandchild, just as much of his estate as he thought each ought to have, lie had three plantations, and other real estate consisting of several tracts of land and a mill, besides some personal property. These plantations he devises in fee ; one to his grandson Jacob Eby, another to his son Christian Eby, and the third to his son Isaac Eby. Each of these devisees is charged with considerable sums, to be paid by him. He gives to his grandson Jacob the plantation in Leacock township, containing one hundred and sixty-nine acres, he paying to the widow, his mother, $26 annually, besides granting her certain privileges and advantages set forth. He-was also to pay $800 to his brother, $500 to each of his two sisters, and the further sum of $200 to his brother Isaac Eby’s children. So he bequeaths to John Eby all his land in Earl township, adjoining lands, &amp;c., by his paying out the following sums of money, viz., to Isaac and Joseph Rutter each $100.

That portion of his real estate, thus set apart as a fund for the special purpose mentioned, was sold by him in his lifetime, before his last will and testament took effect, and the proceeds of course were converted into personal estate, and were personalty at the time of his decease. As such they were applicable not only by his directions, but by force of law, to the payment of his debts; they were personal assets in the hands of his executors, so that when Christian Eby received his letters testamentary, and was charged with the execution of this will, he was entitled to receive, and did receive, $4600.13 of personal assets, applicable to the payment of the debts of his testator.

Christian Eby, as executor, could not demand from Isaac Eby the six hundred dollars charged on his plantation for the use of the testator’s creditors, when there were no such creditors — and for the same reason he was not. obliged to raise the sum charged on his own plantation. Even if he had not so applied the personal assets in his hands, and had called on Isaac Eby to pay the six hundred dollars charged on the plantation devised to him, — the creditors still unpaid, could he legally and equitably have demanded and enforced payment of that sum ? The rule seems to be established that the personal estate is first liable to be applied to the payment of debts, not only in intes<a id="p384" href="#p384" data-label="384" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*384</a>tate estates, but even in estates devised for that purpose, where the devisor or testator leaves personal property, unless the latter is specially or clearly excepted. ‘ Does there appear (said Lord Eldon) from the whole testamentary disposition taken together an intention on the part of the testator so expressed as to convince a judicial mind that it was meant not merely to charge the real estate, <em>but so to charge it as to exempt the personal ?’ </em>&amp;c. In the case of Walker’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Rawle%20229" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Rawle 229">8 Rawle 229</a>, Judge Rogers said, ‘ The personal fund is the first in order for the payment of debts, whether mentioned in the will or not, and this is not doubted as between the devisee of the real estate and the legatee, and how it can make any difference as regards the heirs of the descended lands I am at a loss to discover.’ P. 241. What Christian Eby could not require to be paid by Isaac Eby on account of the charge on the land devised to him, for the use in the said devise mentioned, he would not be obliged himself to pay on account of the charge on the plantation devised to himself for the same use.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b384-7" data-blocks='[["BL_384.4",384,[276,1158,1166,376]]]'>“The conclusion would then appear to follow, legally, that the personal fund provided by the testator being amply sufficient to satisfy all his debts, and not only being properly by law liable to those d.ebts, but actually applied by the executor to discharge the same, there was nothing for the sums charged to be applied to, and the devises were discharged therefrom — so much so, in effect, as if they had been paid by the devisees and applied to the debts of the testator, as he expressed it, ‘for the use of his creditors.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b384-8" data-blocks='[["BL_384.5",384,[276,1543,1166,818]]]'>“ To corroborate this conclusion, the fact is to be considered that there are no residuary legatees in this will, and that to hold these sums charged on the plantations devised to Isaac Eby and Christian Eby to be payable by them for distribution among the heirs of the testator, would be to determine without necessity or reason, that the testator died intestate in regard to these sums of six hundred and one thousand dollars. But such a position, in a case in which it clearly appears that the testator intended, and did in truth dispose of his whole estate — making no provision for any contemplated residuum — would be untenable. Nor does it affect this view of the will that he directs, in the case of the application of the proceeds of the sale of his mill and woodland, that any surplus beyond what might be necessary to pay his debts should be equally divided among his legatees; first, because this provision of the will relates specifically to the fund to be raised by the mill and woodland, which the testator directs his executors to sell in one or two years after his decease; and, secondly, because the provision was rendered null and ineffectual by the testator’s sale of this property in his lifetime.</p>

In the former case, the devise is construed to be <em>a mere trust </em>to pay the debts or other charges, giving no beneficial interest to the devisee, but holding him, after the debts or charges are paid, a mere trustee for the heir as to the residue. In the latter case, the devise is construed to convey the whole beneficial interest to the devisee, subject only to the payment of the debts or other charges. The distinction may seem nice, but it is clearly established as a matter of intention : 2 Story’s Eq. Jur. § 1245. Lord Eldon, in King <em>v. </em>Deni-son, 1 Vesey &amp; Beames 272, states and illustrates the distinction thus: ‘ If I give A. and his heirs all my real estate, charged with my debts, that is a devise to him for a particular purpose, but not for that purpose only. If the devise is upon trust to pay my debts, that is a devise for a particular purpose, and nothing more; and the effect of those two modes admits just this difference. The former is a devise of an estate of inheritance, for the purpose of giving the devisee the beneficial interest, subject to a particular purpose; the latter is a devise for a particular purpose, with no intention to give him any beneficial interest. Where, therefore, the whole legal interest is given for the purpose of satisfying trusts expressed, and those trusts do not in their execution exhaust the whole, so much of the beneficial interest as is not exhausted belongs to the heir. But where the whole interest is given for a particular purpose, with an intention to give to the devisee of the legal estate the beneficial interest, if the <em>whole </em>is not <em>exhausted </em>by that <em>'particular purpose, </em>the <em>surplus goes to the devisee, </em>as it is intended to be given to him.’</p>

The application for the citation to compel the executor to file a sup-, plementary account was but a bill of review in disguise, and should be barred by the Act of 13th October 1840, which limits the right to it, on sufficient cause shown, to five years. But as this position had not much prominence in argument, and was not necessary to the decision of the question involved, the case was in consultation put upon the want of merits in the appellants, without a particular reference to this point.
