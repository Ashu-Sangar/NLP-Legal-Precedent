The purchase being really a partnership transaction, the liability to pay the purchase-money was a partnership liability. If the purchase had proved a profitable one, the firm would have had the advantage of it, and if it has proved a losing operation, the partnership must equally bear the loss, that the purchase was made by Stevens as trustee, and although he did not then disclose his character, yet if the <em>cestui que trusts </em>(White, Stevens &amp; Co.) adopted the act, and claimed the benefit of it, they are clearly liable to pay the purchase-money. That this being, as to Stevens, clearly a partnership debt, and as both the parties are insolvent, the creditor is entitled to all the equities of the trustee, in the distribution of the partnership estate. That if the purchase is as represented by the creditors of the firm, then it followed that the $7000, realized by the sale of the Searle tract, and now for distribution, was the separate property of James Stevens, and as his separate creditor, they were entitled to the whole amount thereof.</p>

That the transaction, so far as the company is concerned, was between them and Mr. Stevens alone. The deed was made to him individually, and the bonds and mortgages were executed by him individually. That no legal liability, on the part of the firm, existed upon the face of the papers, and that to make the partnership liable either in law or equity, it should clearly appear that the transaction was ratified by the firm with the company, or that they assumed the debt to the company by positive agreement with the latter. A mere declaration as between, the members of the firm themselves, that the purchase by one member was on account of the partnership, and an agreement by the firm to assume the payment of the debt contracted by one member, whilst good as between themselves, did not, in law or equity, constitute a claim which could be maintained against the firm by the coal company.</p>

The declaration of trust made it partnership property, -and it must be distributed as such. It might constitute a valid claim on the part of James Stevens for contribution by Henry White, in case <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>he is forced to pay the whole amount, but the partnership character once impressed, it was precisely as though any species of property or capital were contributed by one partner to the common stock of the partnership, and such a contribution would not render the partnership liable for the payment of the amount due by the individual partner for the article purchased, or the money borrowed on his individual credit and made part of the partnership capital, unless a positive assumption of indebtedness is shown on the part of the firm.
