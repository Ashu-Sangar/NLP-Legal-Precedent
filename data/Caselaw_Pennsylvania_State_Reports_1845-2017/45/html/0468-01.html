This was not sufficient to cover the whole ground. The article should have been produced to speak for itself, or its loss accounted for before its contents could be received. There was no attempt to show its actual existence and loss, and without this, there was no evidence on which a recovery could legally be had. The plaintiff’s admission was evidence on the point of the existence of the article as a valid instrument, but this was not enough; its loss and the legal reason for its non-production was wanting. Without this, the presumption would be that no such instrument existed, and what then ? If a recovery be had in this category, it would be on the foot of a mere admission, in writing, it is true, but not in such a shape as to take the case out of the Statute of Frauds and Perjuries, and having no greater force than any other admission made to a stranger. The court passed all these requirements at a bound, and gave the jury unrestrained license to find for the plaintiff, on the admission or recital in the deed that an article of agreement had existed, without further inquiry into its loss or contents. This was wrong. So too was the instruction in regard to the testimony about the unexecuted articles entirely inadequate. It is almost impossible to doubt but that the articles alluded to were of the date of April 15th 1850. The testimony of one of the intended parties proves this clearly. This view of the case should have been referred to the jury, with proper instructions on the effect it would have in explaining the recital in the deed. If the articles of that date were in fact those intended by the recital, that would leave the case without any question as to there being no contract in writing for the land. The recital that the plaintiff had <em>conveyed, </em>the lands by <em>articles of agreement </em>did not mean that a deed had been made to the sons for it, for the very reason given in the same recital for making the deed to Mrs. Wilson, was that the sons had not the legal title; in other words, had no deed. The recital meant no more than what it awkwardly expressed, that articles of agreement had existed for it.</p>
