He entered under John Merwine, and relies upon his title to justify the entry. The case must turn upon the question of title to the land, because, if Merwine had the title, his <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>license to the plaintiff was sufficient for him; if he had not, then the plaintiff was a mere trespasser without colour of title.] He was notified of the adverse claim. Hufsmith warned him not to go on the land. Had Merwine title to that piece of land ? An assessment of taxes for the year 1838 and 1839 has been shown for one hundred and ninety-nine acres and one hundred and forty perches of the William Ross tract, followed by a sale for said taxes in Jung 1840 to John Merwine, and a deed in accordance with said sale. This conveyed to Merwine the title to that tract of land, if it was, during either of those years, the proper subject of a sale for taxes. This depends upon whether it was seated or unseated. Three tracts of land in Chestnut Hill township were surveyed by warrants from the Commonwealth in 1803, and duly patented to George Levers. The patentee, in 1814, conveyed to George Sieglin, John Sieglin, and Frederick Sieglin, as tenants in common, by deed, six hundred and ten acres and one hundred and thirty-nine perches, out of the William Eoss, Mary Carr, and John Wilson tracts. The Sieglins entered into the immediate possession of the land so purchased. They made an improvement by clearing about fifty acres of land, building a house, &amp;c., and occupied it by a resident settlement of the land. In 1815, the Sieglins sold off to Jesse Sieglin ninety-four acres of the land, who made an improvement, and has since resided upon it. George Sieglin, by some amicable partition, had a portion of the tract set off to himself, and had it improved in 1838 and 1839. Frederick Sieglin, Jr., purchased one hundred and ten acres of the tract, and had it improved in 1838 and 1839, making at least four distinct improvements on the six hundred and ten acres during those years. This left a balance of two hundred and ninety-one acres of the original purchase, including the house and improvements first made by John Sieglin, or John and Frederick. They had resided in the house, and occupied the farm and. a saw-mill upon it from 1814, up to about the year 1839. There is some evidence that John Sieglin had sold out his interest in the land to Frederick Sieglin previous to that date. In 1839 Frederick had the exclusive possession. On the 4th day of July 1838, Frederick Sieglin made a voluntary assignment to Charles Haney for the benefit of his creditors, of the land, with all of his other property. On the 27th of November 1839, John Sieglin and his wife joined in a deed for their interest in the land to Charles Haney, as the assignee of Frederick Sieglin, for a nominal consideration, and doubtless in pursuance of the alleged previous contract between the parties. If it was only a consummation of a former agreement for its conveyance, then the effect of it was to vest the whole title in Frederick Sieglin. This left the two hundred and ninety-one acres in 1839 in the possession of and belonging to Frederick Sieglin. <a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>Whether it was returned for the purposes of taxation, all as seated or part as seated and part unseated, from 1814 up to 1886, .we are not informed. In 1836, 1837, 1838, and 1839, it is shown that Frederick Sieglin was assessed with one hundred and seventy-four acres of seated land. The question of the abandonment of a portion of a tract, after a portion of it is seated, or after it has been once treated as seated land, is a question of fact for the jury. Occupation of land without cultivation, and cultivation without occupation, gives it the character of seated land. The remaining two hundred and ninety-one acres embraced a part of the Mary Carr and a part of the William Ross. Perhaps from ninety to one hundred acres of the latter. The original line between the tracts was upon the ground, but there is no evidence of the line ever having been run from the time the warrants were laid. A portion of the ‘ William Ross’ lies outside of the Sieg-lin purchase, but is not claimed in this suit, and therefore has nothing to do with it. That portion of the William Ross, inside of the lines of the six hundred and ten acres, is claimed under the treasurer’s deed. Was it <em>seated </em>or <em>unseated, </em>from 1836 to 1839, inclusive? It was part of the two hundred and ninety-one acres; it was claimed by the occupant; it was used as woodland attached to a farm is usually occupied. It was included within the lines of the farm. [Is there any evidence to show that the Sieglins ever abandoned it to the unseated list; that they ever authorized it to be so assessed for taxes ? The mere fact of Frederick Sieglin being assessed for only one hundred and seventy-four acres in the seated list is not sufficient; that may have been the mistake of the assessor. If shown to be the act of Sieglin it would be different.] Besides, there is no evidence as to what constituted the one hundred and seventy-four acres. It might as well have embraced the part of the ‘ Ross’ survey as to be all of the ‘Mary Carr.’ If Sieglin had run off one hundred and seventy-four acres, marked his boundaries, and returned only the number of acres included within them for taxation in the seated list, it would have afforded strong evidence of the abandonment of the residue to the unseated list. [As it is, we are bound to instruct the jury that the whole two hundred and ninety-one acres were seated during the years for which they were assessed, and that the 'sale to Merwine conferred no title whatever.] If the tax sale was void, has any other title been shown in Merwine on which the plaintiff can rely ? He claims the title of John Sieglin to an undivided half part of the whole two hundred and ninety-onq acres, under a deed from the widow and heirs of John Sieglin, dated 13th February 1849. John Sieglin and wife had conveyed all of the interest they had to Charles H. Haney, assignee of Frederick Sieglin, Cn the 27th of November 1839. True, the deed was not recorded, but John <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>Merwine bad it in bis possession from 1846 to 1847, perhaps a whole year. He had been the clerk for the assignee of Sieglin. He obtained the deed from Walton upon his own application. Pie had at the time a treasurer’s deed for a portion of the land. He was so far interested as to put him upon his inquiry in reference to the title. He had the motive for strengthening, if possible, the title he then had. Indeed, for aught we know, he had that very deed in his possession from 1846 until he delivered it to the other party on the trial of this cause. Piad he notice of the conveyance previously made by John Sieglin and wife ? Certainly he had notice, in fact, and in the very strongest form. He had the record in his pocket. He is therefore not an innocent purchaser without notice, and can take nothing by his deed.</p>

If he had undertaken to convey in the character of assignee, then he had nothing to convey. The interest of Frederick Sieglin had been sold at sheriff’s sale on a judgment, the lien of which attached in 1837, two years before the deed of assignment. Could he convey away the moiety of John Sieglin ? Certainly not. It was conveyed to him as assignee. It was really conveyed to Frederick Sieglin. It vested the whole title in him. The sheriff’s vendee took the whole interest of Frederick in the land sold. He took his right of possession as well as his title. The possession surrendered by John to Frederick passed to Hufsmith, the sheriff’s vendee. John Sieglin had no right to re-enter as against Frederick, and his widow and heirs had no greater right. He could not, if living, take the possession against Hufsmith, and Charles Haney could not convey that right to Merwine.

The theory for this was, that as the occupant of it had been assessed with only one hundred and seventy-four acres instead of two hundred and ninety-one, the balance was abandoned, and was properly placed on the unseated list and sold for taxes. It is supposed that this theory was strengthened by the fact that an old warrant line severed this portion of the tract from the farm to which it belonged. This is not so. Warrant lines were made for the grantees of the state, but they bind not purchasers from the warrantees. A farm may be and often is composed of parts of several adjacent tracts, and it is no more necessary that its occupant should actually cultivate each fraction than that he should cultivate the whole, where it had always been a unit, to render it seated. The only question to be determined is, whether it is part of the occupied tract, and used as woodland belonging to it. If so, it is seated and cannot be sold. This was in substance what the court told the jury, and left for their decision. So too did the court leave it as a question for the jury whether in fact the portion of ninety-eight acres sold for taxes had been severed and set apart from the cultivated portion of the tract, with a view to be abandoned and assessed as unseated. On both these questions the jury found against the plaintiff, and thus demolished that branch of title relied on by him. The plaintiff had an advantage in this treatment of the evidence, which I doubt if lie was entitled to; for I see no sufficient evidence to have required the question to be submitted to the jury. The mistakes of assessors never alter the rights of parties. Something more must be shown. The assent of the owner of land that is to be assessed and treated as unseated, may make a different case when a sale of it as such ensues. In such a case he may be estopped from denying a character given to it by himself. That is not this case. The only evidence on which to raise the question, was the old warrant line submerged in the farm, and the act of the assessor in returning it unseated. The court might well have said that neither of these nor both together, in view of <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>the well-known usages of the country, were sufficient evidence of abandonment against the fact of its use as part of a larger tract which was seated.</p>

That is true. To this the defendant pleaded not guilty, and <em>liberum tenementum, </em>but withdrew the latter plea after exhibiting his title, but did not withdraw his evidence, and the court refused to rule it out.

Upon the same reason, when timber is cut by a trespasser, why shall not the owner claim it as part of his freehold ? It stands upon the same reason, and must be judged of by the same rule. The owner did not assent to its severance, and while it remains on the premises he may claim it as part of his freehold: Harlan <em>v. </em>Harlan, 3 Harris 507. In such an aspect, therefore, it was proper to show title. It would not merely justify a taking, but it authorized it. I cannot, therefore, see any error in refusing to rule out the defendant’s title.</p>

These instructions were as favourable as the plaintiff was entitled to. They placed his case on the only ground that remained. The jury found this point also against him, and manifestly rightly so found it, if we regard the testimony in the cas'.</p>
