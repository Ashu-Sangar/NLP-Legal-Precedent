    <p class="summary" id="b89-11" data-blocks='[["BL_89.9",89,[121,996,1165,557]]]'>This was an ejectment by Francis J. Parvin against Benjamin Capewell, for a bouse and three lots in St. Clair, Schuylkill county. The plaintiff claimed title by virtue of a deed from the sheriff to him as the property of the defendant. The defendant alleged that the title to the property was in his wife, Joanna Cape-well, and that the property belonged to her. Three several deeds were read from J. and S. Bennison and wives to Joanna Cape-well, for the three lots in question, but the plaintiff alleged that the purchase-money paid to the grantors for the lots, was the money of the defendant, and that the deeds for the lots were executed to the wife, and the title vested in her to hinder, delay, and defeat the creditors of the defendant in the collection of their debts, and this was the question to be decided.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b89-12" data-blocks='[["BL_89.10",89,[124,1554,1165,771]]]'>On the trial, after the plaintiff had shown title as vendee of the sheriff, the defendant proved that he was a miner; that he came to this country from England with his wife in 1833; that he and his wife visited England in 1837, and on their return to this country in the same year, they were accompanied by Mrs. Capewell’s sister, who testified that on the passage from England she saw in Mrs. Capewell’s possession, some money in American gold, American bank notes and silver, and there might have been some sovereigns among it; that Mrs. Capewell lent her some money on the passag-e to buy provisions; that afterwards, in 1841, when the defendant was away at work, Mrs. Capewell lived with her, and then showed her some money; Mrs. Capewell said it was a thousand dollars; .it was in gold and silver; Mrs. Capewell said the defendant had given it to her; Mrs. Capewell kept the money in a bag. This witness also proved that it was the common practice for English miners to give their earnings to their wives to keep for them; that the deféndant was an honest, industrious working miner.</p>

The defendant also proved that in the year 1846, Mrs. Capewell left a bag of money (contents not known) with a neighbour when she and her husband locked up their house, and went to some distance on a visit. The man with whom she left the bag of money was an English miner, who handed it to his wife for safe-keeping. And on Mrs. Capewell-’s return, after a few days’ absence, the bag was returned as it had been received. He also proved that about twelve years before the trial, Mrs. Capewell was seen coming out of the Miners’ Bank with some silver and gold, which was tied up in her apron, and which she took to a store in Pottsville. That in the year 1846 he commenced mining on his own account, in company with Samuel Capewell, John Dovey, and John Ray, under the firm name of Capewell &amp; Co., each one advancing about five hundred dollars as his share of the capital, and each working in the mines. In the year 1847, the firm made money. John Ray left the firm in 1847, and Francis J. Parvin came into it. The firm name was then changed to Parvin, Dovey &amp; Co. In the year 1849, the firm purchased of Andrew Russell the St. Clair Colliery for $14,000, and on January 2d 1850, the firm of Parvin, Dovey <em>k </em>Co. was dissolved, and the property of the firm was divided, Parvin taking the St. Clair Colliery, and the defendant and Samuel Capewell and John Dovey, under the firm of Oapewells &amp; Dovey, taking the Ravensdale Colliery. The liabilities of the firm were also divided as between themselves, Francis J. Parvin assuming the liabilities of the St. Clair Colliery, and Oapewells &amp; Dovey assuming the liabilities of the colliery at Ravensdale. He also proved that some time in May or June 1849, Mrs. Capewell offered to lend to one of the miners at the colliery some money to send for his wife from England, saying that she had a few hundred dollars that did not belong/to the company. That “the firm began to go backward in 1850,” yet they considered themselves in good circumstances, their liabilities, on December 13th 1850, being $3232.15, and their bills receivable $1018.09. They had no real estate, and no property excepting the colliery. He also proved that in the month of December 1850, John Dovey proposed to sell out his interest in the firm .to Benjamin Capewell for $3500, of which $1000 was to be paid in cash, and the balance secured to be paid in a satisfactory manner.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b90-6" data-blocks='[["BL_90.4",90,[287,2109,1169,301]]]'>The defendant then proposed to prove by John Dovey, that during the negotiations which resulted in the withdrawal of Benjamin Capewell from the firm of Oapewells &amp; Dovey, on the 13th December 1850, witness proposed to Benjamin Capewell to sell to him his interest in the colliery, and that Benjamin said that his wife, Mrs. Joanna Capewell, was able to furnish $1500 ■ for that purpose, if she would agree to do so.</p>

The witness then stated “ the proposition was for the defendant to take nay interest in the colliery. The defendant and Mrs. Capewell, Samuel Capewell and I, met in Pottsvillo. Ben (the defendant) said his wife was here with the money if I wished to take it, and in fact, she produced the money, but the amount I did not know. She had it tied in a handkerchief.” The payment was to be $1500. The parties could not agree' upon the security for the last payment, and the transaction was finally closed the same day by the defendant selling his interest in the firm to John Dovey and Samuel Capewell for $1000. The money was paid to the defendant. The rent for which the judgment of McCartee and others was obtained, accrued after the defendant had left the firm. This witness also stated that he <em>“ </em>heard the defendant say he could borrow money from his wife, could get money from his wife. When he first went into business he did not pretend to have any money that he did not get from his wife, and that was the capital he went into business with.”</p>

A post-nuptial settlement of property upon a wife is a transaction which admits of other evidence than the declaration of th.e husband after he has fallen into embarrassments. But of such settlement there was no proof in this case. A mere <em>gift </em>of money to a wife is not a settlement of it as her separate estate, for it may be for safe-keeping and deposit, without any intention to divest the husband’s title. And her possession of funds ordinarily implies no more than that she is holding them for her husband. If they are funds that have accrued to her from separate estate, or by gift or bequest from some one else than her husband, or by settlement of her husband, let it be shown. Let it be shown by competent evidence that she had an estate to yield the fund, or that an act of gift or bequest was performed in her behalf, or that a settlement was made. Such facts and transactions admit of proof, if ever they had an honest existence, and when proved, they account for the wife’s possession of moneys ; but when they are not proved, they are not to be implied from her mere possession.</p>
