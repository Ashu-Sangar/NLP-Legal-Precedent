There had been an old bridge at this place prior to 1831, in which year the abutments of the present bridge were built. Previous to 1831, there was an ancient fording across the creek just below the division line. Immediately below the ford, in the creek, was a row of stones, which had been thrown out of the track to make the fording more easy, raised and tightened by the accretions of the stream from year to year. In, 1843 Brown built a dam across this creek, about 100 feet below the division line. In the summer of 1859 he took out this dam and put in another, which he closed on the 5th of November of that year.

The date of Bush’s title is not furnished us, but of course it was subsequent to the immemorial stone row. He acquired title, then, to land that was subject to whatever back-flow or obstruction of water the stone row occasioned. The stone row was part of the bed of the creek, and as it was below his line, Bush could not enter to remove or alter it, and must enjoy his land as he took it, subject to have just so much of it overflowed as the stone row, and other natural peculiarities of the creek below his lines, caused to be overflowed.</p>

No evidence was rejected when offered, and none was excluded from the consideration of the jury, but they were told to apply it only to the period designated. This was beneficial to the defendant.

Whether a “ construction” or a natural deposit, it had existed long enough to entitle it to exist till the owner chose to remove it. The defendant claimed no benefit from it further than it worked a change in the bed of the stream, and this the learned judge conceded to him. Besides, he immediately followed this by saying, “ but conceding that the fording did form a dam, and raise the water, has or has not the defendant’s dam raised the water on the plaintiff’s land, even above what is claimed for that stone row?” This was pointing the jury to the real question in the <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>case, so that the exceptionable observation with which the interrogatory was introduced is not worth reversing for. To give the defendant the right to impede and raise the water, as much by his dam as it was impeded and raised by the stone row, was to give him all that was due to him, and this he got from the judge. Whatever was erroneously said could not have affected the damages, injuriously to the defendant, for they were only fifty cents.</p>

And his counsel argue that results so obtained are mathematical demonstrations which cannot be gainsaid. But there was evidence of what the court calls “ actual visible facts,” to which they led the jury to give preference over the instrumental measurements, and this is the error complained of. These facts were, the ripples above and below the stone row, and above the bridge, the mud-sill under the bridge frequently out of water before the dam was built, but not visible when the dam was full — the rise and fall of the water on the posts and abutments of the bridge, and the drowning out of the spring-i'un, about thirty yards above the bridge. Witnesses referred themselves to one or more of these circumstances, to establish their opinions that the dam of the defendant had raised the water higher on plaintiff’s land than the stone row raised it. As there was a struck jury and view in the case, these and similar tests, on the ground, became important evidence; and when we consider how liable instrumental measurements are to accidents and mistakes, we think the court gave no undue prominence to the “ actual and visible facts” alluded to. The learned judge said, with great propriety, “ water will find its level with more certainty than science can do the same work. The instrumental levelling does show that Mr. Brown has more fall upon his land than he has elevation at his dam; but if that does not tell the height of the water set back as clearly as shown by the water itself, then the fact demonstrated upon the ground must govern.”</p>

Who can calculate for what the watermen call “ piling” of water; or for the effect of removing a given obstruction a few rods further down stream, whereby the <em>veloeity </em>of the current at a particular point is changed ; or for atmospheric resistance to water ? The question of fact in this case was a very close one.
