On the 27th of January 1860, Elstner shipped to Steman, Baker &amp; Co. a consignment of two hundred barrels of flour, and advised them that he had drawn upon them for $1000.

A party presents a check upon a bank ; by reason of a wrong date or some informality, as in the present case, the bank officer refuses payment, but tells the holder to return it and obtain a new one,' and he will pay it. In the interval, other checks of the drawer are presented and paid, and when the holder of the informal check, who now has another in lieu of it, arrives, he is told that the drawer’s account is exhausted, and there are no funds in bank to meet it; will it be seriously contended that the bank is liable upon the promise thus made ? This is the exact case here presented. The drawer of the draft failed before the presentation of the second draft, and the defendants, in the same manner, having no funds, refused to accept. Nor was the promise to accept the new bill made to the plaintiffs, between whom and the defendants there is no privity of contract, but the letter was written to Elstner.</p>

Though not addressed to them, that letter was shown to them, as was proved by William Stewart, and they were thus expressly informed by the defendants that the first draft had been declined merely for an “ informality in drawing,” and that if a correct one were sent they would accept it. When a corrected draft was sent, in pursuance of this proposition, they were bound to accept it. The authorities cited show the rule of law to be, that a promise to accept a bill for a <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>fixed amount is equivalent to an acceptance not only as to the drawer, but as to every party who takes the bill on the faith of that promise. The prevailing inducement for considering a promise to accept, as an acceptance, is that credit is thereby given to the bill. And this credit is given as effectually by a letter written before the date of the bill, as by one written after-wards. Hence Chief Justice Marshall stated the result of the authorities to be, that a letter written within a reasonable time before or after the date of a bill of exchange, describing it in terms not to be mistaken, and promising to accept it, is, if shown to the person who afterwards takes the bill on the credit of the letter, a virtual acceptance binding the person who makes the promise: Coolidge <em>v. </em>Payson, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wheat.%2075" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="2 Wheat. 75">2 Wheat. 75</a>.
