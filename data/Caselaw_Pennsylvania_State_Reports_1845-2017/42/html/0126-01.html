The language of the court was so general in meaning and so technical in expression as to mislead a jury, and that they were so misled, is the only method of accounting for the verdict in opposition to the very full and uncontradicted testimony of settlement, of plaintiff’s agreement to surrender the judgment, and of his declarations that he had no claim upon it. A party is entitled to a charge as to the legal result of his evidence, if believed by the jury: Clark <em>v. </em>Fabor, 2 Wms. (28 Verm.) 222. No notice was taken of the third point, and points not answered may be considered as negatived by the court: Arbuckle <em>v. </em>Thompson, <a href="/wright/1/0172-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Wright 170" data-case-ids="626012" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0172-01">1 Wright 170</a>. A negative answer to this point would manifestly have been error. The fourth point should have been affirmed, for the law will not allow a party to take advantage of his own wrong, and if the plaintiff wilfully duped the defendant into the belief that possession of the prothonotary’s certificate would enable him to cancel the judgment, and thereby procured from him the note for $758.28, this was an equitable defence to the judgment, and plaintiff ought not to have been allowed to recover. This point had reference solely to the first settlement between plaintiff and defendant. The fifth point had reference solely to the second, which took place twenty days afterwards, yet the court answered them together, flatly negativing both.' Defendant was entitled to clear, distinct, and specific answers to all the points, but they are nowhere to be found in the charge of the court: Penna. Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Zebe, 33 Penna. St. Rep. 318 ; Bellas <em>v. </em>Hayes, 5 S. &amp; R. 427; Shaffer <em>v. </em>Landis, 1 Id. 449; Hamilton <em>v. </em>Minor, 2 Id. 70; Brown <em>v. </em>Campbell, 1 Id. 176; Vincent <em>v. </em>Huff, 4 Id. 298; Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Holly, 14 Grratt. (Va.) 447, 478. The fifth and sixth points, negatived by the court, related to the construction of the agreement in writing of May 24th. This and the other agreement of same date were simultaneously executed as part of a common transaction, and should therefore be construed as one agreement. They were evidently made to close the dispute as to the former settlement, and to relieve the defendant of the judgment, and will admit of no construction but that suggested by the points of defendants. The releasing clause is an independent part of the agreement, to take effect at a time fixed, upon a fixed contingency, without reference to the <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>completion of the work, to wit, upon the giving of the security: Drake <em>v. </em>Garce, <a href="/ala/22/0409-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="22 Ala. 409" data-case-ids="8495908" data-case-paths="/ala/22/0409-01">22 Ala. 409</a>. The words “upon receiving security,” fix the time beyond all question. In case of ambiguity the court will search for the true meaning, but will not adopt a construction in violation of the letter: Lemon <em>v. </em>Elanakan, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Hempst.%2032" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Hempst. 32">1 Hemp. 32</a>; Loughor Coal Company <em>v. </em>Williams, 28 Eng. Law &amp; Eq. 496. In this case both the extrinsic circumstances and the terms of the contract point clearly to the construction contended for by the defendant.</p>

The learned judge did affirm the first and second points; he merely used the words “payment” and “satisfaction” in place of the word “cancel,” as requested. There was no error in that. The question before the jury, on that part of the case, was, whether the note had been accepted in payment and satisfaction of this judgment, and they found that it had not been so accepted. It would have been hard for them to have found otherwise, as the plaintiff in error contended before them that the first agreement of 24th May was intended to satisfy or cancel it.</p>

The testimony did not warrant it. He had confessed a judgment for $1500, and the fixing of the amount of his indebtedness thereon at little more than half that sum, was a benefit to him and not a'fraud. He has not brought himself within the principle of the authorities cited in support of this specification.</p>

As to the fifth and sixth specifications, it is submitted that no error was committed by the court in declining to affirm these points. The only defence to this judgment was, either payment or proof of that which, in equity, was equivalent thereto. Payment was not pretended, and it is submitted that plaintiff in error failed to prove anything which, in equity or morals, entitled him to relief. He proved the execution merely of an agreement which, as he asserts, was intended to settle the disputes between himself and the defendent in error, but he failed to prove his performance of that agreement.</p>

It was therefore his testimony that brought the jury to find that the settlement between the parties and note of the 4th of May 1860, was but the liquidation of the cautionary judgment given by the defendant to the plaintiff. Whether the note was accepted in satisfaction of the judgment, as the defendant below contended, or a liquidation of the amount due on it, as contended for by the plaintiff, was raised by the testimony, and was properly referred to the jury. There is therefore no error in the first three assignments of error.</p>

That was a contract between the parties for the erection of a three-story brick house by the defendant for the plaintiff, within three months from the date of the contract, for which the plaintiff was to pay $1000, and in addition thereto to satisfy and discharge all claims and demands which he held against the defendant, <em>“ </em>upon receiving security to perform the several agreements <em>therein </em>named.” The defendant gave the security, but never performed any of the covenants, and now seeks to throw the responsibility of nonperformance on the personal covenant of himself and surety. He claims that the agreement satisfies the judgment. We do not think so. The covenants between the parties constitute an entire and indivisible contract, with mutual and dependent conditions. The defendant could only claim a satisfaction of the judgment by performance. This he does not pretend. How, therefore, can he claim to enforce a contract which is executory, requiring the action of the court to enforce it, without a compliance with his own covenants, which he must make conditions precedent to the" enforcement of the covenants on the other side ? In other words, what right has he to claim payment for building the house, which he has never touched, when he can only claim the benefits of the stipulated compensation after the work is done ? There would be no equity in an adjudication which would satisfy the judgment, and turn the plaintiff round to the covenants of the defendant and his surety, to recover the money back again; and it would be downright wrong to the surety. We will not further elaborate this view, and, as we see nothing wrong in' the remaining error, the judgment is</p>
