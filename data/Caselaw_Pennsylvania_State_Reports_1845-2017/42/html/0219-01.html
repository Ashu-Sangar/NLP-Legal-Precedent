The complainants’ bill averred, That they are citizens of the state of Pennsylvania, and owners in whole or in part of five steamboats, viz. : the “ Hero,” “Champion,” “Alida,” “Alert,” and the “Joseph L. Boss.” That the said steamboats are, and for a long time have been, employed as tow-boats in navigating the river Schuylkill, and that the course of their business has been to receive canal-boats, which have descended the canal of the Schuylkill Navigation Company, at or near Fairmount, and tow the same down the river Schuylkill. That the said business is a valuable one, and important to the trade and commerce of the city of Philadelphia, and mainly consists in towing barges loaded with coal, grain, iron, and lumber. That the said boats tow loaded barges, varying in number from one to twelve, and need a large water-way to enable them to be safely transported, and the business to be conducted. That there is across the river Schuylkill, at Market street, and has been for many years, a bridge (of which a plan was annexed). That the piers of the said bridge are so established, that a clear water-way down the river, of one hundred and ninety-five feet, is left as a free and open channel for the commerce of said river. That the diagram (which was annexed and marked “ A,”) truly exhibits the position and distances between the shore and the piers of the said Market Street Bridge. That the said bridge at Market street, by reason of the width of water-way, furnishes the means of conducting the business of your orators, and of other citizens, by steam-vessels and barges, which do not exceed twenty-four feet in height. That below Market street, and between Market and Chestnut streets, wdrarves have been built on the river Schuylkill, for the accommodation of sailing vessels, to which sailing vessels and steamboats can pass by means of the draw in the bridge at Gray’s Ferry, and a large business in coal, lumber, lime, and the like, is conducted on that part of the said river Schuylkill, and which forms part of the port of Philadelphia. That, under pretence of an Act of Assembly, approved the 27th day of March, a. d. 1852, the city of Philadelphia is, by means of the agency of, or a contract with, the other defendants, about to erect a bridge across the river Schuylkill, at Chestnut street. That the pier for the support of said bridge so about to be erected at said Chestnut street, is placed directly in the centre of the channel of the said river. That the water-way on each side of said pier, as proposed to be erected, is but one hundred and seventy feet, and the said pier intended to be erected as aforesaid, is so placed as to make it most dangerous for barges being towed down the river Schuylkill, and to -render it almost impossible so to change their direction after passing Market street, in the short distance of less than five hundred feet between Market and Chestnut streets, as to prevent a collision at the said <a id="p221" href="#p221" data-label="221" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*221</a>pier. That the water-way at Chestnut street could readily be maintained of the same width as that at Market street, and the highway be comparatively uninterrupted, by placing piers so that the same channel-way may be maintained, or by a suspension bridge. That said exhibit marked “A,” truly exhibits the position of the pier of said bridge so about to be erected at Chestnut street relatively to the piers of said bridge erected at Market street, the channel of the river, and the width of the water-way at said Chestnut street. That the defendants pretend that they do in fact leave the same area of water-way at Chestnut street as is now had at Market street; but the complainants deny the same, or that the construction in that respect put on the Act of Assembly is the lawful one. That they, the complainants, are citizens of the United States, and, as owners of said vessels trading to and from the port of Philadelphia, are entitled to the free navigation of said river, and to have a reasonable and proper width of water-way kept and maintained at the said bridge at Chestnut street. That they are also entitled to have the said bridge so constructed as not unreasonably to impede the navigation of said stream, and especially are they entitled to have the piers so placed as to keep the same free and open, and that the defendants are by law required so to make the same, and to leave a water-way at Chestnut street equal in width to the water-way between the piers at Market street. ’And praying, 1st. That it be decreed that the said bridge cannot be constructed unless the piers are built in the same relative position as those of said Market Street Bridge, or unless a clear navigable water-way of at least one hundred and ninety-five feet is left free and uninterrupted. 2d. An injunction special till hearing, and perpetual thereafter, restraining the defendants from building the said bridge with the pier in the centre of the river, or from building the same in any such way as shall not leave a clear navigable water-way of at least one hundred and ninety-five feet. 3d.

There is no natural right of the citizen, except the personal rights of life and liberty, which is paramount to his fight to navigate freely the navigable streams of the country he inhabits. It ranks immediately after those great personal rights. It is superior even to the right of fishing, which contributes to the food on which the community subsists, for it has been judicially decided that when the rights of navigation conflict with the rights of fishing, the latter must give way to the former: Port <em>v. </em>Mann, 1 Southard’s Rep. 61; Shrunk <em>v. </em>Schuylkill Nav.

      <a id="p229" href="#p229" data-label="229" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*229</a>When the king held, among the royal prerogatives, the dominion over and the right of property in the waters of the sea, and inland waters of the sea, they were, nevertheless, of common right public for every subject to navigate upon, and to fish in, without interruption. These inherent privileges of navigation and fishing were denominated <em>jura </em>publica, or <em>jura communia, </em>in contradistinction from <em>jura coronce. </em>They are said in the old books to exist of “ common right,” which, according to Lord Coke, is only another epithet for common law. A sense of the importance of preserving navigation unobstructed in all navigable rivers, was manifested in England at a very early period, as is indicated by the laws relating to sewers, which are remarkable for antiquity: Collis on Sewers 25. The principle of that clause of Magna Charta to which I took occasion to refer in Ingham’s Case, 12 Casey 201, has been considered as discountenancing all obstructions to navigation, and therefore on an information filed against a defendant for building locks in the Thames, Chief Justice Holt said, that to hinder the course of a navigable river was against Magna Charta: Rex <em>v. </em>Clarke, 12 Mod. Rep. 615. By statute of Edward 3, ch. 4, it was enacted that all mills, weirs, stanks, stakes, and kiddles, which were levied and set in the time of King Edward 1, and after, whereby <em>ships and vessels </em>were disturbed, should be cut and pulled down. The statute 4 Henry 4, ch. 15, after reciting that by weirs, stakes, and kiddles in the water of the Thames, and in other great rivers throughout the realm, the common passage of ships and boats are disturbed, and also the young fry of fish be destroyed, enacts that “ all the former statutes thereof made be held, and kept, and put in execution.” These statutes show the high value which in early times our English ancestry set upon the free and unobstructed passage of navigable rivers, and their long-continued solicitude and determination to preserve it: Angell on Tidewaters 83, 85, and Statutes at Large, vol. 1.</p>

Navigation was, from the first settlement of the province, an inherent and paramount right of the people. But we did not retain the common law definition of navigable streams. At common law, those rivers only are called navigable in which the tide ebbs and flows. All rivers entirely above the influence of the tide, if they are so large as to admit navigation, and to be of public use for the passage of vessels, boats, &amp;c., may be, as well as those which ebb and flow, under the servitude of the public interest, and are used as public highways by water. “ There be some streams or rivers,” says Lord Hale, “that are private not only in property or ownership, but also in use, as little streams and rivers that are not a common passage for the king’s people. Again, there <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>be other rivers, as well fresh as salt, that are of common or public use for the carriage of boats and lighters; and these, whether they are fresh or salt, whether they flow and reflow or not, are <em>primd facie, publici juris, </em>common highways for man, goods, or both, from one inland town or another:” Hargrave’s Tracts, <em>Be Jure Maris, </em>ch. 3. The common law definition of navigable rivers affects, therefore, rather the proprietorship in the soil or bed of the river than the right of navigation.

Whether it may be totally destroyed or not, is not the question in this case; for, at most, it is only proposed to impair, and not to extinguish it. In England, though the Queen, at this day, can do nothing in derogation of the public right of navigation, such public right being paramount to any right of the Crown, yet the omnipotence of parliament is competent even to extinguish the right to navigate a river, or an arm of the sea: Williams <em>v. </em>Wilcox, 8 A. &amp; E. 314; Rex <em>v. </em>Montaigne, 4 B. &amp; C. 598.

In Wilcox <em>v. </em>The Blackbird Creek Marsh Co., <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pet.%20250" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="2 Pet. 250">2 Peters 250</a>, it was held that an Act of Assembly which authorized a dam in a creek where the tide ebbs and flows, was an affair between the government of the state of Delaware and its citizens, of Avhich the Supreme Court of the United States could take no cognisance. “If Congress had passed any act which bore upon the case,” said Marshall, C. J.; “ any act in execution of the power to regulate commerce, we should feel not much difficulty in saying that a state law coming in conflict with such act would be void. But Congress has passed no such act.” Judge Story lays it clown as a principle, that in order to consider a state law as void because conflicting with a statute of the United States, it must not only affect the subject-matter, have some influence over it, but must be directly incompatible or repugnant — an extreme inconvenience to it: 1 Story’s Com. on Con. 432. In the case of The United States <em>v. </em>The New Bedford Bridge, 1 Woodbury &amp; Minot’s Rep. 407, where the late Justice Woodbury discussed all the authorities at great length, he says that where a stream is within the limits of a state in its whole course, he could see no reason, as a general principle, why that state might not obstruct its navigation or suspend it. As a general ¡principle, there doubtless is no reason why the power of the state legislature is not as absolute over such streams as that of Parliament over the streams of Great Britain; but since many of such streams, the Schuylkill inclusive, bear a necessary relation to the commerce of the country, and since the state has not only delegated to Congress the power to regulate commerce, but has agreed also in the Federal Constitution, <em>“ </em>that the citi<a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>zens of each state shall he entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the several states,” it is an inevitable deduction that the legislative power of the state is not competent to destroy the navigability of such a stream as the Schuylkill. And if, from respect to the constitutional rights of citizens of other states, the navigation of the Schuylkill may not be suspended or destroyed by state legislation, then certainly we must imply a limitation of legislative power in behalf of our own citizens, or else we come to the absurd conclusion that the citizens of <em>New </em>York or New Hampshire have more rights in the waters of the Schuylkill than the citizens of Pennsylvania. (Edt though the legislative power be not competent to suspend or dest'r,c&gt;y''havigation, it may. improve, regulate, and control the_-n,avigation, unless it comes into direct conflict "with some constitutional Act of Congress'." ,Tlris~is a power that has been freely exercised by the states ever since the constitution was adopted. A partial diminution of the navigability of the stream by the erection of a bridge, is quite within the competency of the state legislature. Bridges are great public conveniences, monuments of civilization, and means to the highest development of the social life of the community. In all cases the legislature has the power to inquire when the public convenience demands a partial restraint of the freedom of navigation for the sake of a bridge, and to prescribe the terms and conditions on which the bridge shall be built. Where, as in the case of Dugan <em>v. </em>The Monongahela Bridge Co., 3 Casey 303, the legislature have taken the wise precaution of introducing a proviso to save unimpaired the rights of navigation, we held'the company who built the bridge liable to compensate a navigator in damages for his property destroyed against the piers of the bridge, without fault on his part; but where, as in the late case of Clark <em>v. </em>The Birmingham and Pittsburgh Bridge Co., <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20147" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="5 Wright 147">5 Wright 147</a>, a bridge was authorized without any such express proviso, we refused to sustain an action for damages by a party injured by the piers.</p>

Well, suppose it be' so, and that the consequence be a necessary reduction of the length of the tows; is that too great a sacrifice to make for the comfort and convenience which a bridge will furnish to the populous districts on the banks of the Schuylkill? Do the plaintiffs mean that this large city shall suffer perpetually the want of the bridge, lest they be compelled to shorten their tows ? That were unreasonable. Their right of navigation, like all the rights of citizenship, is held subject to the common weal, and of the time and manner of promoting that, the legislature are the judges. They have authorized the city to build the bridge, and if the plaintiffs find their rights impaired thereby — not destroyed, but only impaired — it is one of the sacrifices which must be borne for the sake of the general good, and compensation of which must be looked for in the increase of population, wealth, and business which will result from the erection of the bridge.</p>

How could a bridge be built on piers at Chestnut' street, where the river is only three hundred and sixty-four feet wide, and leave the same width of water-way as at Market street, where the river is four hundred and eighty-six and one-half feet wide ? When it is considered that the legislature were not providing for the navigation by this reference to the “ area,” but only for the relief of the Fairmount Waterworks, by preserving under the Chestnut Street Bridge as much vent for the down-coming water as existed under the Market Street Bridge, Mr. Kneass’s plan of estimating the area seems to be a reasonable construction of the act. He insists <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>that the area is to he got not by linear, but by a square measurement. He is not very full or explicit on the jooint, but as I understand his affidavit, he would multiply the width and the depth of the river to get the area of the passage for water. The product of these lines he considers the square of the volume of water, and he states that it will be, at Chestnut street, after the bridge with one pier shall be constructed, ten thousand three hundred and seventy-one feet, while that existing at Market street is only nine thousand two hundred and six feet, so that, according to Mr. Kneass, notwithstanding the comparative narrowness of the river at Chestnut street, there will be under the new bridge “ a clear and uninterrupted passage for the water of said river,” considerably greater in area than that at Market street. This conclusion of Mr. Kneass is not otherwise questioned by the plaintiffs than as they deny his premises. They will not agree that the area is to be got by squaring the volume of the river, but only by measuring its linear surface.</p>

The affidavits show us that once in the history of the Fairmount Waterworks, the wheels were so drowned by a flood in the Schuylkill, that the city was in great danger of suffering for lack of water, and that the piers of the Market Street Bridge offered a considerable obstacle to the flow of the stream. Any piers at Chestnut street would be an additional obstacle. The legislature meant to guard the city from the disastrous consequences of the loss of water, even for a day, by securing as free a discharge for the current of the river in future as is enjoyed at present. What they said had no reference to the rights of navigation, but only to the outflow of the river. To measure that for mere purposes of discharge, the perpendicular depth must be taken as well as the width. The depth as well as width would contribute to relieve the wheels at Fairmount, and therefore the word area, as used in this Act of Assembly, must be taken to include the depth. Ordinarily <em>the </em>word means any plain suj*face, as the floor of a room, or the enclosed space on which a building stands, or the portion of the site which is not built upon: [Webster and Worcester.] In geometry it denotes the superficial contents of any figure — the surface included within any given lines. In neither of these senses was the word well chosen to express the thought of the legislature; for, according to its etymology, it does undoubtedly imply merely a superficial measurement. It is said to come from the Latin, <em>arere, </em>to dry, and implied originally a place where com, when reaped, was dried and threshed. But construing the word according to the evident intent and purpose of the Act of Assembly in which it <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>is found, we give it the effect above indicated, and hold that the city have provided for a passage of water under their new bridge <em>“equal at least in </em>area” to that now existing under the Market Street Bridge.</p>
    <p id="b235-5" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[139,582,1167,300]]]'>There is nothing else that calls for discussion in this case. We recognise the plaintiffs’ right of navigation, but hold that the legislature were competent to impair it to the extent they have done in the law before us. We hold, also, that the city propose to build in substantial compliance with the terms of legislation, and therefore that they and their contractors are not to be stopped.</p>
