Partly owing to- the great difficulty, in most cases the impossibility, of proving the relationship of past generations, the stringent rule of law is relaxed, and the declaration of those who are likely to know the fact and have no interest to pervert it are received as evidence; and on the part of the plaintiff below, some such evidence was received, and <em>primd facie </em>perhaps it was sufficient.</p>

If such were not the habit of mankind, evidence of family tradition could not he received as tending to establish pedigree. If, therefore, it. bo made to appear that the well-nigh universal habits of men with reference to marriage, do not exist in a certain district of country, and among a large class of people of whom they who seek the benefits of traditionary evidence are part, the very foundation upon which rests the force of such testimony is rooted up ; the legal conclusion which arises from tradition of relationship is rebutted, and proof of pedigree in that manner fails. The pre.sumption which springs from traditionary evidence in proof of pedigree, is not one of mere law, — is not a presumption <em>juris et de jure. </em>A question of fact enters into the consideration thereof, and is first to be determined, to wit, the usages of men concerning marriages. Such a presumption is then open to be <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>rebutted by proof of a custom differing from the usual one,' and applicable to the case in hand, or by counter presumptions.</p>

It is difficult to imagine a more conclusive reply to the plaintiff’s <em>primé facie </em>case, and one which would make it more necessary for him to resort to the strict and formal proof of marriage and legitimate birth. The offer of evidence of the defendant below raised none of the embarrassing questions as to when evidence of a usage is admissible, or to what extent it must be shown to exist; it was simply to show a fact concerning the well-known habits of negroes, of whom the plaintiff below was one, in a large district where such habits were in vogue, and from which district he and his alleged ancestors came; which fact, when established, was a complete rebuttal of the presumption arising from the plaintiff’s evidence, and upon which the verdict was obtained. In excluding such testimony so offered by the defendant below, it is conceived the court was in error. The-offer was in consonance with the theory of all trials at law; it was pertinent to the issue, and in reply to the plaintiff’s case.</p>

There is no rational ground upon which marriage can be presumed, when, in a majority of instances, marriage does not occur. It is upon the same principle that the well-known maxim of law, “ <em>Seviel furibundas semperfuribundus prcesumitur,” </em>is founded: Matthews’ Presumptive Ev’. 20.</p>

In order to succeed in a disputed title to land, the claimant must not only prove his relationship with the first purchaser, but also that there is no one having an intervening right inconsistent with his claim. In this case Isaac Johnson, if living, is of equal degree with the plaintiff; and concerning whose alleged death arises the remaining question on the record. The instructions of the court, <em>concerning </em>the presumption of death of Isaac Johnson, arose from a misconception of the testimony of the only witness to that point. The undoubted presumption from this testimony is the continued life of a man, who was living when last heard from. There is no ground whatever from which a counter presumption could arise. Not even had the death of Johnson ever been rumoured, and the length of time that had •elapsed since the person in question was heard from, is very -simply accounted for by the fact that he lived at a very great <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>distance from his wife, and in an unlawful connection with another woman, with every motive for keeping beyond the reach and knowledge of a former wife, who could and probably would cause his arrest on a criminal charge, when his whereabouts became known to her.</p>
