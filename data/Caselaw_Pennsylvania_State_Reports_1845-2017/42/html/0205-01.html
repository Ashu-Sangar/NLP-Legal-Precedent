If you believe the evidence of the defendant’s witnesses, there is'no other; — their evidence showing that there is a gradual slope from the bank of the stream up to this ridge. They show, too, that this is a well-defined ridge or ledge, connecting at or near the point indicated by Mr. Mason’s line, _ and extending along the hill, above the slope, until it crosses the Cash tract, then changing its course, recrossing that line, and intersecting the line of the Hardy tracts some distance below the corner marked E. on the map.</p>

They testify that this continues a prominent, well-marked ridge until it intersects the Hardy line. If there is such a ridge as these witnesses describe, it would undoubtedly form <em>the ridge or hrow of land </em>on the east side of Raven Hollow, and corresponding more nearly in its direction with the line plotted on the draft than does the other ridge, it should he regarded as the boundary intended by the parties. In that event the plaintiffs would be entitled to recover, as the land upon which the timber was cut lies between this and the ridge claimed as the boundary by the defendants. The question is one of fact, and not of law. The parties agreed to divide their timber, and at this particular locality to make the ridge on the east side of Raven Hollow the boundary, running up said ridge to the line dividing the Hardy tracts — thence to the line between Cash and said company. The ridge referred to is not the stream winding through the lowest depression in the valley, nor is it the bank of the stream, nor the gradual slope of land lying between the bank and the ridge, or brow east of the hollow, but it is the first prominent, well-defined brow of land bounding' the hollow on the east, and if such a one exists as that described by plaintiffs’ witnesses, it would constitute the boundary intended <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>by the contract. But if the jury should find that no such ridge exists, and that, in accordance with the evidence of defendants’ witnesses,the land slopes gradually from the bank of the stream up to the base of the ledge of conglomerate rocks, and that this ledge is the only ridge on the east side of Raven Hollow (except the high mountain still further east), then this is the intended boundary, and as by this boundary the timber in controversy would form a part of the allotment to Charles Wells, under whom defendants claim (if you thus find), your verdict should be for the defendants.”]</p>

It was fully conceded, on the argument, that the “ ridge or brow of land, on the east side of Raven Hollow to the line dividing the Simon Hardy and the James Hardy tracts,” was, to the last-named point, to be the dividing line of the timber between the parties. All on the east of that boundary was to be Brown &amp; Rockwell’s — all on the west, to belong to Wells, under whom the defendants claim. This was not the entire line between the parties, but is the only portion necessary to notice in considering this case.</p>
    <p id="b208-11" data-blocks='[["BL_208.11",208,[325,1666,1157,342]]]'>It became absolutely necessary, in order to determine the question of the alleged trespass, to determine where this boundary existed on the ground, and to ascertain this, much testimony was given which was submitted to the jury with instructions that if the defendants had cut timber east of it, they were within the plaintiffs’ lines, and trespassers; but if- the cutting was on the west, then they were lawfully on their own ground.

There was no actual line run, fixed, or agreed upon, so as to preclude inquiry by the jury. The rough pencil tracing on the diagram, which was before the parties when they agreed upon a division, contained neither courses nor distances, and but indicated a conjecture as to the course of the ridge, agreed to be the boundary. It could not be located on the ground for want of such courses and distances, and it left the natural boundary as it might be found to exist, the dividing line. It was essential <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>that that should he ascertained in order to fix the rights of the parties in the contest. In order to do so, surveys were made, and these became the evidence on the question of the location of the agreed boundary, and were for the jury. Where a line or boundary is disputed, it is always a question of fact for a jury. It was properly so treated here.</p>
    <p id="b209-6" data-blocks='[["BL_209.4",209,[139,645,1168,946]]]'>The idea that the initials of the plaintiffs, placed upon the diagram or rough draft, fixed the location of their land, as contended for by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, so as to relieve all inquiry into the fact of where it was situate by reference to the line, I fail to comprehend. Had the division been by tracts, this would have been a good designation, and then the only thing to be done would be to locate the tracts. But this was not so. The brow of a ridge, the agreement declares, shall be the boixndary. The “ initials” would indicate no locality, if the identity of tracts were not to be preserved. The territory claimed by-the plaintiffs could not be defined by the location of such initials on a draft. This would be idle. The object of the initials was to indicate that the land east of the ridge was to be in the possession of the plaintiffs, and on the west, in the defendants. The boundary agreed upon, when ascertained, would determine the division. The initials amounted to nothing. The evidence of where this boundary was, being all submitted to the jury, as it was proper to do, they found that the timber cut by the defendants, for which this action of trespass was brought, was all on the west side of the dividing line, and consequently their verdict was in favour of the defendants. As we discover' no error in the record, The judgment is affirmed.</p>
