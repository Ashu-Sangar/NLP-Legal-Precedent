The recital shows its object to have been to <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>secure a debt already due to the mortgagee, the appellant, and also such further advances as he might make for the liquidation of debts due by Samuel Porter, deceased, of whom the mortgagors were the widow and heirs, he having died intestate. The condition is in these words: “Provided, nevertheless, that if, at any time hereafter, the said indebtedness to the said John B. Myers, now existing as aforesaid, and all other indebtedness to him or his mercantile firm, either for debts or liabilities of the estate of the said Samuel Porter, which may hereafter be paid, in whole or in part, by him or them, in any manner, by reason of these presents, or for account of said estate, shall, with lawful interest thereon, be fully paid and satisfied; then and from thenceforth, as well this present indenture and the estate hereby granted, as all and singular the powers, rights, and authorities respecting the premises hereby conferred upon the said John B.

If, therefore, he used the power to collect rents, he is in fact accountable as a mortgagee in possession. When he does not use it, but the rents are collected by the owner of some of them, he is not accountable to any one. In fact, he is accountable for whatever money he actually receives, either on account of this - security or in discharge of it, or of any advances or joayments he has made, agreeably to the spirit and intent of the provisions of the mortgage. Whatever sums he has received, he is to be charged with, and he is to have credit for every legal payment or disbursement, and whatever balance is in his hands he is bound to apply in discharge of the principal and interest due on the mortgage.</p>

All the rents of the other houses, as well as those of No. 1 to No. 10, after the 1st of January 1852, were received by the mortgagors, or some of them, and for which they are accountable to each other as tenants in common.</p>
