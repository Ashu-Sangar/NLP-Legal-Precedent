Allinson &amp; Co., in 1818, but it is in Webster, and his definition is — settled, established, <em>regular; </em>occurring <em>at </em>regular <em>times, </em>not occasional, as <em>stated </em>hours of business — fixed, established, as a stated salary. Webster defines <em>regular </em>— conformed to a rule, methodical, periodical ; and the adverb <em>regularly </em>— in uniform order, at certain intervals or periods, as day and night <em>regularly </em>returning. So also the word ordinary, a synonym of regular, is defined methodical, regular, <em>according to established order. </em>In legal phraseology, we speak of an account stated, a case stated; and where damages are fixed by contract they are styled liquidated, stipulated, or <em>stated </em>damages.</p>

Webster defines adjourned as an adjective, existing or held by adjournment — as an adjourned session of a court, opposed to stated or regular. When, therefore, it is enacted that if a school director neglect to attend any two regular meetings of the board in succession, without a legal excuse, his seat may be declared vacant, it would appear to be certain that the word regular in this clause can only be applied to such meetings as we have seen are clearly within it, and not to meetings which may be called in rapid succession, by the president, at any point and any time, the whole resting entirely in his discretion.</p>
