      <em>Bispham </em>and <em>Bawle, </em>for plaintiff in error. — In furtherance of the moral principle that men should pay their debts, the laws of civilized nations generally provide for that end by subjecting the debtor’s property to involuntary sale, and it is part of the scheme that the property should bring as high a price as possible, both for the sake of the creditor and of the debtor himself. This end is best secured by rendering the title of the purchaser as unembarrassed and free from encumbrance as may be: Willard <em>v. </em>Norris, <a href="/rawle/2/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Rawle 56" data-case-ids="1820579" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0056-01">2 Rawle 56</a>; Presbyterian Corporation <em>v. </em>Wallace, 3 <a href="/rawle/2/0056-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Rawle 56" data-case-ids="1820579" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0056-01">Id. 109</a>. It is submitted that the combined result of judicial decision and of legislation upon this subject is, that the purchaser takes his title clear of all encumbrances, except those which have been expressly or by necessary implication preserved by legislative enactment. Hence arise two classes of cases: — 1. Those where the lien of the encumbrance retains its grasp upon the property, notwithstanding the sheriff’s sale; and 2. Those where the encumbrance, being discharged by the sale, is payable out of its proceeds. Each of these classes is well defined. But a third and an anomalous class of cases has been rather recently introduced by the legislature, with respect to a particular kind of encumbrances, viz., <em>municipal claims, </em>which are not excepted from the second class; that is to say, not being preserved by legislation, they are discharged by the sale; and yet which, under certain circumstances, come within the first class, that is to say, although discharged by the sale, yet if the proceeds of sale are insufficient to reach them, their lien is preserved. The uncertainty thus produced to the purchaser, makes it necessary to inquire whether these statutes shall be applied to any cases which do not come strictly within their enactment. That municipal claims for curbing, paving, &amp;c., <em>do </em>come within their enactment is not denied, and must be submitted to, but the question here is, whether the enactments also embrace current taxes, and taxes for which no claims have been filed.</p>

Real estate may be, and has often been swept away from its owner, who has had none but a constructive day in court, against whom the plaintiffs have extraordinary indulgences, and for whom it has left little defence. Still, this is a part of a system, which system consists in a certain high efficacy given to certain demands, when transferred from corporation books to the records of a court, and made claims in a technical sense, — which can be returned upon certificates of search by an officer appointed for the purpose, who is liable on his official bond for every omission of any such claim. This is at least some protection to owners and intended purchasers. They have none, so long as the demand rests merely upon the tax-books of a corporation.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b196-6" data-blocks='[["BL_196.4",196,[323,524,1163,343]]]'>The argument of the plaintiff in error upon this point turns solely upon the construction to be given to the word “ claims” in that section of the Act of Assembly, rvhich provides “ that the lien of such claims shall not be divested by any judicial sale as respects so much thereof as the proceeds of such sale may be insufficient to discharge and pay.” To this word “claims” he seeks to give the most confined and technical sense. This view of the case may be opposed by the following considerations:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b196-7" data-blocks='[["BL_196.5",196,[325,867,1158,76]]]'>1. The word “ claims” is used throughout the act in its popular sense.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b196-8" data-blocks='[["BL_196.6",196,[323,952,1163,249]]]'>2. The object of the act in providing for the filing of claims is to facilitate the collection of taxes and municipal charges by providing the’ proper machinery for the purpose. This is still further made manifest by the fact that, by the very terms of the act, these claims are stripped of their technical character, and are made evidence of the facts set forth in them.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b196-9" data-blocks='[["BL_196.7",196,[322,1210,1164,206]]]'>3. The claim is but the adjunct of the lien, and derives whatever force it has from the lien. The lien is what is intended to be protected, having a distinct creation by Act of Assembly, and taking in the claim by virtue of its superior efficacy. The lien exists even if no claim be filed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b196-10" data-blocks='[["BL_196.8",196,[321,1425,1163,426]]]'>4. By the Acts of Assembly providing for the registration of taxes, a peculiar species of notice is furnished to all purchasers and third parties, even if that were necessary in the case of taxes, which it is submitted is not. They constitute likewise all that is necessary to give complete effect to the lien, as such, and their operation must be to dispense with any other public statement, or recording of the same, or we must suppose them useless and absurd. These acts would seem still further to show that <em>the </em>filing of a claim is intended <em>to be </em>merely instrumental— a lever to put process in operation, and effect a sale.</p>

If the view of the plaintiff in error be correct, the filing of claims in time to prevent enormous loss to the city, under the present system, is impracticable. The beneficial operation of the Act of Assembly in the great majority of cases, would be lost. How thoroughly the legislature has attempted to guard against failure of the public income from such causes is shown by the clause of the Act of Consolidation, above alluded to, providing for the continuance of the lien of taxes, even in cases where they are not registered.</p>

That occurred on the 6th of August 1860. Claims for these taxes had not been filed, and were not presented to the sheriff, as the claim for the taxes of the three preceding years were. The taxes of 1859 were registered, those of 1860 were not, and perhaps were not levied at the time. Did the sheriff’s sale divest the lien of these taxes, or perhaps rather, did the purchaser take the property discharged of them ? Most certainly a construction that would deprive the public of the ordinary taxes, the only means government possesses to carry on its functions, and protect the persons and property of its citizens, should spring out of some very inflexible rules, and be clearly within some exception to the general requirement that the annual taxes shall be paid. Every man knows this to be the rule, and he ought to show his exemption very clearly to escape it. This applies to purchasers as well as ordinary owners.</p>

By the Act of 1846, registered taxes remain a lien for five years from the 1st of January succeeding the year in which they are assessed. In all the sections of the act in which the subject is referred to, unpaid taxes, whether registered only, or registered and filed, are denominated “ claims” for taxes. This is, we think, undoubtedly the meaning of the act, and the lien of registered taxes extending five years, comes within the saving of the sixth section, which provides that “ the lien of <em>such claims </em>(those mentioned in the act, taxes, &amp;c.) shall not be divested by any judicial sale, as respects so much thereof as the proceeds of such sale may be insufficient to discharge.” We think the expression “such claims” is to be construed in its general or popular sense. No argument or reason has been presented to create a doubt of this, and it comports best with the principle of the tax laws, as well as the public interests. How otherwise can the public be protected? The city cannot be at such sales, and unless the state and city taxes be protected, by requiring the purchaser at a public sale either to bid so as to cover taxes due, or take the property subject to those remaining unpaid by his bid, these amounts must be lost, and the property of others must make up the deficiency. This would be shamefully unjust, and especially so, as a purchaser may inform himself beforehand fully as to the unpaid taxes. The registration will show him that. The taxes of the current year fall upon the property, and are payable as accruing on the ownership of it, like that of any other owner; such was the case with the taxes of 1860. They were not due when the sale took place. The period for completing the assessment had not expired. After that the rate per centum Was to be fixed, and appeals held. Strictly speaking, this year’s <a id="p198" href="#p198" data-label="198" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*198</a>tax accrued after the sale.
