On this point, the law is this: If thfe injury referred to, is occasioned by any of those extraordinary and unusual floods, not expected, and against which ordinary skill and foresight is not expected to provide; if the damage complained of, is caused by defendant’s dam combined wdth an act of Providence, he is not responsible; but .if the floods or freshets referred to, are.only those which occur so frequently, that men of ordinary prudence might reasonably be expected to calculate upon them; if they are the usual, ordinary, and expected freshets which occur in all streams, the defendant was bound to take them into consideration and, provide for them when he erected his dam — the law being, that he who erects a dam is responsible for all the- injury caused by it in times of freshets of that character ; and it is no answer to this, that he has raised it no higher than the- difference of level on his own land. Such- is distinctly stated to be the. law of Pennsylvania in Bell <em>v. </em>McClintock, 9 Watts, and McCoy <em>v. </em>Danley,'8 Harris. [The defendant makes a point here which requires some notice. His .position is, that by the terms of the Neiss deed in 1816, originally granting the right to carry this mill-race over the intervening tract, the easement thereby created was expressly limited and restricted to the use and service of the old clover-mill therein mentioned; and, that on its destruction and abandonment, the right therein created ceased and reverted to the heirs or grantees of the grantor, and that the plaintiff or those under whom he claims <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>title, could not afterwards continue to use it in connection with the present grist-mill subsequently erected a little further up the stream; and that, therefore, plaintiff cannot recover in this action unless the water was backed beyond the line between Groman and plaintiff.</p>

There, however, there were strong and absolute words of exclusive limitation — much stronger than occurs here. The words were ‘to and for the use and service of a certain mill, with the land thereto belonging, <em>and fot' no other use whatsoever.’ </em>Besides these, there was an absolute and entire diversion of the subject of the grant from the purpose for which it was granted, and a conversion of it to another and different use altogether. The mill-dam to which the race was appurtenant and both of which were declared to be for ‘ the use and service’ of the mill, was drained and converted into meadow or grass land, so that the dam, and <em>per </em>consequence, the race could no longer subserve the purpose of that or any other mill that might be erected in its stead.

Business may so change as to render it expedient to substitute a grist for a clover mill, or a cotton for a fulling mill. Is it a reasonable construction, that this perpetual privilege was to depend upon the endurance of a perhaps rickety, tumble-down, old-fashioned mill, limited to a special purpose ?

If before, it may wrell be doubted whether the defendant or any one else than the heirs of the first grantor (who would then be the reversioners) can be heard to set up their reversionary title in bar of the action of a party in the actual use, occupancy, and enjoyment of the disputed easement during a period of very many years, brought against a stranger thereto for a disturbance of that enjoyment.</p>

The forms for declarations in actions brought to recover- damages for backing watpr, all set forth that actual injury has been done. Pastorius <em>v. </em>Fisher and Ripka <em>v. </em>Sergeant certainly do not warrant the court ruling the point as they did. The plaintiff does not own the land through which the tail-race runs. He merely has a right to this race over it. If the plaintiff actually owned the land through which the race runs, a very different question would be -presented for the consideration of the court. In Cooper <em>v. </em>Hall, 5 Ham. (Ohio), it is decided that “ where by erecting a mill-dam the water is flowed back in the stream and raised against .the land of an adjoining proprietor, no action-lies unless some actual injury .is sustained.” The strong arm of the law redresses real and substantial wrongs, and not fancied and imaginary grievances.

The right to this tail-race, created by the Neiss deed, is a, special grant of a race for the use of a clover-mill.

The point embraced in tbe first specification of error did not necessarily arise in tbe case : for tbe evidence clearly established an actual injury to the plaintiff’s mill by reason of the backwater ; and the jury, in rendering their verdict for $50, were satisfied that actual injury had been sustained. The <em>narr. </em>set forth an actual injury to the mill and water-power of the plaintiff: and that the suit was brought to recover damages for such injury: and the plaintiff’s testimony proved the actual injury, not merely by back-water in tbe tail-race on Groman’s land, but by back-water in the tail-race on his own land, and on the wheel of his mill. The court, however, charged the jury upon the abstract question, that the plaintiff was entitled to recover without showing actual injury. In this there certainly is no error; for, both upon principle and authority, this is the law of Pennsylvania : Pastorius <em>v. </em>Fisher, <a href="/rawle/1/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Rawle 27" data-case-ids="1819358" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0027-01">1 Rawle 27</a> ; Ripka <em>v. </em>Sergeant, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 9" data-case-ids="481743" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0009-01">7 W. &amp; S. 9</a>.

The charge of the court complained of in the second specification of error was not invoked by the plaintiff below. He needed the aid of no such direction; for the evidence established that he had, by an adverse user of this race for more than twenty-one years, for the purpose of his grist-mill, acquired the right to enjoy it as a tail-race for that mill, as fully as if it had been granted by deed; and it was upon this ground that his counsel presented this branch of the case to the jury. It was clearly proved that the plaintiff and those under whom he claims, had used this race as a tail-race for the grist-mill without interruption continuously, and under a claim of right since 1834, or thereabout.</p>

Admitting, for the moment, that there was a misdirection on this point, it could not possibly have injured the defendant; for a right by adverse user of more than twenty-one years had been shown to be vested in the plaintiff. The defendant, therefore, was not injured by the refusal of the court to charge as requested'; for it would not have produced a different result, if they had done so. The court, however, did not err in refusing so to charge. The grant was not made upon any condition, the breach of which would work a forfeiture of the right granted.

Not by the owner of the land, or by any one claiming an interest therein, over which the tail-race passes; not by one either a party or a privy, but by a stranger to the title — a mere intruder, who, without colour of right, has intruded into this tail-race by the backing of the water of his mill. Surely, it is not for him to allege a misapplication of the grant. The only person who could complain, if we are misusing the grant, is David Groman, over whose land the race passes; but neither he, nor any one under whom he claims title, have, from 1833 or 1834, when the mill was built, alleged, or in any way pretended, that we were guilty of a misuser: Swartz <em>v. </em>

He had no interest in it, present or reversionary. If the plaintiff’s right to an easement in it had been but at the will and pleasure of the owner, or existed upon any other terms, it was no concern of the defendant that the original use of the tail-race may have been to some extent changed. Whether the erection of a grist-mill was a material change, so as to affect the original grant, was a question which could only be moved between the original parties, their heirs or assigns. It did not concern the defendant. It seems that the plaintiff had so used it in its changed form, without molestation from the owner, for more than twenty-one years. This would constitute a good title against all the world, only controlled by some act or acknowledgment which would rebut the right incident to time and occupancy. It is manifest, therefore, that the defendant could not question the plaintiff’s right, or the extent of his enjoyment of the tail-race on this Groman tract.</p>
    <p id="b67-8" data-blocks='[["BL_67.8",67,[131,1354,1165,816]]]'>An action for the disturbance of the enjoyment of the easement was an incident of the right. Any unauthorized interference with it, so as to diminish the full enjoyment of it, was a wrong, and might be redressed by action. Flowing water back on the land of another is not answered by the plea that the portion so flooded was not thereby depreciated. The law implies damages for such an act, not alone for the present injury but also to preserve the rights of property, distinct and free from encroachment. The ease of The Delaware and Hudson Canal Company <em>v. </em>Torrey, 9 Casey 143, is fully demonstrative of this doctrine. I may daily walk through my neighbour’s enclosures, without any appreciable injury, but if such a plea would protect me in a persistence therein, my trespasses would in time ripen into a right. To prevent this, the law redresses by action where the injury is confessedly inappreciable. It was, therefore, undoubtedly actionable to set the water back in the plaintiff’s tail-race, and the court committed no error in the charge on this point of the case; nor in referring the facts to the jury, together with the question of damages.</p>
