That the road in question was an old road as far back as 1817, has been shown by the oldest witness on the stand, and that it was used and occupied, since that time, by Joshua Cloud, and those from whom he purchased, continuously and uninterruptedly, without objection and without leave from the parties over whose land it passed, is fully shown. Such an use, says the Supreme Court, constitutes of itself an adverse occupancy, and, if continued for twenty-one years, is a title which cannot be afterwards disputed. If the jury believe the testimony to this point, Joshua Cloud had .acquired a right to the occupancy of the road on or before 1841. At that time at least his title was complete if he had any. Prior to that period there is no testimony which would seem to deny his right. Admitting, then, his right at that point of time, the question arises whether anything has been said or done since which would either weaken or destroy his right, or which would explain his use, and account for his occupancy of the road. The putting up of the bars at the end of the road next the Strasburg road, the alteration of the bed of the road at that place, and the subsequent hanging of the gate, do not, in my opinion, affect his right, or, under the circumstances, afford any explanation inconsistent with the legal presumption of a grant.</p>

Nor is it necessary for the defendant to proclaim by words, in the face of the owners of the land over which the road passes, that he used it under a claim of - right. If, as I have stated, he has used and occupied it for a period of twenty-one years or upwards, uninterruptedly and continuously, with the knowledge of the owner of the land, without leave granted and without objection, the law presumes a grant which, of itself, implies adverse holding under a claim of right.</p>

Does the testimony of John Woodward and Ann Tuton repel the presumption of a grant, and deny the adverse occupancy of the easement ? It will be remembered that the use of this road commenced long before Joshua Cloud became possessed of the premises now in his possession, for you will recollect that the oldest witness speaks of the road as an old road in appearance when he first knew it, at an early period in life. Joshua Cloud found the road there, and used it as it has been used before.

If he has, then he has committed no trespass, and the verdict should be in his favour. If he has not done so, or if the plaintiff has succeeded in satisfying you that the way was used by Joshua Cloud under sufferance, or in a way which does not raise the presumption of a grant, then your verdict should be for the plaintiff.

The proposition in our fourth point was distinctly propounded, pertinent, material to the issue, and legitimately arising from the evidence, and entitled to a direct and unequivocal answer. It was capable of a distinct, intelligible, unequivocal answer. The defendant claimed by long use, affording ground for the presumption of a grant. The plaintiff averred that the use was by favour and sufferance and not adverse. The testimony of the plaintiff’s witnesses was, that <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>Cloud admitted repeatedly during a period of ten years, while using the way, that he was using it, and had used it, under favour and by sufferance. The question which the court was asked to answer was, whether this testimony, if believed, repelled the presumption of a grant. Why should not the court say yes or no ? There was no doubt as to the meaning of the defendant’s admissions. If there had been any, the jury might have been told that they must ascertain the meaning, and resolve the doubt. But if the admissions were clear, as in the mind of the court they were, the legal effect was equally clear, and ought to have been announced.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b108-6" data-blocks='[["BL_108.4",108,[323,882,1167,1536]]]'>But instead of meeting the point, they court avoided it, and complicated the consideration of the real question, with observations which were foreign to it. The fact that the use of the way had been continued more than twenty-one years before the admissions of Cloud were made, was the subject of remarks, which could hardly fail to embarrass and mislead the jury. In one sentence the jury were told that the right of way was acquired by Cloud before 1841. In the next sentence, that his title was complete, if he had any. In the next, that, admitting his right at that point of time, the question was as to whether his acts or. words since would affect that right. But the confusion does not end here. After stating the question to be whether the right acquired prior to 1841 had been weakened or destroyed since, the court proceeded to discuss the burden of proof, to° state the plaintiff’s other points, and then to inform the jury that it is for them to say “ whether the use and occupation was commenced and continued in a manner indicating the assertion of a right, or whether it was by consent specially given, or by license from the owners of the land or not, adding: “ I know of no evidence in the cause which would even indicate mistake, license, or special contract as the origin of the enjoyment.” After thus solving the question as to license, the court returns to the idea of the right being complete in 1841, and to the admissions — “ expressions,” as the court chooses to denominate them — of Cloud, and inquires, “ did Joshua Cloud make use of these expressions with a full knowledge of their import or of his own rights to the use of this road ? If he did, they are conclusive against him, and the fourth point of the plaintiff is affirmed.' If he did not understand his rights when these expressions were used, "then on the supposition that his right was otherwise complete, and the presumption of a grant fairly raised, the fourth point of the defendant may be affirmed.” Thus another turn is given to the question, and the cause is made to hinge on a point not made by either party — the knowledge or ignorance of Joshua Cloud as to his rights during the period from 1841 to 1851, in which he repeatedly declared the fact, that he had used and was using, the way on sufferance. .</p>

      <a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>A leisurely and patient study of the charge may perhaps evolve the leading idea of the court, but this idea has to be winnowed critically from much extraneous and irrelevant dissertation : an office not to be performed intelligently by a juryman who hears the charge but once, and to whom the whole subject is new. The impression which the charge was calculated to make on a hearer was, that the actual use of the way for over twenty-one years prior to 1841 was the preponderating fact. This is urged, repeated, and strongly insisted upon in various forms of phase, and is so interpolated and dovetailed into the general structure of the charge as to become almost the only thing of which the mind, in regarding the whole, takes cognisance.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b109-6" data-blocks='[["BL_109.4",109,[112,892,1168,1159]]]'>The charge on the plaintiff’s fourth point is objectionable also in substance. While the defendant’s testimony tended to show that' Cloud had used the way more than twenty-one years, the plaintiff’s testimony proved, if it proved anything, that the use during that whole period was by license or sufferance, and not adverse. Taking it all as equally credible, it amounted to this, that Cloud had used the road forty years, but that the use had been under favour and by license, and not adverse. The admissions of Cloud went to the whole use, and negatived a claim of right by virtue of the use. It was improper, in the face of such admissions, to answer that any right had been acquired, or to make a point of the fact that, at the time of their utterance, twenty-one years had elapsed. The lapse of time made no differance, if the enjoyment during the whole period was on sufferance. The notion which the court laboured to impress 'on the jury, that the admissions of Cloud made after twenty-one years’ use were to affect the subject of the right very differently from what they would have done if made before the lapse of twenty-one years, is obviously fallacious. The court should have put the cause on the point whether a right was acquired or was not acquired, -and not whether being acquired it was afterwards weakened or destroyed.

Cloud kneAV whether he had used the road on a claim of right, adversely, or by license or sufferance. He had repeatedly stated hoAV he had used it.

If the court meant by the phrase here specified as error that Cloud used no expressions from which it might be inferred that, prior to 1841, he considered his use on sufferance, the charge puts a construction on the admissions different from their natural import, and different also from that which the jury would have been reasonably inclined to adopt. The language of some of the admissions might as well apply to the user before as after 1841. The admissions were evidence for the jury, and it was for .them to determine whether the witness spoke of one period or another, or of any or no period in particular; and the court ought not to have assumed to determine that Cloud had no reference to any use prior to 1841. If the court meant that none of Cloud’s admissions were prior to 1841, the remark ought to have been couched in language less ambiguous. It matters not whether the judge intended to be understood in the one way or the other. The ambiguity is error, even if his meaning was right, for it was calculated to mislead.</p>

The law is correctly laid down in defendant’s first point, but it will not do to rest a presumption on a mere use, where that use has been enjoyed without claim of right, and in consequence of continued professions of thankfulness for the favour. To seek to acquire a right by long use, while deprecating, in conversation with the owner, the idea of an adverse claim, would-be a fraud, which neither courts nor juries would tolerate. Yet the court insisted on regarding the long use as establishing a right, without regard to the fact that Cloud all the while enjoyed it as a favour. The evidence, if of any value, proved that Cloud acquired no right by use; but the court insisted that he did acquire rights, notwithstanding his admissions to the contrary, and make his admissions nothing if he did not understand what those rights were. This, we submit, was glaring error.</p>

The defendant’s fourth point assumed that obstructions thrown in the way by the owner of the land, and the admissions of Cloud that he had acquired no right, were of no importance, because they occurred after twenty-one years’ use; and it was affirmed conditionally, which condition involved two things:— <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>1st. That he had the right of way when he made the admissions. 2d. That he did not know that he had such a right.

It is not denied that these declarations of Joshua Cloud were not sufficient to divest his title, if one had accrued, but that they were of force to 'characterize his user before; and, if believed, showed “ that the way was used under favour, and not adversely.”</p>

It did not follow, because Cloud had been suffered to use the road, that the sufferance had been under “favour.” If he had, in using that road, passed daily in sight of the owner of the land, for twenty-one years, without interruption, it might well be said, in popular language, if not in legal terms, that he had been suffered to pass- there; and yet he would clearly have acquired a right: Garrett <em>v. </em>Jackson, 8 Harris 335. And if he had stated that the sufferance was of that kind, it would clearly have shown that there was not “favour.” Besides, the whole time of this use of the road was not by Cloud; it had been used by his predecessors before him.</p>
