The record shows the judgment of May 4th 1839 was regularly and promptly revived and kept alive until the day of sale, and even if this were not the ease, the sale was perfectly good and effectual as against the defendants, and a mere assignee for the benefit of creditors, who stands in no better position than the debtor himself, holding no interest in the land except in a representative capacity, and not occupying the position either of purchaser, mortgagee, or lien-creditor, nor to be regarded as owner or terre-tenant. There is no allegation that the assignee ever took possession or entered on the management of the estate, but it may be inferred from the answer that the assignment has remained unacted upon from the time of its execution. One tenant in common cannot impugn the ownership of his co-tenant upon any mere inference, or without some positive decided act, of which there should be distinct allegation and clear proof.

Neither the validity of the judgment entered by the court'under which the sale was made, nor the regularity of the process, can with any propriety be attacked in the present proceedings: Hinds <em>v. </em>Scott, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%2019" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="1 Jones 19">1 Jones 19</a>; Dougherty’s Estate, <a href="/watts-serg/9/0189-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 189" data-case-ids="12169292" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/9/0189-01">9 W. &amp; S. 189</a>.</p>

In any event, the trust arising under the assignment made by Mr. Hassinger must, after this lapse of time, be presumed satisfied and extinguished. Nearly twenty-three years have elapsed since it was made. It is not alleged, in the answer, that an inventory was ever filed or security given. It is believed that the facts are otherwise. It is believed, further, that the assignment passed little or nothing; that the assignee never filed an account and never did an act under the trust, and that no claim was ever made upon by him by creditors. He has been dead for many years, and no successor was appointed. If there were nothing else to save the sheriff’s vendee, the court would now, as they have done in many other cases, presume such a trust to be extinguished: Ross <em>v. </em>McJunkin, 14 S. &amp; R. 364; Power <em>v. </em>Hollinan, <a href="/watts/2/0218-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="2 Watts 218" data-case-ids="1840163" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0218-01">2 Watts 218</a>; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Lelar, 1 Harris 22; Drys-dale’s Appeal, 2 Id. 531; Webb <em>v. </em>Dean, 9 Id. 29.</p>

It is not controverted that the judgment-debtor’s land stands liable to execution as long as he owns it, and his judgment-debt remains unpaid. The question of lien is of no value in a case simply between the judgment debtor and creditor; the virtue and value of a lien being only in its power to maintain its hold against the claims of other persons than the debtor himself, as purchasers, mortgagees, and other creditors acquiring liens. It continues indefinitely against the heirs and devisees, but lasts only five years, from the judgment-debtor’s death, as against <em>bond fide </em>purchasers, mortgagees, or other judgment-creditors of the heirs or devisees: Konigmaker <em>v. </em>Brown, 2 Harris 269.

But the question is, whether the judgment against a living debtor shall continue a lien longer than five years, where the debtor has aliened his title in trust for creditors, who remain unsatisfied? The Act of 1798, in general terms, declares that no judgment “shall continue a lien on the real estate of the person against whom such judgment may be entered during a longer term than five years,” unless a <em>scire facias </em>be sued out within such term; and “all such writs of <em>scire facias </em>shall be served on the terre-tenants, or persons occupying the real estate bound by the judgmentPurd. 461. Here there was no service <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>of the writ in 1844, on any one occupying the premises, nor upon the assignee ; nor was any such person named to be affected by the return of two <em>nihils. </em>The question is, whether the assignee is a terre-tenant ? that is, whether he owned the title to the land. The owner of the fee is the terre-tenant: Oahoon <em>v. </em>Hollenback, 17 S. &amp; R. 432; Dengler <em>v. </em>Kiehner, 1 Harris 38; Clippenger <em>v. </em>Miller, 1 Penna. Rep. 71. A terre-tenant, if one who holds the title by deed, must place it of record that the limitation may run in his favour: Act of 1849, Purd. 462, pi. 14. A deed conveying the title must, therefore, be taken to make a'terre-tenant; and that it is in trust to sell in fee, and pay the proceeds to creditors, cannot make him less the owner. He has the fee that he may convey the fee to a purchaser. The terre-tenant is the principal party to a writ, to revive and continue the lien of a judgment: Lusk <em>v. </em>Davidson, 3 Penna. Rep. 229; Sames’s Appeal, 2 Casey 184; Armstrong’s Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0352-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 352" data-case-ids="478320" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0352-01">5 W. &amp; S. 352</a>; Olippenger <em>v. </em>Miller, 1 Penna.

If the assignor remains in possession, service upon him is good, because he is then the occupant under the Act of 1798, and represents the assignee. The occupant and terre-tenant may be different persons, and always are so when the owner is not in actual possession, and his tenants are; but this does not test the question whether a general assignee, for the benefit of creditors, is a terre-tenant or not. The cases 16 S. &amp; R. 425, 1 Penna. Rep. 71, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20379" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="2 Watts 379">2 Watts 379</a>, imply that he would be. The other cases cited by appellant, under this head, only determine that the assignee is not a purchaser, for value of the legal title, without notice of a trust, and therefore to be protected, or, as such, having a right to avoid the fraudulent conveyance of his grantor, under the statutes 13 and 27 Eliz. Pie takes the title as the debtor held it, subject to the trusts that bind him, and the alienations that bound him. None such are alleged to exist here; if they do, let them remain; they are not now here in question. He is-not the less vested with the fee. The bill here a-lso sets forth an assignee in bankruptcy in 1843, who, if not the voluntary assignee does not, would represent the creditors with a power to set aside the fraudulent transfers of the assignors: Weber <em>v. </em>Samuel, 7 Barr 499 ; Moss <em>v. </em>Hanson, 5 Harris 379. The general assignment was effective to pass the legal title in fee to the assignee, and if that sufficed to make a terre-tenant, he was a necessary party to the revived judgment. It divested Hassin<a id="p397" href="#p397" data-label="397" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*397</a>ger’s title and vested it in Miles: Seal <em>v. </em>Duffy, 4 Barr 274, 280; and this though the title had not been recorded : Id.; Klapp <em>v. </em>Shirk, 1 Harris 589; Speed <em>v. </em>May, 5 Id. 91; Mellon’s Appeal, 8 Casey 129. The assignee, therefore, is owner of the title; must be terre-tenant. It is submitted that the judgment of 1844 was no revival of the original judgment to preserve the lien against the lands which produced the rents in question.</p>

Hassinger and wife executed a general assignment of all his property to John Miles, in trust for the benefit of all creditors who should release before the 24th day of July then next ensuing, which trust was accepted by Miles, the deed of assignment recorded both in Philadelphia and in Luzerne county, and several creditors did release within the time specified, whose debts still remain unsatisfied.

Writs of execution having been issued on this judgment, and levied on other lands which the Hassingers had acquired after their discharge in bankruptcy, they applied to the Court of Common Pleas of Luzerne county to open the judgment of 11th November 1844, and let them into a defence. On the 22d November 1848, the court set aside the executions and the judgment, “ <em>and directed that judgment on the scire facias he entered again in favour of the plaintiff against all lands of the defendants, or either of them, upon which the original judgment was a lien.” </em>Judgment was accordingly entered January 7th 1849, and on this judgment Hassinger’s interest in the Newport lands was seized, condemned, and sold at sheriff’s sale, January 5th 1850, to John W.

Manifestly, Hazard and Earp have no interest in these questions. They make no claim to Hassinger’s third part of/the lands. To them it is all one whether that interest passed under the voluntary assignment, under the proceedings in bankruptcy, or under the sheriff’s sale of 1850. But there is a party somewhere, who is directly interested in the questions, and that party is not in court, and has no notice of the present proceeding. The questions presented for decision are nice and difficult, but our decision of them, without all the parties in interest before us, would be mere <em>brutum </em>fulmen.' Wherefore, then, should they be decided ? What decency or justice would there be in deciding a party’s cause before he had been summoned to a hearing? The creditors of Hassinger, either the releasing creditors under the voluntary assignment, or the general creditors under the proceedings in bankruptcy, are most likely that party. If there is no existing assignee to represent them, .one may be raised up. And when they, by a new assignee, or some other representative, appear, to contest the title of Gloninger’s alienees, it will be soon enough to consider the questions now prematurely presented. If we should decree a payment to the plaintiffs of the moneys which the defendants admit to be in hand, I cannot see how it would protect the defendants against the future suit of whoever may legally represent the creditors of Hassinger. Nor would such a decree establish the title of the plaintiffs against such representative. If, on the other hand, we should decree against the plaintiffs, and leave the money in the hands of the defendants, who do not claim it, it would conclude nothing against the plaintiffs in a future contest with a representative of the creditors. In a word, we are called on to decide mere abstract questions, instead of a concrete case between appropriate parties. Every consideration of what is due to ourselves, as well as to parties, forbids us to entertain such a case.</p>
