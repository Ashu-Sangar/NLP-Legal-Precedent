An ice-house or any other building erected by a tenant for years is not within the purview or letter of the act in question: Church <a id="p70" href="#p70" data-label="70" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*70</a>

    <p class="summary" id="b70-6" data-blocks='[["BL_70.4",70,[315,519,1160,765]]]'>Was it not the intention of the legislature to limit the operation of the act of the 17th February 1858, in Luzerne and Schuylkill counties, to coal leased estates ? A statute is to be interpreted as near as may be to the common law. The remedy is not to be pushed beyond the immediate mischief; the mischief in these counties was that mechanics and material-men had no lien on coal leased estates; or it may be the mischief extended beyond coal leased estates to other lessees for years, who erect machinery or fixtures in mechanical or manufacturing trades; though this is doubtful. But certainly it was never intended by the legislature to embrace farm leases, ice-house leases, &amp;c., &amp;c. If this lien is enforced, and the construction of the court below sustained, a new and prolific source of vexatious litigation will arise; mechanics’ liens will multiply <em>ad infinitum. </em>Although a privileged class of creditors, mechanics, and material-men, they have no right to a latitudinarian construction embracing matters neither within the letter or spirit of the law: Bolton <em>v. </em>Johns, 5 Barr 149; Miller's Mechanics’ Lien Law 38.</p>

Whenever an Act of Assembly authorizes a lien to be filed against an interest of a lessee of land, and the lien is so filed, it is presumed to be within the power of the creditor to set forth the kind of interest, and an omission to put at least on record that it is an estate for years, ought to be fatal to the lien. This observance is essential to the safety of owners, purchasers, and other lien-creditors. In this lien the defendant is not described as a lessee of land, but as the owner, &amp;c.</p>

The quantity of interest might be left indeter-. mínate, because it was known that the freehold was bound by a lien. The claim should show that the freehold is not bound by it when a lien is filed against an interest in a term of years; since this interest is the specific object of the lien. In a coal lease mortgage the law requires a copy of the lease to be filed of record, in order that it may be seen upon what the encumbrance fastens. What can be more vague and indeterminate than the words of this <em>lien </em>— “ the interest of the said Septimus Thomas in the lot or piece of ground, &amp;c.” It is no anwser to say that the interest is reduced to a certainty by the evidence in the case. No commissioners can be appointed to ascertain the quantity of interest bound by the lien, as in the case of boundaries to the curtilage. All legal analogies require that when anything is the subject of a lien of record, that it should be described with such <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>precision and certainty that it may be distinguished and identified; or some mode pointed out by which it can be fixed and determined. Whereas an inspection of this lien will not show whether it binds the freehold or a lease for years, in the lot of ground described; although the lien given, if any be given in this.case, is against a lease for years.</p>

The learned counsel for the plaintiff in error insists that this act has reference to coal leased estates, and that the “improvements specified are engines, pumps, machinery, screens, &amp;c.” Whereas it has not the slightest reference to coal leased estates ; nor is “ coal” mentioned. The intention of the legislature was to protect the mechanic and material-man who performed work and furnished materials for and to buildings, machinery, &amp;c., erected and put up by tenants of leased estates on land of others in the counties named. If the provisions and benefits of the act in question were intended to be restricted to claimants on coal lease estates, where was the necessity of this act at all ? The Act of 21st April 1856, P. L. 496, is a general law, and was sufficient for that purpose. But again, in 1854, P. L. 428, the legislature of Pennsylvania had favoured Schuylkill county with a special law for the protection of the mechanics and material-men doing work or furnishing materials to improvements, engines, &amp;c., erected by tenants of coal lease estates on lands of others.</p>

It is clear and simple, and says the lien shall be on all improvements, with the punctuation comma (,) after the words and before the designation of engines, pumps, &amp;c.</p>

No one could be prejudiced by simply claiming to have a lien on the defendant’s interest in the land. And whatever the extent of that interest was, could be, and,, as in this case, was, readily ascertained by the necessary legal evidence. The cases cited by the opposite counsel have reference to the general Acts of 1836 and 1840, and have little application in this cause. The case of Summerville <em>v. </em>Wann, 1 Wright, is not in conflict with our position here. We claim a lien on an entirety — on a thing complete; on a whole building — a new erection and construction, and not on a steam-engiiie, pump, screen, &amp;c.</p>

Smith, the defendant in error and plaintiff below, furnished lumber for the ice-house to the amount of $263.31, and entered his lien therefor “ on the said building and the interest of the said Septimus Thomas in the lot or piece of ground appurtenant to said building.” Though the lease does not specify the purpose for which the term, was let, it was, evidently, for the purpose of an ice-house, not as an appurtenant to some other tenement, but as a storehouse for the deposit of ice for sale and delivery in the neighbouring town of Pottsville.</p>

The act does not require the defendant’s tenure to be set forth in the lien. It extends the general Mechanics’ Lien Law of 16th June 1836 and its supplements, “to all improvements, engines, pumps, machinery, screens, and fixtures erected or put up by tenants of leased estates on land of others in the counties of Luzerne and Schuylkill,” and a proviso limits the lien to the interest of the tenant, and to such improvements, engines, &amp;c., as are repaired or put up by the mechanics and material-men entering the lien, but it nowhere requires, what the objection exacts, a specification <em>in the lien </em>of the defendant’s estate in the premises. The lien in this case is specifically against the “ice-house on"land of the <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>Navigation Company,” and on the “interest of the said Thomas in the lot or piece of ground and curtilage appurtenant to the said building.” The ice-house and the interest of Thomas in the ground necessary to its enjoyment are the objects against which the lien was entered. This was a sufficient compliance with the act, and does not expose the lien to the objections that were successfully urged against the lien in Barclay’s Appeal, 1 Harris 495.</p>
    <p id="b73-6" data-blocks='[["BL_73.4",73,[147,749,1163,559]]]'>The next objection was that the defendant’s interest in the land being a mere chattel interest, was not the subject of a mechanics’ lien. It certainly Avould not have been under the general Act of 1836, 9 Barr 117, 1 Casey <em>521; nor </em>under the Act of 21st April 1856, Purdon 1192, extending the provisions of the Act of 1836 to certain specified additions and improvements, for the Act of .1856 introduced no new principle by which a lien could be entered against a chattel, or a chattel interest, Summerville <em>v. </em>Wann, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20182" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Wright 182">1 Wright 182</a>; but it was to remedy these incapacities of prior acts that the Act of 1858 was passed. A lien on a leasehold interest is expressly given by the latter statute. The adjudications under prior acts cannot therefore be applied to defeat its clear intent and meaning.</p>
    <p id="b73-7" data-blocks='[["BL_73.5",73,[151,1307,1159,501]]]'>But it is said that the legislature meant to limit the operation of the Act of 1858 to coal lease estates in Luzerne and Schuylkill counties. The first reading of the act does give one that impression, yet the word coal does not occur in it, and besides, the county of Schuylkill was already well provided with legislation for liens against coal lease estates, as well as the improvements, machinery, and fixtures peculiar to collieries, by the Act of 21st April 1854, Purdon 1083, and the Act of 21st April 1856, Purdon 1192. This suggestion, therefore, cannot be admitted. The descriptive words are “tenants of leased estates,” and we have no warrant for restricting these words to tenants of coal leases.</p>

Doubtless the word “improvements” in the statute is to have a reasonable construction. It is not to be applied to temporary and insignificant additions, but to such permanent and substantial erections as do essentially augment the interest which the tenant has in the land. An ice-house of the dimensions mentioned in this lien, and erected, not as an outhouse or appurtenant to a man’s residence, but as an independent and separate structure, for purposes of commerce, must be accounted such an “ improvement” as the legislature meant to subject to a lien. This we think is too clear <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>for debate.
