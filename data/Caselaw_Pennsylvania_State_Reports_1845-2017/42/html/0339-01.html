That Benjamin Vandergrift, who was then seised of a lot in Oxford tovWship, agreed with Kenton to convey it to him as security for said debt; that Jacob Vandergrift agreed with Benjamin and Kenton that he, Jacob, would repay Kenton said sum; in consideration thereof Kenton agreed that whenever he should be paid by Jacob Vandergrift said debt of $140, he would, by good and lawful deed, convoy said lot to Jacob in fee, free from all encumbrances; that Benjamin Vandergrift and wife, in pursuance of said agreement, executed a deed, absolute on its face, conveying said lot to Kenton, in fee, to hold as security for the payment of the said sum of $140; that at the time of the said conveyance the lot was not worth the sum of $140, and that subsequently Jacob Vandergrift, with the knowledge and-consent of Kenton, entered upon and took exclusive possession of said lot, which he held, down to the time of the filing of the bill. That, on the 28th of May 1838, Jacob Vandergrift, the complainant, was indebted to divers persons in the sum of $140, and was seised as of fee of a frame messuage and lot in said township, and agreed with Kenton to convey to him the same, to hold as security for the payment. In consideration whereof Kenton agreed with Jacob to pay the said sum of $140 to the persons to whom Jacob owed the same, and that whenever Jacob should repay Kenton said sum, Kenton would reconvey the premises to him, in fee simple, clear of all encumbrances; that in accordance with this agreement, Jacob and wife executed a deed conveying said frame messuage and lot to Kenton in fee simple, to hold as security for said last-mentioned sum of $140. That at the time of the execution of said deed, and to the time of filing said bill, Jacob was and remained in exclusive possession of the premises. That from the date of said deeds to the 24th July, A. D. 1855, Jacob Vandergrift paid Kenton interest on said two sums of $140 each, at the rate of 6 per cent, per, annum; that on or about the 4th of July, A. D. 1855, Jacob, through his agents, tendered to Kenton $280, for the purpose of paying said two sums of $140 each, and also a deed for Kenton to execute, conveying to him, Jacob, in fee, said two properties, and requested him to execute said deed; that Kenton refused to accept said $280, and execute the deed; that Jacob then tendered Kenton $140, and requested Kenton to accept the same on account, and in payment of the debt for which the last of said two properties was conveyed, which was <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>also refused; that on the 4th December, A. D. 1857, Kenton brought an action of ejectment in the District Court against Jacob Vandergrift; that on the trial of said issue, the said defendant set up as a defence, that said properties were conveyed to Kenton, to hold as security for the payment by said Jacob of $140, as above set forth, and that he, Kenton, on payment of said sums, would convey said properties to Jacob Vandergrift; that said Jacob succeeded in establishing said defence, and that the jury in said case rendered their verdict for plaintiff, with this condition, ■“ that if Jacob Vandergrift, the defendant, pay the plaintiff $283, in one year from the 1st day of April; A. D. 1858, with interest, this verdict shall be null and void.” That on the 9th April, a. D. 1857, said Jacob paid to said Kenton, in compliance with the condition of said verdict, $283 in full, the amount of said verdict, with interest, and that Kenton received said sum, and, by his attorney, gave a receipt on the docket of said suit; that the verdict of $283 was the amount of the sum which the jury found due at the time of its rendition from said Jacob to Kenton, for and on account of said sums, to secure the payment of which the said deeds to Kenton were made. Complainant, averring compliance with his agreement to pay Kenton said two sums of $140 each, and also all legal and equitable claims and demands which said Kenton ever had against complainant, in any way or manner connected with said two properties, or with the debts to secure which said properties were conveyed, further averred that, on the 26th March 1861, he had tendered to said Kenton a deed for the said two properties for his execution, with a notice demanding the execution of a proper conveyance from him to complainant for each of said two properties, and that he had refused to execute it. Complainant further alleged a request made by him, for the execution and delivery to him by Kenton of a deed for said two properties, in compliance with said alleged agreement, and the refusal of Kenton to convey to him, by good and lawful deed, the legal title to said two properties, and, that although Kenton had no right to the legal title to said properties, but in consequence of said legal title to said properties being in him, they were greatly depreciated in value, and their sale by complainant rendered impossible; that complainant had suffered and was suffering great loss and damage in not being able to sell said properties, or raise money thereon by mortgage or otherwise, as complainant had been unable to find a purchaser, at a fair price, or mortgagee, while the legal title was not in him; and that he was remediless in a court of law, and could only have relief in a court of equity, and prayed that Kenton might be decreed to execute to him a deed conveying said two proper<a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>ties in fee simple, free of all encumbrances, and further relief, &amp;c.</p>

That at this time Benjamin Yandergrift was the owner of both the lots mentioned in the bill, both of which were bound by this judgment. That afterwards Benjamin Yandergrift conveyed one of these lots to Jacob, who erected a frame house thereon, in doing which he also became involved, and, with Benjamin, agreed to convey both lots to respondent, if he would release his claim against Benjamin, and pay off the debts due by Jacob. That respondent agreed to this, and received from them and their wives deeds absolute in fee simple. That there never was any agreement with them, or either of them, or with any person on their behalf, that the property was to he held as security for the payment of any sum whatever, or that he would, on repayment of any sum or sums of money, reeonvey the properties to them or either of them. That out of kindness to them, he had said once to the justice by whom the acknowledgment was taken, in their absence, that “if they could repay the sums advanced, he would sell the property to them.” That he had no claim for repayment, but had received the properties in satisfaction of his debt; that no interest had been paid to him, but that Jacob had paid him rent for them, which rent was increased from year to year, as the property became more valuable, for which receipts as for rent were given. The tender of $280 and $140 was admitted, but was refused because the sale was absolute, and because, also, the amount for which he took the properties was $462.</p>
