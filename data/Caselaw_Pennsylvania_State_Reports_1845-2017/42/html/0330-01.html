It is also stated in our text-books to be the law: 4 Kent *339, *340 ; 1 Story’s Eq. Jur., §§ 169, 170; Adams’ Eq. *99 (note by Mr. Wharton); 2 Sugd. 29; 2 Chance 143. It is recognised in Flintham’s Appeal, 11 S. &amp; R. 16. In Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Duffield, cited by the appellant, the case might have been decided upon this point, but while disapproving it, the learned judge was not disposed to set it aside as not the law, but put the case on other grounds.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b336-6" data-blocks='[["BL_336.4",336,[315,858,1168,461]]]'>It is said the law is unjust, because it says that, although the appointer did not direct his debts to be paid, yet they shall be paid before his devisees shall take. Precisely the same injustice is worked by law which makes every devised estate subject to simple contract debts. But in the present case, this disapprobation of the doctrine as inequitable, has no foundation. Mr. Bartram is as well the donor as the donee of the power. It is his own estate which he disposes of, and there can be no injustice in making that liable for his debts — in favour of his creditors', who have the highest equity, and against his legatees, who are mere volunteers.</p>

There is nothing in the facts to show that there was any necessity for the existence of a trust, after the conversion of the property conveyed to the trustees. That Mr. Bartram was unable, from a want of confidence by his creditors in him, or from any other cause, to induce them not to press his property, and that the gentlemen named as trustees were able to do this, may have been the case: but the appellant, who gave all the evidence that was given as to the reasons for creating this trust, did not show any want of ability on the part of Mr. Bartram to manage his own estate, or any other reason why he needed protection against his “ acts, encumbrances, charges, contracts, anticipation, or engagement.” It is straining this case very much, to compare it to a trust for a married woman.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b336-8" data-blocks='[["BL_336.7",336,[317,1930,1166,428]]]'>The appellee submits that the form of a trust here ought to be disregarded, in accordance with Kuhn <em>v. </em>Newman, 2 Casey, and the line of similar decisions down to Kay <em>v. </em>Scates, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%2031" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="1 Wright 31">1 Wright 31</a>.

For, although the appointee is in by force of the feoffment or instrument creating the power, it does not follow that his title relates to the time of the feoffment, or date of the instrument: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Duffield, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Jones%20282" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="2 Jones 282">2 Jones 282</a>; Marlborough <em>v. </em>Godolphin, 2 Ves.

The appointees are not in under the deed, as of the date of its execution, May 14th 1849, but as of the date of Mr. Bar-tram’s death, on the 28th June 1867, and of course not prior to the debts. They have not therefore the earlier title: and the argument based on this idea must fail. The recording of the deed makes no difference: Thompson <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 12 S. &amp; R. 463.</p>

Bartram, a resident of the city of Philadelphia, was the owner of certain real estate in the city; and, being so, did, on the 18th day of May 1849, convey the same in trust to his own use for life, and over to such person or persons as he should by will appoint; and on failure to appoint, then to the use of his lawful heirs in fee; the trustees to let and demise the property, receive and collect the rents and income, and pay over the same, after deducting taxes, repairs, and expenses of the trust, to him the said William H. Bartram during his life, as received, and not by way of anticipation, and free and clear of all debts, contracts, and encumbrances incurred or entered into by him. Bartram died abroad in 1867, leaving a will, in which he devised his property to the appellant, Ann Mackason, for life, then over to certain persons named. In a codicil to the will he declares these devises as an execution of the power to appoint.</p>
    <p id="b337-8" data-blocks='[["BL_337.8",337,[138,1793,1169,515]]]'>At the date of the conveyance in trust, Bartram was indebted to a considerable extent, and the property conveyed was sold by the trustees, and after paying off these debts, the residue was invested and the income paid to him by them annually during life. Before his death he again became indebted to several persons, in all to the extent of about $6000, and these debts remained unpaid at his decease. His creditors now claim payment out of the trust funds in the hands of the trustees, which they contend are assets of his estate applicable to their extinguishment, and this is denied and resisted by the appellant. The court below confirmed the auditor’s report, deciding in favour of the creditors, and hence this appeal.</p>

This would be a startling proposition to affirm. It would revolutionize the credit system entirely, destroy all faith in the apparent ownership of property, and repeal all our statutes and decisions against frauds. Every man about to engage in business where there was a chance of loss, would place himself under the pupil-. age of trustees, and everybody’s estates would be passing under settlement deeds and trustees’ accounts through the courts, before, in the natural course of things, the jurisdiction of the Orphans’ Court would attach.</p>

    <p id="b338-9" data-blocks='[["BL_338.7",338,[313,1440,1166,293]]]'>So in Johnson <em>v. </em>Harvey, <em>2 </em>Penna. Rep. 82, Gibson, C. J., states the same thing to be law, and the reasons for it, viz., “ That the statute of 13 Eliz., which proposes to avoid conveyances with intent to delay, hinder, arid defraud creditors, would be of little use if a debtor might put his estate beyond the reach .of his creditors and still <em>get a living from it.” </em>He puts it upon .the statute of 13 Eliz. as void.</p>
    <p id="b338-10" data-blocks='[["BL_338.8",338,[315,1742,1164,247]]]'>Under our insolvent laws such a thing could not be done, for tíre debtor is bound to take an oath that he has not conveyed, transferred, or assigned any portion of his property whereby to benefit himself or his family. While this could not affect trusts lawfully made, on good consideration, it certainly would a trust for the debtor’s own use.</p>

    <p id="b338-12" data-blocks='[["BL_338.10",338,[320,2126,1165,216]]]'>That object is boldly avowed. The trustees are to hold the estate of the settlor to his use for life, free and clear of his debts, contracts, and encumbrances, and pay him the net income after his death to his heirs, in default of appointment; otherwise to, his appointee..</p>

Here we have a direct attempt by one <em>sui juris </em>to guard his own property against his own contracts. In Thompson <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 12 S. &amp; R. 448, decided at Nisi Prius, a conveyance in favour of the wife, of the grantor’s whole estate (and that seems to be the case here), with an expectation of future indebtedness, was held void under the statute of 13 Eliz. as against such debts. There are numerous English decisions cited by the auditor to show that a settlement is fraudulent under the statute of 13 Eliz. where the settlor takes back to himself an estate for life: 1 Atk. 13; 2 Id. 480, 512, 600; 2 Vern. 510. This is just what was in substance said by Chancellor Kent, and Gibson, C. J., cited above.</p>
    <p id="b339-6" data-blocks='[["BL_339.4",339,[145,948,1173,776]]]'>The general doctrine of settlements by one in favour of another who is usually <em>non sui juris, </em>fairly made and without wrong to the creditors of the grantor, the law sustains; but that is widely different from this case. The auditor was .therefore right in holding the estate of Bartram in the hands of his trustees for the payment of his debts'. We do not negative another ground taken in the report, viz., that an unlimited right of appointment in fee renders the estate assets for the satisfaction of the appointee’s debts. This is undoubtedly the English rule: see authorities cited by the auditor, and Haliday <em>v. </em>Peters, 28 Beav. 354. The rule seems to be different when the appointee is a <em>feme covert, </em>unless, as said by Sir John Romilly, Master of the Rolls, in this last case, when the <em>feme covert </em>is guilty of a fraud in her contracts, by holding herself out as a <em>feme sole; </em>in that ease the property would be assets. It is not necessary to decide upon the effect of such a power to appoint by a man or woman, in this case, nor do we give any intimation on the subject; the case was well decided by the auditor on the point already stated in this opinion.</p>
