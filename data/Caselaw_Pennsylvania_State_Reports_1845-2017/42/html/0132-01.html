That in 1818 or 1819, when there were only six or seven families in Pottsville, a trustee or trustees were appointed, who, with John Pott, caused the present log school-house to be erected, which was occupied as a schoolhouse during the rest of his lifetime, to which place he sent his own children to school, and that the same has ever since been so occupied or kept, a period of forty years, with occasional religious services therein.

The Act of the 16th March '1839, P. L. 108, was for the purpose of carrying into effect the intentions of John Pott, deceased, and protecting the rights of the parties as recited in the preamble; that “ John Pott annexed the lot for the erection of a school-house thereon, &amp;c.,” and vested the title in the borough of Pottsville, to be held according to the intentions of the donor — and that to this end trustees were appointed by the corporation.</p>

The council, in the preamble to their resolution, say that the ground was given by John Pott for the purpose of a school-house and burial-ground, and that no appropriation of the ground could be more in accordance with the wishes of the donor than by the erection of a large and convenient school-house, &amp;e. A two-story stone school-house was then erected on the front part of the lot by the school directors of Pottsville, which schoolhouse has been peaceably used and occupied for public schools by said directors for the period of eighteen years, and the log school-house has been so used and occupied by them ever since the first organization of the common school system in Pottsville, a period of twenty-three years. Both buildings continue to be used and occupied as school-houses to the present time, without complaint from any person but the complainant. For a long period prior to the Act 16th March 1839, the inhabitants of the old town plot had neglected to elect trustees; there was nobody to attend to the school-house or burial-ground, no funds provided, the enclosures were broken down, and the graves exposed, and the dead from different parts of the county buried therein. . The trust estate being without a trustee, the necessity for legislation arose. By the Act of the 21st April 1856, P. L. 497, a supplement to the above-mentioned act, the school directors of the borough of Pottsville were authorized to take charge of the school-house and burial-ground, and were made trustees. Another change was effected by the Act of the 16th March 1859, P. L. 154. This act vests the title to the lot in the Pottsville school district; authorizes the removal of the present buildings and the erection in their stead of a new school-house or houses, <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>out of the general fund of school-money raised for like purposes, with other provisions as to borrowing money, &amp;c. That under this act the school directors still claim the character of trustees only, and to hold the lot subject to the uses, purposes, and intent of the original dedication. That they have done no act and intend to do no act in violation of the purposes of the original dedication. That the terms and objects of the Common School Law, as regards the school-house part of the lot, are not inconsistent with the intentions of the donor, or the will of the inhabitants of the old town plot. That the school directors Avill not interfere with the private right of burial in that part which has been so used, but will preserve and protect it; nor will they disturb or violate the depositories of the dead, but protect the graves by a proper enclosure' from the depredations to which they are now exposed. The relatives of some of the school directors are buried there, and they feel a deep interest in the protection of their graves. As the present buildings are dilapidated, and not adaj&gt;ted to accommodate the increased number of pupils, it is the purpose of the defendants to construct upon that part of the lot used for school purposes, a suitable building for the accommodation of female pupils, and to effect this, to remove the log building, and as soon as they can spare the two-story stone building, remove .that also; they desire to erect a building for common school purposes which will accommodate the district, and be an ornament to the place, with a room for a school library, &amp;c. That they will, if required, confine the educational benefits of the school-houses to the pupils of the inhabitants of the old town plot, and lot-holders, or otherwise execute the trust as the court may direct, so as to conform to the intentions of the donor.</p>

The case turns upon the construction <em>or </em>constitutionality of the Acts 16th March 1859, and of 13th April 1859. The court below held that it was not the intention of the legislature, in the Act of 1859, to destroy the original dedication, but that the school directors could act only as trustees to effectuate this dedication, and that as they proposed to violate it, they should be restrained. The defendants below maintained that the Acts of 1859 divested the title of the original beneficiaries to the lot, and conferred the same on the present school district of Pottsville, which proposes to appropriate the same to its own use. If either the court or the defendants below were right in their construction of the Acts of 1859, the injunction was properly allowed to restrain the proposed abuse, for the legislature have no constitutional power to divest the fee, and take away the rights of the original donees and give them to others. The court below held that the legislature acted under a misapprehension of the rights of the parties, and did not intend to divest private rights. This misapprehension is clear. The recital in the Act of 16th March 1859 is, that the lots “set apart and used for school and burial purposes” “are now and for a long time hitherto have been occupied and used for the school accommodation of the whole school district of Pottsville.” And in the Act of 13th April 1859, the lot is described as “ground dedicated by John Pott to certain <em>public </em>uses.” But if the Acts of 1859 did intend to divest the private rights of property in this burial lot, then they are unconstitutional — 1. Because they propose to divest the fee, and not merely to subject the lot to a servitude. 2. Because these acts take private property for private use. And, 3. Because if even the use was a public one, there is no adequate provision for compensation.</p>

The difficulty arises from the dedication not being in writing. It was made about 1817, and in a year or two afterwards a school-house was erected, and has been used as such ever since. Very shortly after the dedication the burial part of the lot was fenced in, and, though the position of the fence has been somewhat changed, it has never been so changed as to interfere with the portion of the lot where the school-house stands.</p>

By the inhabitants of his town plot alone ? It contained but six or seven families when the school-house was built. Were they alone to have the privilege of the school? And the church, if built, were the inhabitants alone to be allowed to attend it ? It is not usual thus to limit the use of either churches or schools. Nay, it is never done, except with schools under our school law. Usually, before the public school system, schools were for all the neighbourhood that could be accommodated at them, and who were within such distance that they could conveniently attend them.</p>
    <p id="b142-6" data-blocks='[["BL_142.4",142,[324,845,1160,462]]]'>And so we must presume this school lot was used: for no one intimates that it was used with any limitation of the ordinary custom of schools. And in 1835 the public school directors took charge of it, as of course and of right, and have used it ever since, without objection from- any one, for the schools of the whole district. We infer from the evidence that the school portion of the lot has been used for the benefit of the neighbourhood, rather than for the inhabitants of his town plot, ever since the house was built, and we do not discover that this is inconsistent with his dedication, and common custom helps to convince us that it was not.</p>

It is no encroachment on the right of burial, but a use of part of the lot for the general purpose intended. It does not injure him that too many may be admitted to the school, for he, not being an inhabitant of the town, has no right of schooling. It does not increase his taxes, but tends rather to diminish them. We do not see how he can object to its being used as heretofore; the school directors would hardly offer to sell it, and there is not much danger of any one buying or accepting a mortgage on such a title.</p>

The territory that forty years ago had but one school, may now in some instances have ten, and yet each school may have more pupils.
