Early in May the salesman of Treadway urged Kusenberg to take the coal faster, and offered to send labourers to pile it up so that it would not be in the way in the yard of the sugar-house. Mr. Kusenberg assented to this, and before May 10th, one hundred and twenty-eight tons had been delivered.

On June 1st 1861, he settled for the remainder of the coal by his note for $94.09, when the salesman of Treadway urged him to take five more tons (of a different lot) at $3 per ton, which he did.

The refusal to charge that Browne, the plaintiff, must suffer the loss occasioned by his negligence is directly contrary to that principle of law and equity which puts the loss on the party whose acts gave rise to the circumstances which occasioned the injury: 2 Kent 614; Story on Agency 56. The facts of the case show that Kusenberg was without blame. The plaintiff had permitted Treadway, who was the proprietor of a retail coal-yard, to have possession of coal suitable for market for nearly a year. His consignees and agents knew the business of Tread-way, and permitted him to retain custody of the coal without taking any precautions to prevent him from treating it as his own. On May 11th, while a portion of the coal was yet unsettled for, Kusenberg, after receipt of notice, invites inquiry, and asks Noble, Hammett &amp; Caldwell to show to him that the coal in his possession is that of Mr. Browne, but they take no further steps until the middle of July. Had he not the right to infer that they had abandoned all efforts to sustain Mr. Browne’s claim ? He was bound by his contract with Treadway to settle on the 1st of June, and he did so because he had not heard from Noble, Hammett &amp; Caldwell in answer to his note of May 11th. On receipt of a notice, such as that sent by Noble, Hammett &amp; Caldwell, he could do no more than acknowledge it, and ask them to follow it up. They were dealers in coal, and must have known that it is not the custom for retail dealers to sell on a long credit, and after Mr. Hammett saw the coal in the yard, it was his duty to have acted with diligence, and not permit Mr. Kusenberg to suppose that he had abandoned the matter.
