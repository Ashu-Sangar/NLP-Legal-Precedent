John Young was the acting sheriff, and was indemnified by J. W. Brundage. At the time of levy, the plaintiff forbade their taking the mare, asserting that she belonged to him, and not to George. This claim was repeated at the sale.</p>

George was twenty-three years old, single, and had always lived in his father’s family, after his majority as before; without bargain or promise of any kind; working in the family and on the farm just as he had always done. It was also proven that he and his father had often spoke of this colt as “ George’s.”</p>

But it was not competent, for several reasons. 1. It was clear from the fact that the mare was kept in the concurrent possession of' plaintiff and his son, on his farm; that, although the property of George, it was liable to be seized as the property of plaintiff. 2. After the debt due to defendant Brundage, no acts of plaintiff and George Roberts could vary his rights. The evidence introduced by defendant, established the fact that both before and after March 1859, the plaintiff had made declarations entirely inconsistent with the ownership of the mare. 3. The parties could not by their acts and declarations make evidence for themselves.</p>

That the mare had belonged to the plaintiff would seem to have been pretty clearly established. She had <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>been bought as his property, and ever after kept upon his farm. This he proved by his testimony in chief, and then rested his cause. To meet the ease thus prosecuted, the defendants then gave evidence of declarations of the plaintiff that the mare was George’s. If she was, it must have been in consequence of a gift or sale; and the evidence was valuable, therefore, only as it tended to make out a transfer of the property in the mare from the father to the son. In rebuttal of this evidence, the plaintiff offered to prove that in March 1859, four months before the execution against George Roberts, the father turned out to the sheriff the same mare, in the presence of the son, to answer an execution against himself. This offer the court overruled, and hence this writ of error.</p>
    <p id="b441-6" data-blocks='[["BL_441.4",441,[147,959,1169,516]]]'>It is very clear to us that the evidence should have been received. It was both competent and rebutting. In chief the plaintiff had only to prove that the mare had been his. A presumption of ownership would then arise and remain until repelled. It was not for the plaintiff at first to disprove any transfer of the property from himself to his son'. When, therefore, the defendants attempted to establish that such a transfer had been made, the defence was met directly by evidence that the son, under whom the defendants claimed, asserted no such thing; that before the execution against him, and after many of the declarations of the father, the son had allowed the father to assert not only possession in himself, but property in the mare.</p>
