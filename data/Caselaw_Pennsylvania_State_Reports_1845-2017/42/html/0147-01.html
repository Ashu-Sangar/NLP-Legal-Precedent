So the act of the other <em>feme </em>covert, Mrs. Highley, was absolutely void. Her husband did. not join, his consent is in no way shown, and the act was therefore a nullity.</p>

The finding of the auditor conclusively settles that there was no real consideration. In the face of that finding, and of the plain facts of the case, the seal was not of the slightest consequence. But no court would permit Mrs. Cressman to be bound by such an agreement, made with her children and her son-in-law, unless satisfied by positive testimony, that she was fully informed of her rights; that there was reasonable ground to believe that the will could be established; and that she acted with her eyes open: Anderson’s Appeal, 12 Casey 476.</p>

Lewis’s repudiation amounted to no more than a release and surrender to his mother of his rights and interests under the same, and to that extent she profits by it, but is not prejudiced in the slightest particular. With respect to the married women, who were parties to the instrument, the reply is the same. Their acts were voidable only, not void. Their husbands have never objected: Reakert <em>v. </em>Sanford, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20168" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 168">5 W. &amp; S. 168</a>; Leeds <em>v. </em>Vail, 3 Harris 187; Heilman <em>v. </em>Bouslaugh, 1 Harris 355.

It sets aside all questions arising from the infancy or coverture of the beneficiaries, and renders the question of consideration equally immaterial. If there was no consideration for her act, then her children are volunteers; but she having created in their favour an executed, and therefore an <em>irrevocable </em>trust, it will be enforced by equity in their favour against her. The signatures of .the children and <em>feme coverts </em>are to be regarded as the mere evidence of their consent to <em>receive; </em>for, upon the appellant’s own showing, they had nothing to <em>give </em>in return. Everything connected with the trust is complete. The trustee has acted in the premises, and has accounted for, invested, and paid over the moneys. The appellant acquiesced for years, and during five years received and receipted to the trustee, for moneys paid to her in conformity with the objects and provisions of the trust. It would be against all the authorities now to allow her to revoke the trust. See Dennison <em>v. </em>Goehring, 7 Barr 175; Ellison <em>v. </em>Ellison, 6 Vesey 656; 1 Lead.

There letters by a mortgagee to defendants, beneficially interested in the equity of redemption, promising that her executors should cancel the mortgage, and containing words of gift, were held upon appeal, affirming the decision below, to be no defence to a suit of foreclosure by the executors of the mortgagee. “ In order to sustain the case of thé defendants, they must make out that this is a valid declaration of trust. I do not think it is a declaration of trust at all, and if it were a declaration of trust it would be invalid, as being voluntary. It is not a declaration of trust at - all, but it was intended merely to be a direction to the executors. Although she speaks of a gift, there is no gift at all, except a direction to the executors, and that is obviously revocable.” “ Even if it were a declaration of trust, it would be invalid for want of consideration, for a mere declaration of trust by the owner of property in favour of a volunteer is altogether inoperative, and the court will not interfere in such case. The case is different where there has been a change of legal ownership, and so a trust has been constituted. Then the court will inquire what the trusts are, but there is no authority in favour of what the defendants are contending for.” Kekewich <em>v. </em>Manning, referred to by the lord chancellor, was a marriage settlement, where the settlor had by deed conveyed and assigned her interest, which was all she could do, in a fund to new trustees upon trusts which eventually gave the property to volunteers.</p>

He died intestate, unmarried, and without issue, and his mother was of course entitled to the whole of his little property, and to the administration. Under the circumstances the mother, desirous of carrying out the will of her son, executed on the 19th Cct. 1854, what is styled articles of agreement under seal, the paper not being drawn by counsel, but by a friend of the family. As Mrs. Cressman was the entire owner of the personal estate of her son, and as many of her children were minors or married women, this paper can only be regarded as her own voluntary act, deriving no aid from its execution also by her children. By this deed she waives her right to administration, and agrees 'that her son-in-law, William M. Lukens, shall take out letters of administration, which was done. The said Lukens is to hold the net estate of the deceased, after paying the $50 thereout to Mrs. Cressman, placing the remainder at interest on good security, paying the interest arising-thereon annually, for the benefit of Lewis Cress-man, an infirm son; that is,' during the lifetime of his mother, <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>said interest to be paid to her in part payment for her keeping of him, and after her decease, or when he shall cease to reside with her, then the said interest to be paid to him, the said Lewis Cressman, during the remaining term of his natural life, and after his decease the principal sum of said estate to be equally divided among the brothers and sisters of the said Lewis Cressman. William M. Lukens, as. administrator, filed his account on the x29th September 1855, which was confirmed <em>nisi </em>on the 14th November in the same year — and then as trustee, according to the deed, took the net estate as appropriated by Mrs. Cressman, and, as we suppose, placed it at interest on good security, and 'regularly paid over the interest to Mrs. Cressman, for the benefit of her son Lewis, up to 1860, inclusive.- On the 27th Eebruay 1860, on petition of Mrs. Cressman, the court appointed an auditor to make distribution of the funds. The auditor disregarded the agreement, and gave the funds to Mrs. Cressman.
