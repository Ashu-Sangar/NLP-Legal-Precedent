There was no claim for immunity because any part of the property was purchased or built with capital stock which paid a tax to the Commonwealth. Throughout our judicial decisions, highways of the character mentioned are treated as great public benefits, and have conferred on them by legislation many of the immunities and privileges of the Commonwealth, such as taking private property for their construction, and many other matters which have never been granted to manufacturing, banking, or other private corporations, in which the public has no interest whatever, except as they tend to improve the country. One case has, however, been pressed on our consideration as decisive of the present case, and which is not of the character referred to: The West Chester Gas Company <em>v. </em>The County, 6 Casey 232.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b428-9" data-blocks='[["BL_428.7",428,[305,2108,1160,303]],["BL_429.1",429,[164,385,1168,1117]]]'>“ Although it is a little difficult to fathom the views of the court in saying that ‘the gasworks are clearly exempt,’ whilst the houses built on the land which the company was expressly authorized to purchase for the purpose, were subject to taxation, yet we must believe that the character of gasworks extends into their considerations. A large portion of its expenditure is made in extending pipes through towns and cities; in carrying the gas <a id="p429" href="#p429" data-label="429" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*429</a>into houses; in the purchase of meters set up in every building; and thus to a certain extent assimilating to highways, which pass over the lands of numerous persons, and which could not properly be laid off and valued. It is one of the franchises of such a company to carry its pipes through and under the streets and highways, and not unfrequently across private property, and in this particular is entirely unlike an ordinary incorporated manufacturing company, which probably has never been authorized to interfere with private rights without the consent of the owner. The same principle would apply to an incorporated water company, for like reasons. Neither gas nor water companies are enumerated in the general tax laws; but we would say, in the' language of Judge Porter, in the case last named, when speaking of the boarding-houses for workmen, ‘ the cause stands on the verge, and we are unwilling to go further.’ That, as well as all the other cases, shows that it was not because the capital stock of thé corporation was taxed, or had paid a bonus for its franchises, that its property was exempt, as all not immediately or necessarily used on the line of navigation or travel, or directly applied to' the manufacturing or conducting the gas, was held subject to the ordinary burdens. Dwelling-houses, workshops, warehouses, coal-screens, schute's, slides, and all machinery and buildings used to make profits and add to the business of the company, were required to pay both state and county taxes in this case; and also in Wayne County a. The Canal Company, and Eailroad <em>v. </em>Berks County.</p>

      <em>“ </em>We are therefore of the opinion that there is nothing in the character, object, or business of this corporation which will exempt any part of its property described in the case stated, from assessment for the customary taxes imposed on similar property held-by individuals for like purposes. If it should go clear, every incorporated cotton-mill, woollen factory, iron establishment, coal company, and hundreds of others throughout the state, would claim like immunity for all their property. In many counties, such as Schuylkill, Carbon, Luzerne, and others, probably one-third in -value of all the property is held by incorporated companies, and should that escape from the payment of.taxes, <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>an undue burden would fall on all other property holders. That alone should not deter us from giving these comqDanies every immunity conferred by law, but public convenience, private justice, and individual hardship should cause us to hesitate, and carefully examine the legislation which is said to confer such privileges, exemption never heretofore claimed or supposed to exist, by any of these various incorporations throughout the state. Taxation, which is intended to be imposed with perfect equality, would often be found to be most unequal. Real estate, and personal property belonging to individuals, is subject to county, state, road, school, poor and municipal taxes, whilst that owned by a corporation would, on the principle claimed, be exempted from all but state taxes, at the rate of one half-mill on each one per centum of its annual dividends, which, in many cases, would not amount to one-half of the state tax alone, according to a fair valuation. It is true that this company has paid a heavy state tax for 1859, having made a dividend of ten per cent, among its stockholders; but many similar companies do not declare one per cent, annually, and consequently their property would escape with impunity. We must not look to favourable cases alone,, which always make bad precedents, but expound the law as applied to all property held by incorporated companies, whether the business is conducted profitably or otherwise. The same rule must apply to the hundred corporations created annually by the legislature for manufacturing or mining purposes, and to the thousand self-created companies, incorporated every year by the. courts; the property all must escape, or all must be taxed.</p>

Double taxation, says Judge Porter, is not uncommon, and the power of the legislature to tax twice is quite as ample as to tax once: 6 Casey 232; And Judge Coulter says, in Saving Fund <em>v. </em>Yard, 9 Barr 361, that it is of daily occurrence, and gives as an instance the tax on land, and on the mortgages and judgments which encumber it, perhaps to its full value. He also shows in that case, that the word ‘persons,’ in the Acts of 1844 and 1846, means artificial as well as natural persons; and if that position be correct, we have the 32d section of the Act of 1844, imposing a tax on all real estate, and nearly all personal property ‘held by any person or persons whatever,’ whilst the 33d section of the same act subjects the capital stock of all incorporated companies to taxation in the manner therein prescribed. The legislative intention to permit no property, real or personal, held by a corporated body to escape taxation, is still more clearly <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>maintained by the 1st section of the Act of 22d of April 1846, which Judge Coulter considers was intended to spread the net broad enough to catch all which had previously escaped. The payment of a tax on dividends and capital stock did not suffice to protect the security for money at interest held by that company, although in the direct line of its business.</p>

But the case may be considered as an exception, arising on the words of the charter, rather than a rule. Every company knows when it obtains its charter, that the stock is subject to taxation under the general laws, and when it purchases real estate, that it stands in the same category with all other property, and it agrees to bear the double burden.</p>
