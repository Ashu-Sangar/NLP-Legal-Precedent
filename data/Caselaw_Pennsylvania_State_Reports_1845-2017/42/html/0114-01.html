One who was appointed attorney in fact, by an old man, to transact his business, bought at sheriff’s sale real estate against which the latter held judgments, and by mistake as to the liens thereon was obliged to pay considerably more than his bid. After the purchase, and a further expenditure in improvements and repairs, he was released from all liability by his principal, who assumed the ownership. After the death of the principal, a bill in equity was filed by the heirs against the agent to compel him to take the property and account to the administrators for the amount expended, alleging decedent’s incompetoncy through mental weakness to execute the release, and that losses had been sustained by defendant’s mismanagement, to which he replied, the release, and ratification of the purchase by the decedent. The widow, one <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>son, and a daughter joined as co-defendants, and in their answer denied the alleged mental weakness of the decedent, when he executed the release. The court below decreed that the defendant should account for the amount expended, and that he should receive a deed for the property. On appeal it. was <em>Held, </em>that where the preponderance of the testimony showed mental competency to execute the release, the acts of ownership by the decedent in his lifetime, his declarations of satisfaction as to the purchase, and that it was made by his direction, were not only evidence of subsequent ratification, but proved an intelligent execution of the power of attorney; that as no fraud or undue influence had been used, and, as no such mental weakness had been shown, as would avoid the release, as an executed contract, the decree of the court below charging the defendant with the entire sum expended by him as agent, and compelling him to take the property, was error.</p>

That the defendant accepted the trust, and thereupon Mr. Aiman delivered to him bonds, mortgages, and other securities for money, amounting in the aggregate to a large sum, among which were two judgments against Isaac Hawkins, of the county of Montgomery, one for $1000 and the other for $500; that, on the 23d of November 1858, the said Hawkins having become insolvent, executions issued out of the Court of Common Pleas of said county, at the suits of other judgment-creditors of the said Hawkins, whose liens were prior to those of the said Arnold Aiman; all the real estate of the said Hawkins, consisting of three separate tracts, was levied upon and sold to Daniel Stout, who directed the sheriff to return the property sold to Daniel Stout, attorney in fact for Arnold Aiman, which was done. That, at the time of the sale, the said real estate was subject to two mortgages, which were prior to all other liens, and were not divested by the said sheriff’s sale; that upon one of these mortgages there was a balance due of $1127.67, and upon the other there was due $531.50, so that the said real estate actually cost the purchaser at said sheriff’s sale the sum of $8534.17. That the whole amount of prior judgments was only $3740.75, and costs $208; that the liens of Arnold Aiman, with interest and <a id="p116" href="#p116" data-label="116" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*116</a>costs, were $1666.04, so that the highest sum it would have been necessary to bid for said real estate in order to pay the amount due Arnold Aiman in full was $5614.79; that the amount bid being $6875, the defendant gave for the real estate the sum of $1260.21 more than was necessary to secure the payment of the whole claim of the said Arnold Aiman. The bill further alleged that the defendant bid for and purchased the property without any previous examination of the title of Hawkins to the real estate, and the liens against it, and in utter ignorance of the legal effect of his bid, and without consulting counsel in relation thereto; but acted in the matter upon his own judgment and responsibility, although he had able counsel employed to advise and direct him in the management of his business as attorney in fact for said Arnold Aiman. That after the sale, tos wit, on the 21st of January 1859, the defendant procured to be executed by Arnold Aiman (who continued to be imbecile and incompetent to transact any business) another power of attorney, giving him much more ample powers than those conferred on him by the first-mentioned letter of attorney. That this second, power of attorney was antedated, and intended to remedy the deficiency in the former power, and to shield the defendant from the consequences of his ignorant and unfaithful conduct, and enable him to throw the loss arising from the purchase on Arnold Aiman. That the real estate, had the title been good, was not worth $6875. That the defendant, discovering this fact, and that his purchase was subject to the prior mortgages, after the sheriff had made return to 'the executions, filed exceptions to the sheriff’s sale, on the grounds, 1. “ That the bids of the purchaser for the real estate were made under a mistake as to the amount which he would be required to pay for the property; he believed, at the time of the purchase, that on paying the $6875, he would get a clear title; but he has since ascertained that two prior mortgages would, if the sale were confirmed, still remain liens on the real estate, thus obliging-him to pay for the property an amount greatly beyond that at which he supposed he was purchasing the same, and much exceeding its true value.” 2. “ That the said bids, amounting in the aggregate to $6875, were the full value of the property, and if the sale were confirmed the purchaser would be subjected to the hardship of paying much more for the real estate than it was worth, and greatly beyond the amount which he inadvertently bid for the same.” That ón the hearing of these exceptions, the defendant offered himself as a witness to sustain the exceptions, and deposed substantially to the truth of the facts therein set forth, and upon cross-examination stated that he made the purchase on his own judgment, without any previous examination as to title or encumbrances, and without consulting counsel, although he had .at the time <a id="p117" href="#p117" data-label="117" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*117</a>counsel employed to advise and assist him about the business of the said Arnold Aiman; that the exceptions were overruled; and the sheriff’s deed was made at the instance of the defendant to Arnold Aiman; that the defendant took possession of the property, and leased it in the name of Arnold Aiman to tenants, who at the decease of Mr. Aiman were in the occupancy of the same.</p>

That the title of the said Hawkins, in the said real estate, was not a title in fee simple, nor any freehold interest, and that the title which vested in Arnold Aiman, by virtue of the sheriff’s sale and deed, was a mere leasehold, not descendible to his heirs, but passing to his administrators as a chattel.</p>

To meet this among other things, the defendant relies upon the ratification-of his acts'by Aiman, and a release by him from all liability arising out of the transaction in which the loss occurred.</p>
    <p id="b123-7" data-blocks='[["BL_123.5",123,[132,1034,1169,730]]]'>It is not necessary to inquire into the measure of relief granted to the estate of the plaintiffs’ intestate, by the court below through the medium of the account taken, as indemnifying against the alleged loss through the supineness of the defendant acting as agent, as we are of opinion that the plaintiffs are entirely precluded by the acts of their intestate from being entitled to any. It might be very doubtful, indeed, if necessary to rely solely on the ground as a defence, whether, under the terms of the employment of Stout to bid in the Plawkins property, at the request of Aiman, for this is the substance of the testimony, he was bound to investigate the state of the liens at all. The latter had lent his money and taken a judgment as security for it on the property, and the testimony seems to go far towards proving the bidding in of the property to have been by his direction and upon his own judgment. But as the defence is mainly placed upon the grounds already stated, we need not discuss this aspect of it.</p>
    <p id="b123-8" data-blocks='[["BL_123.6",123,[135,1764,1168,426]]]'>Was Arnold Aiman <em>compos mentis </em>on the 5th of March 1859, when he executed the release relied on by the defendant? Was he competent to execute a valid contract, and did he continue so at the time of taking possession of the premises, and giving notice to the tenants on the premises that he was their landlord ? If so, then a complete defence is established against the claim of the plaintiffs, to compel the defendant to account for all the money expended by him as agent of their intestate in and about the purchase, repair, and improvement of the Hawkins real estate bought in by him for the intestate.</p>

    <p id="b124-6" data-blocks='[["BL_124.4",124,[322,517,1166,1025]]]'>There was but little testimony, if any, of such a degree of weakness as would bring the plaintiffs’ intestate within the rule of these cases, and none' whatever, of fraud or undue influence. Ten witnesses, two of whom were strongly impeached, were called by the plaintiffs to this point, but their testimony chiefly referred to a defect in the memory of Arnold Aiman, leaving the other faculties of his mind unimpeached. Opinions in a general way were called out from many of these witnesses, to the effect that they did not believe that he was capable of understanding the release at the time he executed it. I have not much respect for such a test. It is apt to be too much mixed with the uncertainty of what degree of intelligence the witness might think necessary to understand such an instrument, to afford any evidence of the strength of the mind under investigation. To such witnesses especially as could not read themselves, or had never seen such an instrument, it might in their opinion seem to require a much greater exertion of intellect than would be necessary to transact ordinary business, while to others familiar with such papers, a very low condition of mental power would be deemed sufficient. This test was uncertain and without much preliminary investigation for its foundation, was improper, if indeed it could be proper at any time. But to this extent and of this kind, was the testimony of most of the witnesses for the plaintiffs.</p>

The number and opportunities of these witnesses, as well as their general intelligence, gave the preponderance greatly in favour of the evidence of sanity of Arnold Aiman, and consequently the validity of his acts, and we cannot well understand .why this was not the conclusion of the learned judge below in view of all the testimony.</p>
