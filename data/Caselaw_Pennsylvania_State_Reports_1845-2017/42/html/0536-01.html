The mere fact of the money being partnership property would not be sufficient, because one partner might take ’a portion of the partnership property and lend it to another, but in this case there are two circumstances which did not occur in Sims <em>v. </em>Bond. One is, that though the account was opened in the name of Farquar, the letters ‘B. C. C.’ were in the pass-book. It is for the jury to decide whether by that, Farquar meant to keep the account on behalf of the company, or whether these letters were a mere private memorandum.” <em>“ </em>However, Sims <em>v. </em>Bond decided that the private name in the pass-book is not conclusive, as by the usage of merchants the name on a bill of exchange, but its only effect is to throw upon the parties suing, the obligation of showing that they were the real contracting parties. The question in this case will be <a id="p539" href="#p539" data-label="539" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*539</a>whether that is made out to the satisfaction of the jury.

Bench Rep. 509, where the farming bailiff of Lord De L’Isle and Dudley (after his employment as such had ceased) renewed a check for 180i. in payment for wheat belonging to Lord Dudley, which he had sold on his account while acting as bailiff, and paid it to his own account, with B. &amp; Co., his bankers, who received the cash for it, and gave the bailiff credit for the amount, but afterwards, on an indemnity from Lord Dudley, refused to honour his drafts, — it was held that even assuming the check had been improperly obtained by the bailiff, still as between him and his bankers, the amount was recoverable by him as money had and received by them to his use, or money paid. Upon the argument Cresswell, J., said, “It is now settled that money paid in by a customer to his banker is money <em>lent </em>to the latter: Potts <em>v. </em>Clegg, 16 M. &amp; W. 321. Money paid out to the customer pays off the earlier debt; if this were not so the earlier debt might be barred by the Statute of Limitations.” Maulé, J., said (p. 532), “It seems to me quite clear that the account in question is a banking account of the ordinary kind, by the plaintiff as his own account with the London and County Joint Stock Banking Company; and that it is not competent to any third party to interfere and to say that the banking company in reality contracted with him. This is plainly evidenced by the way in which the account was kept; it was a general account, embracing as well the plaintiff’s own moneys as moneys received by him in his capacity of agent for Lord De L’lsle, and purporting to be an account between the plaintiff and the bankers only.” Williams, J., said, “If we were to decide otherwise, I think we should be promulgating a doctrine that would be found very injurious to bankers.”</p>

The first was called the “Private or Office Account,” which he was allowed to .overdraw, he stating that he intended to introduce the Rotherwas account. On the 25th of October 1846, he overdrew his office account 1037Z., and on the same day his clerk opened an account to be called the “Rotherwas Éstate Account,” and paid 700i. to the credit of it, stating that the check which Parkes would draw would be so endorsed, and that Parkes wished it to be kept separate from the other account. A third account called “The General Account,” and consisting of his <a id="p540" href="#p540" data-label="540" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*540</a>other clients’ money, was afterwards opened by Parkes.

Parkes became insolvent, and Bodenham filed a bill against the partners in the bank, which was sustained by Vice-Chancellor Kindersley, who decreed the repayment of the 849Z. by the defendant to the plaintiff, saying, “Now then I am constrained to arrive at the conclusion that the bankers — although I must exonerate them from any deliberate intention to commit a robbery or commit a fraud — that the bankers were'not only parties to the simple fact of the transfer^ but were parties to the fraud in question; in this sense that, they were aware of the circumstances which .made it a fraud in Parkes to make the transfer to his private accounts, and béing cognisant of that, and having been cognisant of it before' that'-time' when the account was opened under the name of the ‘Rotherwas Account;’ they being cognisant of that throughout, concur in a transaction the effect of which is that for their own pecuniary benefit an act is done by Parkes,-which is 'a fraud upon the plaintiff.
