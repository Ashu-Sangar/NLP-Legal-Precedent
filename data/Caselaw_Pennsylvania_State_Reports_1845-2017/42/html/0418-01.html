The family ate in the log house most of the -time; occasionally in the neAV house. They continued so always to occupy it for sleeping more or less. About 1858 Webster and his Avife began to sleep in the new house. The chimney was built to that house about the fall of 1857, and they then got a cooking stove, and they had a box stove in it in 1852 or 1858. There were eight or ten in the family, and two rooms in the old house — one room only in the chamber. The roof coming nearly to the floor, some of the children slept there.

I have known a kitchen separated from a man’s house on the surface, but connected by an underground passage, and a very rich man with a large palace of a house, living in the small spare room adjoining the kitchen. The simjole fact, therefore, of changing the uses of different parts of the same house, or deserting or not using the principal part of it at all, affords no ground for alleging a change of residence — nor ought the fact that these two buildings, nearly adjoining each other, and constituting really the residence and dwelling-house of one family, are used at different times for different family purposes, to countenance in the slightest degree a similar allegation.</p>
