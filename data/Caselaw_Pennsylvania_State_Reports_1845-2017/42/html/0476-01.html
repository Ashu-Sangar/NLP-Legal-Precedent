This is an unimportant circumstance. He was a.s truly a <em>bond fide </em>holder as if he had never parted with the note. It is the duty of an endorser to receive back and pay after protest, the bill he negotiated, and when he does so, the relation between him and prior endorsers is the same as if the protest had happened whilst he held the paper.</p>
