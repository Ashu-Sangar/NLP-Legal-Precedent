On the 1st day of March 1858, the Court of Quarter Sessions of that county, upon the petition of divers citizens, appointed viewers to view and lay out a road, “to lead from the York road in Jenkintown, Abington township, starting at a point nearly opposite C. F. Wilson’s store, on a line between the lairds of Benjamin Eleck and John Weeks, thence to the Church road, at Mann’s lane, in Cheltenham township,” which would run through the .lands of the plaintiff. There had been two views previously to this, for the purpose of laying out a road between the same points, but on the remonstrance of the plaintiff, both juries had reported adversely to the road.</p>

This offer the plaintiff accepted, and, on his part, fulfilled the engagement. The jury then reported in favor of the road, which was approved by the court, and it has since been opened.</p>

And what more is this than a compromise of a private injury? — Public roads, though laid out for public use, do frequently subserve the private interests of particular persons quite as much as the public convenience, and the motives for the road are as apt to spring from personal interests as from the public welfare. The defendant adjudged himself likely to be benefited by the road in question, to the amount of the sum he promised to pay the plaintiff. He could not obtain it without the plaintiff’s consent. Having set his own price on the value of that consent, and having promised to pay the price, we know of no statute or public policy Avhich his promise contravenes, and therefore he ought to be held to the faithful performance of it. None of the cases cited on the part of the defendant conflict with this ruling.</p>
