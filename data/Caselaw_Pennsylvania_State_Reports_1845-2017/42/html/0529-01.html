The son agreed to pay the one-half of the indebtedness then due to merchant creditors and others; on account of goods sold to him for that-,store. The business was conducted there for some time by the father and son, when the’father sold his interest in the stock of .goods and partnership property to his son, ’who continued the business in his own name for about eleven months, and then took his brother Charles into partnership with-him. The brothers continued the .business at the same place, in the name of J. &amp; C. Kleckner, and;also opened another store at a place called Port Ann, in the same county. After conducting business at both places for som.e time, they became insolvent and were unable to pay their debts. They -then confessed a judgment in favour of their father for <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>the sum of $5123.47, which was entered in the Common Pleas of Snyder county. They had previously sold out their store at Port Ann, to Huffnagle &amp; Weaver, who paid them part in cash and part with their own notes, which were delivered to the father in part payment of the judgment which they had confessed to him. Huffnagle &amp; Weaver, finding that they were unable to pay these notes, agreed to sell their stock of merchandise to Michael Kleckner, in consideration that he would cancel and surrender them. This stock of merchandise was delivered to Michael Kleckner, who agreed with Joseph Orwig, the father-in-law of Charles Kleckner, to open a store in Minersville, in Schuylkill county, to be conducted by Charles Kleckner, and for that purpose, on the 14th May 1860, gave him a power of attorney. The stock of goods thus obtained from Huffnagle &amp; Weaver were then removed to Minersville, and an additional stock purchased by Kleckner &amp; Orwig, in Philadelphia. The business was conducted for a short time by Charles Kleckner, as agent, in the borough of Minersville, when the store was removed to Ashland, and the business conducted by him there as agent of the plaintiffs ; and the stock renewed from time to time, as occasion required. These are the goods which were taken in execution, as above stated. The defendants alleged that they are the pro perty of J. &amp; C. Kleckner, and do not belong to the plaintiffs; that the judgment confessed by the sons to the father, in Snyder county, was without consideration; that they were not indebted to their father; and that the judgment was confessed for the purpose of hindering and delaying the creditors of the sons.</p>
