D. 1849. This last-named act authorized The Western Insurance Company to act as a mutual insurance company, a power which they never exercised; and it also contained in its 11th section, a privilege which they considered very valuable, and which they did. use during nearly the whole time of their actual corporate existence. This section is in these wmrds: “ The company, for the better security of its dealers, may receive notes for premiums in advance, of persons intending to receive its policies, and may negotiate such notes for the purpose of paying claims or otherwise, in the course of its business; and on such portions of said notes as may exceed the amount of premiums paid by the respective signers thereof, at the successive periods when the company shall make up its annual statements, and on new notes taken in advance thereafter, a compensation to the signers thereof, at the rate to be determined by the directors, but not exceeding 5 per cent, per annum, may be allowed and paid from time to time.”</p>

A meeting of the corporators, pursuant to notice, was held on the 14th July 1852, and fifteen other persons were, by resolution, associated with them, and a committee of seven were appointed to obtain subscriptions to the stock of the company, who were authorized, as soon as sufficient stock was subscribed, to appoint a time and place for the election of directors, and give due notice thereof by advertisement.</p>

The defendants in this suit had subscribed all the several agreements for each year, and their notes had been delivered up to them, and the guaranty commission of 5 per cent, paid on each note to them, until we come to the present note of the 1st April 1857.</p>
    <p id="b48-9" data-blocks='[["BL_48.7",48,[318,1761,1158,514]]]'>These agreements and subscriptions were all in one book, which contained in the front part the 11th section of .the supplement to the charter, and the resolution of the board of directors of the 8th March 1853, and each agreement referred to them specifically. The agreement under which the present note was given reads thus : “We, the undersigned? agree to give our notes dated the 1st day of April 1857, for the sums set opposite our names, under and subject to the terms, conditions, and agreements contained in the supplement to the charter of The Western Insurance Company, in the 11th section of the Act of 9th April 1849, and the resolution of the board of directors of said company.”</p>

The supplement was recognised by the company, who acted under it from the commencement, and he accepted the benefits which he reaped.from giving his notes under it. He was, therefore, liable to pay the balance of his note to assist in paying the losses which- had occurred during the period for which it was given;</p>
