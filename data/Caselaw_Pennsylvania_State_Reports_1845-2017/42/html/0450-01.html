    <p class="summary" id="b450-9" data-blocks='[["BL_450.8",450,[339,1077,1161,256]]]'>This was a feigned issue under the Sheriff’s Interpleader Act, in which D. Stewart, E. Noble, O. F. Ingram, and S. Sweet, partners doing business as D. Stewart &amp; Co., were plaintiffs, and M. S. Wilson, W. C. Ward, L. R. &amp; D. Searle, W. &amp; W. II. Jessup, W. M. &amp; J. A. Post, A.

    <p class="summary" id="b450-10" data-blocks='[["BL_450.9",450,[336,1334,1161,943]]]'>The material facts of the case were as follows: — Some time prior to 7th of May 1861, Post Brothers, of which firm A. L. Post was a member, under an arrangement with Ingram &amp; Smith, erected buildings for a paper-mill on lands belonging to Isaao J. Post, in which his father, A. L. Post, had a life estate. Ingram &amp; Smith ordered the paper machinery. On the 7th of May 1861, A. L. Post and I. J. Post made a lease to the plaintiffs in this issue, for the. buildings and grounds, to take effect on the 1st day of July 1861, and, at the same time, a written agreement was entered into between A. L. Post and I. J. Post with the plaintiffs, by which the Messrs. Post were to furnish certain articles, and do certain labour in said agreement specified, estimated at about $500, and if said labour and materials amounted to more than $500, the plaintiffs were to pay the excess. Under this agreement, the boilers were to be taken from the steam-mill of Post Brothers, and put up some time between the 7th and 21st May. Subsequently a new arrangement was made between the parties, by which new boilers were to be put in, instead of those from the steam-mill, which, according to the evidence, would cost some $300 or $400 more. A. L. Post then agreed with Avery Frink to fulfil this agreement for him, and Frink informed Ingram of that fact.</p>

S. Wilson and others, the defendants in the issue, recovered a judgment in the Court of Common Pleas <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>against William L., Albert L., and Isaac L. Post, for $15,000, and on the same day issued a <em>fi. fa. </em>upon it, which was placed in the sheriff’s hands, and receipted by him at ten minutes past ten o’clock in the evening. By virtue .of this <em>fi. fa. </em>the boilers in question were levied upon as the property of the Messrs. Post; but Stewart &amp; Co., claiming to own them, gave bond, and the court directed this issue.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b451-6" data-blocks='[["BL_451.4",451,[137,737,1162,304]]]'>The plaintiffs claimed to own the boilers by virtue of a purchase made by them late in the afternoon of the 21st of May 1861, from Avery Frink and Isaac J. Post, acting as agents for Albert L. Post. Albert L. Post testified as to the authority which he gave to Frink and Isaac J. Post to dispose of the boilers to Stewart &amp; Co., and Frink and Isaac J.

We do not so understand the law, but say to you that [if you believe, from the evidence, that the boilers were held under a lease by plaintiffs from Post, the plaintiffs having, in this case, set up an absolute ownership, and stayed the defendants’ execution, they cannot now set up a limited interest in the property: Meyers <em>v. </em>Prentzell <em>et al., </em>9 Casey 482. Nor, if you believe the boilers were turned out as security only for the payment of damages, does it give the plaintiffs a right to recover, for in such case the defendants would have had the right to sell at sheriff’s sale, the interest of Post in the property thus placed in the plaintiffs’ hands for their security; and the purchaser at said sale the right to redeem the same upon the payment of the debt, which the property was pledged to secure.] So upon the principle ruled in Meyers <em>,v. </em>Prentzell <em>et al., if </em>you believe the boilers were delivered to the plaintiffs as security merely for the payment of damages due them, your verdict should be for the defendants, [for when absolute and exclusive property has been pleaded, as it has been in this case, it must be proved.”]</p>

The boilers were therefore clearly personal property, belonging to A. L. Post, who, according to his own testimony, had previously conveyed his life estate to his son Isaac, in the month of January or February 1861. When placed in the mill they would have been covered by the lease, but not until then. The plaintiffs in the feigned issue claimed an absolute and exclusive proprietorship of the boilers, and the court were therefore right, under the case of Meyers <em>v. </em>Prentzell, 9 Casey 482, in their charge to the jury, that they could not set up a limited <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>or restricted one, which was not the issue which they tendered, and which they undertook to prove.</p>
    <p id="b453-6" data-blocks='[["BL_453.4",453,[150,481,1161,646]]]'>The whole transaction bore evident marks of fraud. The immediate pressure of creditors, to the extent of $60,000, the entry of the judgment in favour of Wilson for $15,000, on the 21st of May, and the <em>fi. fa. </em>upon it, put into the hands of the sheriff at ten minutes past ten the same evening, whilst the hurried and uncertain contract, under which the property was claimed by the plaintiffs, was made only three hours before, and the written contract between the parties, which was to be got up by the arrangement, whatever it was, destroyed by Isaac, and its terms could only be proved by the vague recollection of witnesses, were all facts strongly tending to prove fraud. The question was fairly submitted to the jury, who found for the defendants a verdict which the court below thought to be right, and which, there being no error committed by the court on the trial, we cannot disturb, even if we were inclined to do so.</p>
