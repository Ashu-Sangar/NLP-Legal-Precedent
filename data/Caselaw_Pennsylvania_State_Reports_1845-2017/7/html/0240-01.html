      <em>Dec. </em>22. Debt against a constable and his sureties on an official bond. The bond was conditioned that Musselman, the constable, should “ execute <em>all writs and process </em>to him directed, without delay and according to law.” This bond was produced by the clerk of the sessions from among the records of the court, but there ivas no entry of the filing or approval on the bond or on the record, or of the swearing of the constable. The plaintiff showed a recovery against one Van Horn before a justice, on whose docket there was an entry of an “execution, issued January 6, 1843,” and “delivered to Musselman” by plaintiff. This writ had never been returned. The execution bore date 23d January, and the date was in the handwriting of the plaintiff in the execution, to whom it had been given by the justice. The court rejected evidence that Musselman had been removed by the court and another constable appointed in his stead on the 7th February.</p>

The constable’s official bond was found among the records of the office in its proper place; and though no entry of the approval and filing of it was shown, the presumption is that every thing was regularly done. Incalculable mischief would be done if these omissions were available. Besides, it would not be with the sureties to make them ground of objection; for the approval and filing is not to protect them, but to protect the execution-creditors. The exclusion of the defendant’s evidence of the constable’s removal within the twenty days, might, perhaps, have been erroneous, had not the sureties been fixed by the plaintiff’s recovery against the constable; but on the principle of Masser <em>v. </em>Strickland, <a href="/serg-rawl/17/0354-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="17 Serg. &amp; Rawle 354" data-case-ids="1818185" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/17/0354-01">17 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 354</a>, and other cases of the stamp, that a recovery against the constable concludes his sureties, the court was warranted in rejecting the defence.</p>
