      <em>Oct. </em>19. In 1845 the real estate of McYey was sold by the sheriff, and the question in the cause arose on the distribution of the proceeds. In 1834-5, several judgments had been obtained against McYey. In 1838 seven of these judgments, some of which had been obtained by Welty, and some by third persons to his use, were revived by an amicable <em>scire facias, </em>in which Welty was plaintiff. The agreement for the entry of the revived judgment was signed by defendant alone, and referred to the original judgments by their terms and numbers; and judgment of revival was therefore entered by confession, a "calculation of the amount being filed and referred to. This revived judgment was again included in an amicable <em>sci. fa. </em>to revive, and was referred to by its term and number; and several other original judgments being included, the whole were again revived by agreement and confession of one judgment.. Nine other similar judgments were revived by a like agreement in 1840. In 1843, five more were revived in <em>the same manner, the </em>agreement being signed by both parties.</p>

A judgment not revived by <em>scire facias </em>within five years from the' first return-day of the term to which it was entered, ceased to be a lien on the real estate of the defendant, as well against subsequent judgment creditors as against subsequent purchasers: <a href="/binn/3/0342-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="3 Binn. 342" data-case-ids="1791093" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0342-01">3 Binn. 342</a>.

This court has held that the docket entry of an amicable <em>scire facias </em>answers <em>to </em>continue the lien of a judgment: <a href="/serg-rawl/17/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="17 Serg. &amp; Rawle 123" data-case-ids="1818264" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/17/0123-01">17 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 123</a>; 1 Penna.

    <p id="b67-4" data-blocks='[["BL_67.4",67,[174,577,1189,824]]]'>But it is contended the judgments could not be legally revived by consolidation. Welty had more than thirty judgments duly entered and docketed against McYey; some of them were- in the names of other persons for his use. In the paper of amicable revival, the judgments were fully stated, and a full entry made of this amicable <em>scire facias </em>to revive the judgments so. stated in the list for the whole amount, setting it out at length, referring to the calculation filed; some of these revivals were signed by both parties, and others only signed by McYey, the defendant. It is further objected, that when McYey only signed some, it is not an agreement of the parties within the act of 1827. Welty obtained the signature of the defendant to' his amicable revival in all the cases; the object is stated to continue the lien of the judgment, and the judgments are specially referred to in the paper filed, as well as in the entry on the docket: it is an agreement within the act Of 1827. Amicable revivals generally have only the signature of the defendant.</p>
