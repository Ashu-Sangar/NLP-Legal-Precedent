Labouring under these disadvantages, they had applied to the legislature for permission to draw water from the Schuylkill, by means of steam-works, which was opposed in a memorial by the plaintiffs, claiming an exclusive right under the contract with the Navigation Company, on which the committee of the legislature-reported, it would neither be an infringment of vested rights, a breach of contract, or a disregard of prior legislative enactments; that on the 18th April, 1843, the defendants were authorized to erect works on or adjacent to the river Schuylkill, at any place between the south line of Coates street and the northern boundary <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>of the district of Spring Harden, or in such other suitable location as they may deem expedient, for the purpose of supplying their inhabitants with water from said river, or such other stream of water in the vicinity of said districts as might be found practicable, provided no more water was taken than was necessary for affording such a supply.

This last condition not having been complied with by the plaintiffs, the defendants had commenced the erection of steam-works to pump water from a place within the bounds allowed by the act of Assembly, and where the tide ebbed and ffowed-when the river was in its natural state. (This was in the pool created by the plaintiff’s dam at Fairmount.) That the daily consumption of the districts was estimated at fifteen hundred thousand gallons, and the capacity of the steam-works was thought to be twenty-five hundred thousand gallons.

It is objected, however, that the state did not grant the water of the Schuylkill river, or any portion thereof, <em>eo nomine, </em>at the Fairmount dam, to the Schuylkill Navigation Company, and, consequently, that company could pass no such right to the complainants. This objection is certainly more specious than solid. For all the water-power there is granted to the company in express terms, which indeed is not denied: but where is the water-power to be obtained from, if the water be taken out of the Fairmount dam by the defendants, excepting what may be necessary for navigation ? Is it not self-evident, that the right of the complainants to all the water-power, with which they are clearly invested, at the falls of the Schuylkill and the Fairmount dam, must thereby be rendered useless, if not real. It would, in effect, be depriving them of that to which they are justly and fairly entitled, in direct violation of all right.</p>

The former is a mere grant of the use of part of the <em>water-power; </em>and in the very ample privileges bestowed upon the company, there is a careful avoidance of a grant of the <em>corpus </em>of the water. Two distinct rights are granted, both of which would have been included in a grant of the water — the exclusive right of navigation, and the right of selling the water-power, incidentally created by the improvements for the former purpose. The rights of grantees of the latter are cautiously preserved in the event of a forfeiture by the corporation, <em>thus </em>showing a distinct understanding of the separate and distinct character of the two rights from each other, and from the ownership of the water of the river. In the grant by the company in 1824, words of larger import are used than in the prior grants; there <em>water </em>as distinct from water-power is granted, with the privilege of vending it to the adjoining districts. But the company, not owning the water under their charter, had no such right as they granted; it remained as before, common to the use of the riparian owners and citizens of the state*- There are three uses of water known to the law: drinking, washing, and the other ordinary purposes of life; 2, water-power for manufacturing purposes; <em>S, </em>navigation.

It was said the power of the legislature would not be denied; but the invalidity of the acts, if against natural right, was the substance of the argument. And because the elements are necessary to life, and water is an element, it is said to be against natural right to allow an exclusive property in it. But, though all the elements are necessary, civil society regulates by laws the common or natural rights, and among these the use of the elements. The paramount use of streams, navigable either naturally or artificially, is for highways; they are included within the same species of property, and are regulated by the same class of laws. Any infringement upon that use is a wrong. It is true, that Lord Denman, in Mason <em>v. </em>Hill, referring to the Institutes, says that running water is not the subject of private property; but Domat, in the general classification, Liv. Prelim, tit. 3, s. 1, p. 16, among those.things which are common to all, enumerates the heavens, stars, light, air, and sea; while rivers, streams, banks of rivers, highways, are classed among <em>publiece, </em>of which the sovereign regulates the use. Thiis, without hesitation, he places rivers in the same category as. highways. <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>This must be the law in.all countries. Fleta, book 3, c. 1, s. 4, in treating of the use of things which are common, omits from them <em>aqua profluens; </em>and Nicasius, lib. 2, tit. 1, 89 b, commenting on the Institutes, reads <em>aqua pluvialis </em>for <em>profluens, </em>as among the common rights; while immediately afterwards he speaks of things public, among which are included <em>flumina. </em>In the Dig., book-43, tit. 12, s. 1, is laid down the mode of distinguishing rivers; and, in s. 22, “ no man can be hindered from taking water from a public river, unless the sovereign forbids.” But public rivers are again divided into two classes, navigable and not navigable. In the latter, the right to draw water exists until forbidden; in the former, none can be taken <em>until an authority is given: </em>Tit. 13, s. 9. So, in book 2, tit. 1, there is a provision entirely inconsistent with the supposition that running water, air, and light, are in the same category. This is then a public navigable river, and, by the words of the Digest, no right exists to take the water until it is granted. In Hale de Jure, Maris, c. 3, where the rights are spoken of, it is said no one can use a ferry for livelihood, unless by prescription or grant; and, as soon as the capacity of navigating exists, the public right comes in, for then they are public highways: <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20439" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="4 Watts 439">Ibid.</a> But, whether classed as common or public, the same right exists in the sovereign to regulate the use within his dominions.</p>
    <p id="b359-4" data-blocks='[["BL_359.4",359,[137,1473,1184,773]]]'>3. That our rights are violated, cannot be doubted. The purpose for which they intend drawing water, is immaterial, nor does the act confine the use to domestic purposes, and that they do now use it for other purposes will not be denied. Would this be lawful in a private stream ? Many of them it would entirely drain; and this river was the private property of the state, and is granted to us. All the answer attempted is, you have water-power, and we are taking water only. It is difficult to understand on what it is they base their right. If on the natural right, does that extend to the water in their basin? If not, because of labour expended in getting it there ? We have also expended labour and money in making a surplus beyond the necessities of the navigation, and that is all we own. The legislature have expressly recognised this as a right in the act of 1826, s. 9, p. 304, by prohibiting the drawing of water from any pool of any navigation company without leave from the directors.</p>

They justify under the act of 1843; but that prohibits .this very work, as is apparent when its object is considered. It was intended to give a corporate capacity to construct works for supplying water to the districts. The means for doing this were to .be <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>obtained in the usual manner, that is, purchase, when vested rights were to be infringed upon. The authority to take the water of the Wissahickon, which the evidence also shows was once in contemplation, is a proof of this. That is a private stream, entirely applied to manufacturing. If taken by the districts, it would have been drained and the mills destroyed. Certainly this would not have been allowed without compensation, any more than the authority to erect a court-house would authorize the confiscation of a lot convenient for the purpose. The right to use the Schuylkill and the Wissahickon being then given by the same words, is under the same implied restriction — that private rights are not to be infringed upon unless purchased from the owners. They also deny our right, that has been given by the charter and recognised by numerous acts of Assembly: Charter Preamb., 2 Sm. 462; Act 1790, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20439" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="4 Watts 439">Ibid. 526</a>; 1818, 6 Sm. 22; 1820, 7 Sm. 272; 1828-1829, p. 44; 1831-1832, p. 55, 188. The capacity of the city to take is decided in The Mayor <em>v. </em>Elliott, <a href="/rawle/3/0170-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="3 Rawle 170" data-case-ids="1822493" data-case-paths="/rawle/3/0170-01">3 Rawle, 170</a>; and the acts of Assembly authorizing contracts with the districts are also confirmatory. They also allege the injustice of the. higher prices demanded of them. . But at whose risk are the works ? Who is to renew the dam if swept away by a flood ? The real reason is to be found in their own resolution. “The districts will make a profit.” The precise extent of the damage is, of course, immaterial, (Moore <em>v. </em>Schuylkill Navigation Co.,) since it is clearly hot nominal; but the principle involved is vastly important, being none other than the right of private property.</p>

The appellants are not included within the act, for their works are not <em>public </em>works, but the private property of their corporations. The meaning of “public works” is more important, because the right of eminent domain is limited thereby. The civil law divides property into five classes: <em>communia, publica, universitatis, nulling, </em>and <em>singulorum. </em>In the <a id="p361" href="#p361" data-label="361" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*361</a>first are included the sea, air, and light, for all may use them, subject to laws of the particular countries. <em>Publica </em>includes property of which the dominion is in the state for the use of <em>all </em>the people of the state, subject to laws in like manner. <em>Universitatis </em>or a corporation, includes all bodies of men less than a state and greater than a family. Things <em>universitatis </em>are those of which all the <em>community, </em>or members of the corporation, have the use, as baths, race-courses, <em>curien: </em>Heinec. on Inst., book 2, tit. 1, s. 15. These purposes are not such for which private property may be taken by the right of eminent domain. That is defined in Prelec. Puffend. to be the power of the state which authorizes private property to be used so often as <em>public </em>necessity requires. Works similar to these of the appellants were enjoined by Kent, Ch., in Gardner <em>v. </em>Newburg, 2 Johns. C. R. 162, while the right to take for <em>public </em>uses was not denied. The subject is further considered in 2 Kent’s Com. 339; Grot, book 1, c. 1, s. 6; Puffend. book 8, c. 5, s.i 7. Otherwise every borough might confiscate private property for its own use. The question then comes down to this: Is there such a thing as private property, and are men to be protected under their grants ?</p>

The incapacity to grant the water, to the exclusion of the use by the people, lies at the bottom of all natural and indefeasible rights springing from physical necessity, which is superior to all improvements, comforts, or conveniences. This has never been denied but in barbarous countries. But these natural rights springing from necessity are always protected where man as an individual is regarded, and can only be forfeited by crime. This <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>incapacity of alienation by the state of these common x-ights is expressly recognised by a learned judge in 1 Halst. 76, the legal title and usufruct being vested in the people of the state. Among these common rights, are placed <em>flowing ivater </em>that men may drink: Instit. book 2, tit. 1, s. 1; Grot, book, c. 2, s. 12; so in Puff, book 4, c. 5, s. 2, running water remains in common; and by Yattel, book’l, c. 20, p. 101, 110, it is classed among those things which, in their own nature, cannot be possessed. So in Browne’s Civil Law, book 2, c. 1, p. 170; Brae, book 2, fol. 7, and Yinnius, 140, 141,142, it is declared that the use of the water of rivers for washing, drinking and for cattle, is common for the use of all, and of natural right. The difference of regal and public rights are indifferent here, for both are, as said in <a href="/citations/?q=26%20Wend.%20413" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="26 Wend. 413">26 Wend. 413</a>, vested in the same power, and for what ? To be destroyed ? No, but to effectuate the right. The very next sentence of Fleta, following the one cited on the other side, ranks among these common rights the right of using streams and harbours. Not an authority but shows this power of the state has always been exercised to promote this general right of the citizens, never to diminish it. Would the grant of the exclusive navigation of the Susquehanna to one individual be tolerated, or the exclusive right of drinking from the Schuylkill, if given to but one family of the town ? Yet to such length must the argument be carried if it be sound.</p>
    <p id="b362-3" data-blocks='[["BL_362.4",362,[303,1541,1175,676]]]'>2. The legislature have not granted the exclusive right. Prior to 1815, the city supplied itself with water under the common right. The water-power was then purchased; but the distinction between water and water-power is settled by the undisputed rule that the owner of a water-power in a private stream cannot divert the water from the channel, unless he returns it on his own land. This common right was recognised in the acts of 1761, 1 Sm. 235; 1773, Ibid. 410; 1781, Ibid. 515; 1784, 2 Sm. 90; and the acts of 1843, 1844, are legislative constructions of the act of 1815. The habits and usages of the people show this, and they are good grounds of construction of a statute: Martin <em>v. </em>Waddell, 16 Peters, 367. The claim set up would deprive every inhabitant along the river from drawing a cup of water from the stream, since by so much is the water-power diminished.</p>

Instead of depending on general or constitutional law, the question before us depends on the interpretation of a short and isolated section of a statute; but the quotations from the civilians and from Lord Hale bear strongly upon it. They establish that the use of water, flowing in its natural channel, like the use of heat, light, or air, has been held by every civilized nation, from the earliest times, to be common' by the law of nature, and not merely public, like the use of a river or a port, which is subject to municipal regulation by the law of the place. They establish, also, that the domestic uses of water are its natural and primary ones. Air is not more indispensable to the support of animal or vegetable life. Water is borne by the air, in the form of vapour, to the remotest regions of the earth, for the free use and common refreshment of mankind; and to interdict the use of the one within any particular locality, would be as monstrous and subversive of the scheme of animal existence, as it would be to interdict the use of the other. It is only when it has been received on the surface of the earth, not while it is falling from the clouds, that it can be made to minister to the ordinary wants of life; and if it be common at first, it must continue to be so while it is returning, by its natural channels, to the ocean. No one, therefore, can have an exclusive right to the aggregated drops that compose the masses thus flowing, without-contravening one of the most peremptory laws of nature. Water may be exclusively appropriated by being separated from the mass of the stream, and confined in tanks or trunks; but then it would have ceased to be <em>aqua profluens. </em>It does not cease to be so, however, by being merely impeded in its natural channel by a dam. That a law of nature may be displaced by even legislative mighty has been stoutly denied by'high authority, though perhaps without Conclusive effect where the question is one of power and not of right; but where a.court has to deal with a question of construction and not of power, the protection of such a right from violation <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>by superior force, must always turn tbe scale. Nothing but the most clear and imperative expression of the legislative will could prevent it. What we have to do, then, is to see whether the legislature has undisputably debarred all mankind from drawing water from the Schuylkill river, except by permission of the Schuylkill Navigation Company, or the city of Philadelphia, its alienee.</p>
    <p id="b364-3" data-blocks='[["BL_364.4",364,[306,688,1188,1452]]]'>The city claims, not immediately by grant from the Commonwealth, but by conveyance from the company, which can pass no more than the company had power to give. The fifteenth section of the act of incorporation provides, that “the said president, managers and company, shall have the privilege, and be entitled to use, the water-power from the said river, sluices, or canals, to propel such machinery as they may think proper to erect on the land, which they may previously have purchased from the owner or owners ; or may sell in fee-simple, lease, or rent, for one or more years, the said water-power, to any person or persons, to be used in such manner and on such terms as they may think proper with condition that the consequences of the grant shall not at any time impede the navigation. Nothing contained in any subsequent enactment touches the subject of water-power, except a proviso subjoined to the twenty-fifth section of the same act, which declares “ that in case of forfeiture by the company, the owners of water-power created by any dam erected by virtue of this act, s.hall be obliged to keep in perfect repair and good condition, any dams, slopes, or locks, connected with such water-power, under and subject to the same conditions and penalties as the company originally' were; and shall have a right to charge and receive the same tolls as the company are authorized to receive by this act: and in case the owner or owners of such water-power shall neglect or refuse to keep such dams, slopes, or locks, as aforesaid, in good repair, fit for the passage of boats, arks, and rafts, as the case may be, the legislature may resume all the rights, privileges, liberties, and franchises granted by this act.” I have extracted the proviso entire, not only to present all the legislation on the subject to the eye at once, but to show that the question before us depends exclusively on the fifteenth section.</p>
    <p id="b364-4" data-blocks='[["BL_364.5",364,[311,2157,1174,290]],["BL_365.1",365,[109,386,1215,2072]],["BL_366.1",366,[303,479,1189,2062]],["BL_367.1",367,[122,414,1182,829]]]'>Now, a grant of water-power is not a grant of the water for any thing else than the propulsion of machinery; and it consequently does not exclude the use of it by any one else, in a way which does not injure or decrease the power. It is not a grant of property in the <em>corpus </em>of the water as a chattel; and this does not seem to have been doubted by the judge who decided the cause below. A right <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>may doubtless be granted, if a grant were necessary, to intercept running water, and confine it in reservoirs for separate use; but' the grant of such a right would not be the grant of a water-power. No two things can be more distinct and dissimilar. The respond ents, therefore, would not be answerable in equity for taking the free and running water of the river, or for any thing less than a nuisance to the complainants by decreasing the volume and force of the current; for on no other ground could the extraordinary' jurisdiction of a chancellor, which in cases of nuisance is only the handmaid and protectress of the legal title, be invoked to restrain the diverting of a water-course. The authorities to the point are collected in Eden on Injunctions, c. 11, p. 157, in which it is shown that, though it is the practice to enjoin in clear cases of nuisance,' without a trial to establish the right at law, yet the courts of equity-are exceedingly unwilling to do so; and my first impression was that <em>the </em>injunction ought to have been refused on that ground. But granting for the occasion that the bill, answer, and proofs, establish the existence of an actual nuisance, yet, as injunctions, without exception, are discretionary and grantable on the circumstances of the [particular case, I am far from clear that it would not be our duty, to leave the complainants to their remedy at law, until they could make out a case of substantial and appreciable injury to a part of their water-power, which they otherwise would have put in use: and no such injury is made out by the proofs.' The estimates are that about two millions of gallons are daily taken by the respondents from the pool, while from one hundred and fifty to five hundred millions are suffered, in the same time, to tumble over the dam. Whatever, therefore, may be the growth of the districts and their wants, it is pretty certain -that the complainants' will be free from actual damage from the respondents’ works, in all time to come. The number of the population at present is computed to be one hundred thousand; and should it in' time be equal to the population of London and its environs — a1 thing that is barely within the bounds of possibility — the daily consumption, according to the present ratio, would be no more than forty -millions of gallons; leaving an immense surplus, which the complainants do not, and probably never can, use : but should the case turn out in process of time to be otherwise, it would be time" enough to apply the strong arm of a chancellor to it. But according to Pastorius <em>v. </em>Fisher, <a href="/rawle/1/0027-01" class="citation" data-index="31" data-cite="1 Rawle 27" data-case-ids="1819358" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0027-01">1 Rawle, 27</a>, a plaintiff is entitled to nominal damages from one who floods his land without actual damage, because every invasion of a right is, in contemplation of <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>law, a constructive damage, calling for compensation in proportion, to its importance. We must not forget, however, that an action is of right, and that an injunction is of grace. Viewing the case as if the complainants had established their right by a verdict at law, it would not follow that a subsequent jury, performing the office of a chancellor under our mixed system, as necessity has sometimes compelled them to do, would be bound on the principle of Clyde <em>v. </em>Clyde, <a href="/yeates/1/0092-01" class="citation" data-index="32" data-cite="1 Yeates 92" data-case-ids="6771954" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0092-01">1 Yeates, 92</a>, to coerce the respondents, by means of vindicatory damages, to abate their works; and if a jury would not do so, a chancellor would not enjoin them. It is true that in an action to compensate a benefit, the value of it to the receiver is the measure of the damages ; but when the action is for a wrong, the measure is compensation to the extent of the loss. But no speculative benefit or loss is a subject of compensation; and even if it were, yet where damages will compensate either the benefit derived, or the loss suffered, from a nuisance, equity will not interfere. Here the complainants might recover full compensation, by a verdict for the one or the other, inasmuch as the works above do not practically interfere with their comfort or convenience. We must admit that a man who has paid for a water-power is not bound to use the whole, or any part of it, but that he may choose to let the water escape, as the complainants did, without giving any one a right to interfere with it; but would not non-user be a matter to go to a jury, in mitigation of damages ? Except to establish the right, a jury is not at liberty to go beyond the actual loss; and this principle is peculiarly applicable to the course of a chancellor. I have found no case in point for diverting water-courses; but conclusive analogies may be drawn from cases of nuisance, by stopping ancient lights. In the Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Nichol, 16 Ves. 338, it was held that equity will not interfere where the injury can be compensated by damages; but that it will restrain an injury which would probably drive the complainants from the premises. No fear of that, from any injury done to the complainants before us. Lord Eldon said that the foundation of equitable jurisdiction to interfere by injunction in cases of nuisance, is that head of mischief alluded to by Lord Hardwicke, in The Fishmongers’ Company <em>v. </em>The East India Company, 1 Dickens, 164, as that sort of <em>material </em>injury to the comfort of the existence of those who dwell in the neighbouring house; that the diminution of the value of the premises, is not a ground to interfere; a.nd that equity will not interfere upon every degree of darkening ancient lights. And in the kindred case of Lord Ripon <em>v, </em>Hobart, 3 Myln. &amp; K. 169. Lord Brougham re<a id="p367" href="#p367" data-label="367" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*367</a>fused an injunction to prevent a contingent nuisance, saying that « if the thing sought to he prohibited is in itself a nuisance, the court will interfere to stay <em>irreparable </em>mischief, without waiting for the result of a trial; and will, according to circumstances, direct an issue or allow an action; or, if need be, expedite the proceedings, the injunction being in the mean time continued. But where the thing sought to be restrained is not unavoidably in itself noxious, but something which may, according to circumstances, prove so, the court will not interfere. So in Wynstanley <em>v. </em>Lee, 2 Swanst. 333, Sir Thomas Plumer refused an injunction to restrain the erection of a building which darkened ancient lights, because it did not appear that it would materially interfere with the comfort of the complainant. I do not, however, insist on this aspect of the case, because it is not one in which it was viewed at the argument, or one which has attracted the attention or elicited the opinion of my brethren; and emphatically because there is another ground on which we all agree that the decision may be securely rested.</p>
    <p id="b367-4" data-blocks='[["BL_367.4",367,[120,1250,1183,1220]],["BL_368.1",368,[316,415,1187,1353]]]'>The preceding remarks have been hazarded on the foot of a momentary concession that the respondents’ works are a nuisance in contemplation of law; but are they so ? The affirmative must be rested on an assumption that any abstraction of the water for domestic purposes is a technical injury to the complainants’ waterpower ; and this, whether it were drawn from the pool or from the stream above; for the volume of the water would be equally lessened by it in either case. According to the argument, it would be an infringement of the company’s right, to draw water from the river even above the charter-ground. But is it possible to think, that in granting the company authority to use or sell the power of the surplus water, the legislature intended to appropriate the whole stream, for every purpose, to its exclusive use, and to debar the inhabitants of the contiguous villages and farms from using any part of it for drinking, cooking, washing, or any other domestic purpose ? It would be monstrous to suppose it. The very extravagance of the pretension is an irresistible argument against it. The intent of the legislature was to give the company a monopoly of the power incidentally created by its works, and to give it no more; for the words of the section go no further. The water in its pools was not to be drawn from them for application to machinery elsewhere without its consent; for that is the extent of the enactment, and it contains no express or implied prohibition of any other use of it. The river above tho charter-ground was left subject to the common law, which allows every riparian owner to divert <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>'the stream for purposes of irrigation or power, subject only to return the residue of it to its natural channel on his own ground; yet even he would be liable, on the principle of the argument, for the least imaginable diminution or consumption of it. Even, within the extent of the charter-ground, there was to be no sacrifice of natural and inherent rights to the merely collateral creation of water-power, which was not the object for which the company was incorporated, but merely auxiliary to it. The legislature would not have ventured to abridge a right so sacred to accomplish a subordinate purpose, however meritorious; and had the' interpretation attempted been propounded to it as necessary and inevitable, the bill would certainly have been rejected. What, then, have the respondents done? The inhabitants of the districts might have lawfully dipped from the margin of the pool, water enough for their several necessities; but instead of drawing it by hand or by horses, they have combined their funds to produce a cheaper and a better transportation. True, they have laid pipes in the pool, as they might have laid them in the bed of the river, had not the dam been erecte4; but what has that to do with the supposed production of an injury to the complainants by decreasing the volume and power of the stream ? Certainly no more than the transportation of the' water, when separated from the mass, has to do with it. Unless the complainants have a specific property in the wat§r itself — and all the writers on natural or conventional law agree that they have not — they have no equity. To state their case is to decide it. We are therefore compelled to differ from the opinion, expressed by our late brother Kennedy, and to reverse his decree.</p>
