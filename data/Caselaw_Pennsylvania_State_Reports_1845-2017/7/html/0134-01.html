Barnes as executor of Scott, and David Scott, sealed an agreement as follows: “Whereas David Scott has claims <em>against </em>his father’s estate <em>for moneys paid for him, </em>for <em>labour done, </em>for <em>property sold </em>to him, &amp;c.

They introduce the submission by reciting that “David Scott has claims against his father’s estate,” without saying a.word about counter-claims ; and proceed by.saying, that, being desirous of “ closing the <em>matter </em>with as little hard feeling and expense as possible, they hereby agree to refer all matters in controversy” to arbitrators. What matter? Expressly the matter of the son’s claim, and no other. Had it been pretended that the executor had a cross-demand, it would surely have been inserted as distinct matter of adjudication. By the terms of the submission, therefore, it appears that the matters in controversy were understood to <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>be the claims of the son, and the award is consequently broader than the submission.
