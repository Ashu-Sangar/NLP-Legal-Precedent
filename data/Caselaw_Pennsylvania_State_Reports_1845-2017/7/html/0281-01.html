By the bill of particulars, the claim was stated-to be for certain overcharges made by the defendants as consignees of certain goods at Vera Cruz, one item of which was the difference between the amount paid for duties, and that charged — the payment having been made in depreciated paper, called <em>vales. </em>The other items were for overcharges in expenses, commissions, &amp;e.</p>

It appeared that Curcier, before the shipment, was aware of the existing practice to pay a certain proportion of the duties in such paper.</p>

There was evidence that forty per cent, of these duties were received in vales, or paper money issued by the Mexican Government, and that they were selling at a large discount at the time of the alleged payment.

Curcier subsequently made objections, stating he had an agreement with defendants to be allowed the benefit of the savings in duties, and also that certain of the charges for commissions should be less than were stated in the account.

It is certain that the mere rendering of an account does not make it an account <em>stated; </em>nor will that effect be produced by the cessation of dealings between the parties. On the other hand, it is equally certain, that to make an account stated, it need not be signed by the parties. The true rule appears to be, that an account rendered, with a balance struck, and that assented to by the party to whom it is rendered, is an account stated.</p>

Such assent need not be expressed in words; it may be implied from the conduct of the party. It is the settled law merchant— indeed one of the settled landmarks of the law — that an account rendered is allowed, if it is not objected to without unnecessary delay. The time within which objection must be made cannot be definitely fixed. It depends upon the circumstances of the case, whether an acquiescence or a presumed agreement to the correctness of the account exists. If -it does, and the party does not account for his silence, the account is considered as settled to his satisfaction. The reason for this rule is the same as for that which requires immediate notice to be given to the parties to a bill or note of its dishonour, and other rules of a similar character, which are to be found in the commercial codes of all civilized nations.. Punctuality is the very life of commerce ; and it is more important to the merchant than to any one else, to be immediately apprised of every thing which affects his pecuniary condition. He regulates his enterprises accordingly; and dealing upon the assurance of ascertained gains, he engages in speculations which he otherwise would not. There is most excellent reason, therefore, in the law which requires that notice should be given, within a reasonable time, of objections, if any exist, to an account rendered.</p>

But his assent may be presumed from his acts as well as his silence; and if he acknowledges the receipt of the account, communicates with the other party on the subject of the mode of remitting the balance, and receives that remittance without any objection, it is in law an assent to the account. If he had signed the account, or said to his correspondent, “ I have ex<a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>amined and found it correct,” it would have been a stated account. Would either of these acts be any stronger than that which has been done here ? You must not mistake; such account is not conclusive. There are cases in which it may be opened; cases of plain mistake, cases of fraud, or where the party was ignorant of some material fact. But then the burden of proof is on the party who objects to the account. It is <em>prima facie </em>correct, and he must bring his action within six years. If, for example, in this case, the plaintiffs had not known (which, however, cannot be alleged here) that the duties to the Mexican government upon the importation of merchandise, were either in whole or in part payable in a depreciated currency, they doubtless might at any time within a reasonable period after the discovery of the fact, raise that objection. But where the objections made are all palpable upon the face of the account, and ought and must have occurred to the mind when it first met the' eye, no unreasonable delay in immediately communicating them can be tolerated.</p>

Rejoinder, not merchants’ accounts; and on this, issue was joined. The principal issue on which the cause was tried, and to which the charge was directed, was merchants’ accounts. In the charge we perceive nothing wrong. The objection on which reliance is placed, is that <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>the account-sales was not transmitted to Curcier; hut to this allegation the answer is altogether satisfactory. Bevan and Humphreys were the legal proprietors of the consignment, and, so far as concerns the interest of Curcier, were his authorized agents. Curcier had but a contingent interest in the shipment, being entitled to the proceeds, if any, after paying Bevan and Humphreys the full amount of their advancement. By the well-settled principle of law and commercial usage, the account of sales is forwarded to the legal owner of the goods; the consignee is not bound to notice the equitable or contingent owner. The presumption is, that the former advises the latter of the state and condition of the consignment, and if he be prejudiced by his neglect, the remedy is against him. Curcier, Bevan, and Humphreys are identical, so far as regards themselves, and the correspondence furnishes evidence that of this the parties were fully aware. Their acts and omissions are his. The court on that was right in instructing the jury the account was closed, not an open or unsettled account, and consequently the plaintiff could not avail himself of the exception in the statute. The suit is brought in the names of Bevan and Humphreys, and could not be brought otherwise, not for the benefit of Curcier, but of Mr. Frevall, whose interest does not appear.</p>

But the answer is, that the only issue is merchants’ accounts; that if the plaintiffs intended to rely on these allegations, they should have been specially replied. That in order to prevent the operation of the act of limitations, there must be a special replication, is <em>ruled </em>in Clark <em>v. </em>Hougham, 2 Barn. &amp; Cress. 149, (9 E. C. L. R.;) 3 P.

That the defendants were beyond seas must be specially alleged, is also plain. As the pleadings now stand, the defendant has had no opportunity of contesting the fact that the parties, or one of them, had returned. It cannot be permitted that the cause should be tried on one issue in the lower court, and on a different issue in this court. The charge of the court is so full on the principal question, that I do not deem it necessary to repeat that which has been there well said.</p>
