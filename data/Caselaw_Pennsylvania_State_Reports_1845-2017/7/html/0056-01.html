      <em>Oct. </em>16. The two questions argued on this appeal were, -whether the accountant was entitled to a credit for the depreciation of certain stocks, and whether he was entitled to compensation as guardian. The case, as presented on the paper book, was as follows: John Denniston died in 1829, leaving eight children. In 1880, James McCahan, his administrator, filed his account, charging himself with a balance of $19,141, and died, having appointed John McCahan his executor. Among the items of charge in this account, were forty shares United States Bank stock, $4000; one hundred and twenty shares Harrisburg Bank, $3000 ; twenty shares Pittsburgh Bank, $1000. To this amount was appended a note, “ The two first of these stocks are at a considerable premium, and the last at a low premium; but the accountant charges himself with the original value, as he is ready to transfer the stock to any guardian of the junior children, and holds the stock for tbe benefit of the estate.” John, as executor of James, filed a final account of the estate of Denniston on the 7th August, 1838, charging himself with the balance of the first account as cash. This account showed a balance of $28,374, and was confirmed by the court.. Until the 28th June, 1838, there had been no guardian appointed for the minor children of Denniston; but on that day, James A. McCahan, (the present accountant,) a son of John McCahan, was appointed guardian of the four younger children, John having previously acted as administrator of Denniston and guardian of the children, and having paid large sums of money on their account, under direction of the Orphans’ Court. In the present account James A., the guardian, claimed a credit for the $4000 in United States Bank stock, “ originally purchased by Denniston,'and transferred as a fund for the support of the minor children by his representatives.”</p>

All right to them at that moment vested in the administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>who succeeded him, and could and ought to have sued for their possession: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Strohecker, <a href="/watts/9/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Watts 479" data-case-ids="1849961" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0479-01">9 Watts, 479</a>; Drenkle <em>v. </em>Sharman, <a href="/watts/9/0495-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Watts 495" data-case-ids="1849984" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0495-01">9 Watts, 495</a>; Kendall <em>v. </em>Lee, 2 Penna.

His transaction with the bank, then, even if made with the intention of vesting the ownership in himself, amounts to nothing. The same rule applies to the receipt given by appellant to John McCahan for the stocks in question. He, having no power over them, clearly had no right to transfer them to the guardian; and even if the latter had actually received them, the transaction would have been void. But the evidence shows that no part of the stocks in question actually came into his hands. The receipt given had not, and was not intended to have any operation upon the title to the property.
