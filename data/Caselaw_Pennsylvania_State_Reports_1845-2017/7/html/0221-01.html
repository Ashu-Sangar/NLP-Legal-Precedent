      <em>Dec. </em>16. This was an action of trespass for entering the close of defendant, breaking and carrying away the soil. The defendant pleaded that he had the right to dam the water of a creek back upon plaintiff’s land to a certain line, and to have and enjoy a dam upon plaintiff’s land for the purposes of his mill, <em>and at all reasonable and proper times to enter upon and clean out said dam ; </em>that it had become filled up by the carelessness of the former owner and plaintiff, and by the illegal conduct of plaintiff in diverting a stream formerly running into defendant’s own dam on his land, whereby the upper dam had become filled up; that in consequence of such filling up defendant entered and cleansed it and put a new trunk in the dam, doing as little damage as possible.</p>

There was no express reservation of a right of entry to cleanse or repair. He then proved that the upper dam had become filled up by the deposit of the creek, owing to the nonuser of the mill, and neglect of the gate in the dam; and that he entered and dug it out, depositing the earth on the bank on his own land. The defendant having shown that plaintiff had opened a small ditch into the upper dam, plaintiff proposed asking the witness who had said “he had acted for a former owner of the defendant’s land,” whether he had given plaintiff leave to make that ditch, but the court rejected the evidence.</p>
