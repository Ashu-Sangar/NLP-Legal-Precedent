      <em>Nov. </em>2. The defendant appealed from a judgment of a justice in trover. The cause was arbitrated, under a rule of court, and in August, 1845, an award for defendant. A recognisance was then entered into by One Stemm, conditioned, in the event of a judgment for defendant, that plaintiff would pay all costs, «with. <a id="p126" href="#p126" data-label="126" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*126</a>one dollar for each and every day that shall be lost by said defendant in attending to such appeal.” The cause was again arbitrated, by agreement, and award for defendant.</p>

The latter section provides that in lieu of the bail theretofore required on appeals from judgments of justices and awards of arbitrators, the bail shall be absolute in double the probable amount of costs, accrued or likely to accrue, with one or more sureties, “ conditioned for the payment of all costs, accrued, or that may be legally recovered in such cases against the appellants.” Not a word in this about payment of a daily allowance for prosecuting or defending the suit. ' In order to obtain his appeal, the plaintiff was driven to harder terms than the law allowed to be exacted, and the recognisance was void.</p>
