      <em>Jan. </em>28, 31. In Oct. 1839, Curtis made a general assignment to Winebrener in trust to sell and pay creditors. Among the property assigned, was certain real estate appraised at $1000, subject to a mortgage to Sulger of $7000, and a second one to Miller of $3000. On the first of these there were arrears of interest $1800, and on the last $684, at the time of the sale. In Sept. 1840, the property was offered for sale at auction by the assignee, under advertisement that it would be sold clear of all encumbrances. At that sale Miller bid $11,250 ; but it was knocked down to Lawrence, who was the agent of Winebrener, at $11,250. It was found by the jury, on a feigned issue directed, that Lawrence purchased for Winebrener, and that he abandoned the purchase because of an alleged loss of some of the title-papers, of which, however, there was no proof, and because Miller declined releasing the difference between the amount due on his mortgage and the amount of the bid. Miller held the guaranty of Robb and South for his mortgage, and, fifteen months after the abandonment of the sale by Lawrence, of which he had notice, and which sale he did not attempt to enforce, proceeded against the property on his <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>mortgage, and sold it by the sheriff. The proceeds proving sufficient to pay the first mortgage only, Miller received from Robb and South $3000, the amount due to him on the mortgage as principal, and assigned them his claim.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b334-3" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[300,581,1166,92]]]'>Winebrener had been surety for Curtis on several judgments, which he paid and claimed to be subrogated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b334-4" data-blocks='[["BL_334.5",334,[296,679,1172,423]]]'>The court directed that he should be charged with the amount of his bid by his agent, Lawrence, as if he had complied with the purchase, with interest, to the filing of the auditor’s report. From this was deducted his commission, and the amount due on the two mortgages, which, as found on a feigned issue, was less than the amount of Winebrener’s bid, with interest added; the amounts due on the judgments paid by the assignee as surety, which had been a lien on the land, were also deducted, so far as the amount of his bid would reach.</p>

[Rogers, J. — If that question is open, do not the facts show an intent to become a purchaser ?] The assignee might have said he could not sell for less than the encumbrances, and his advertisement was equivalent to that, especially as it was his duty not to permit it to go at less than the appraised value: Bramley <em>v. </em>Alt, 3 Ves. 627.
