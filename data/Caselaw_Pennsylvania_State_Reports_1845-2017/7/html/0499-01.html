Four years afterwards, in 1842, another creditor filed a petition to the same effect, averring both assignments to be void, and also averring the receipt of the dividends by Weber and McKean, as releasing creditors. The trustees, in their answer, averred that proceedings had been instituted to set aside the assignment, but the judgment of the Supreme Court had been adverse to the attempt.

In the rejoinder filed in October, 1848, the trustees averred they had brought suit to assert their rights, on account of any infirmity in the assignments, if any such existed, and that they had no interest in the March assignment, which could induce them to neglect their duty, nor had they any funds to carry on the suit, which was unnecessary, as suits by two creditors on their own account had been commenced ; but that the petitioner might, if he chose, have carried on this suit, it being for the benefit of all the creditors. On the 10th of February, 1844, this petition was dismissed. On the 17th, a petition by another creditor was filed for the same purpose, and alleging that no steps had been taken to avoid either of the assignments, and that in their suit, (the present one,) pretended to have been brought to test the validity of the Jime assignment, no steps had been taken to indicate their intention, and that in a proceeding for distribution, they had, so far as they could, ratified the same. After answer and replication, the matter was referred to an auditor, to report whether by neglect, &amp;c., the trustees had rendered themselves liable, or had any funds. On his report, filed in 1847, the petition was dismissed; whereupon Weber and McKean were, on their own petition, dismissed from the office of insolvent trustees, and Miller, the present plaintiff, substituted as trustee.</p>

But although this must be admitted, yet it is said it is not within its spirit, because the property assigned was actually situated in the state of New York, and that Phillips and Son, the preferred creditors, did not reside here, but in London. Now, admitting the facts to be as stated, as to all the assigned property, yet the actual <em>situs </em>of personal property makes no difference in the obligation to record the deed at the place of residence of the assignor. The law impérativoly requires it should be recorded here as notice to all creditors claiming <em>dehors </em>the assignment, some of whom at least reside here. We must not endeavour to fritter away the plain words of an act by fanciful and nice distinctions, or supposed inconveniences, which may result from the law.

The' time is not far distant* when the rule, firmly settled in the cases cited, will command the universal commendation of every professional man, of every disinterested and unprejudiced citizen, without exception. Indeed, I do not understand the principle there ruled to be disputed, but it is contended this case differs from those in an essential particular. It is said this is an assignment of <em>all </em>the partnership effects for the benefit of partnership creditors, and that it only stipulates for a release of the joint, and not the separate estate of the parties. But the answer to this suggestion, an answer I believe to be sound, is, that the deed does not purport to convey all the partnership property, but a part of the real property only, particularly mentioned, belonging to the partnership; and, secondly, that the release of the debts against the firm is necessarily a release of the separate property. I am at a loss to understand how, after a release of a partnership debt which necessarily extinguishes the debt, the creditor could proceed against separate property of the assignors, Moss and Phillips. No insolvent debtor has a right to coerce his creditor to execute a release, except he convey all his property, joint and separate. This is the just and honest, principle settled in the cases cited, and I cannot perceive that this case forms an exception. On my conscience, I believe no honest, conscientious man would wish the law otherwise than it has been settled by repeated adjudications. When an unfortunate debtor surrenders all his estate, let him be discharged. Until he assigns all his property, creditors may, but in the name of common honesty, let them not be compelled to release him. Therefore, the deed of the 22d June is also void.</p>

They however afterwards accepted the trust, and gave bonds for its faithful .execution. Why they did accept, connecting it, as we must do, with their subsequent conduct and interest they have in supporting the assignment, it is not difficult to imagine. Their motive is apparent. They were preferred creditors to a large amount, and consequently occupied an antagonistic position to their duties as trustees. The sureties had a direct and immediate interest in supporting the assignment. Notwithstanding they knew the assignment was attacked at all points, (and the defendants knew it also,) the assignees paid, and they received large sums of money in payment of their respective preferred debts; nay, more, the bail in the bond stands in precisely the same predicament. It appears in evidence that an application was made to dismiss these faithless trustees. It was strenuously, and unfortunately successfully, resisted; and why resisted, is not a matter of surmise. The reason why the Court of Common Pleas refused to dismiss them we are not informed, as unfortunately the opinion of the court is not before us, and we know not the ground on which they based their decree. Had the facts which afterwards appeared been known at the time, I am inclined to think no court ever would have appointed them, and I must be permitted to express my regret that the court refused the application of the creditors. Weber and McKean ought not to have desired to retain the situation as trustees, in the peculiar position in which they were placed, particularly after the other creditors desired them to resign the trust. To hold, therefore, that the acts of these trustees, under such a state of facts, is a ratification of a voidable deed, would in my judgment be a disgrace to the law. It would be allowing any palpable, wilful breach of trust by interested trustees to destroy the rights of creditors, not only without, but contrary to their consent, in a matter well known and understood both by trustees and assignees.</p>

Not as trustees, but in payment of their respective debts as preferred creditors, in opposition to and contrary to their duties in a representative character. They seem to have forgotten that they were trustees.

The assignees, if they had so chosen, might have paid the money over to the trustees, and taken an indemnity, or they might have protected themselves by alleging that they were stakeholders only, and, as such, were not bound to pay over the money until the right was determined. But this, it appears, was not done, for reasons best known to themselves. They chose to pay over to the preferred creditors; whether with or without indemnity, we know not, nor is it material. Nor is it of any sort of consequence whether they acted with or without the advice of counsel. It was paid at their own risk; and if improperly paid, innocent creditors are not to be injured by their mistakes or misapprehension of the law.

But the suit we are now trying is an adversary proceeding within the meaning of the decision in Okie’s Appeal. This suit, you will recollect, was brought on the 29th September, 1888, by the trustees of Phillips and Moss, insolvent debtors. It is an adversary proceeding, the only object of which was to recover money in the hands of the assignees, on the allegation that the assignments were illegal, with the view of distributing it among the general creditors, and preventing its application, or rather misapplication, to certain preferred creditors under the assignments. The trustees, you will observe, are the representatives of the creditors. In them, by the assignment, vests all the property of the insolvent. They can proceed in no other way than by suit. The doctrine that creditors who wish to test the validity of an assignment must do so by judgment, attachment or execution, only applies when there is no assignment to trustees for the benefit óf <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>all.

I see great negligence, and perhaps something worse on the part of the trustees, but nothing which would justify you in coming to the conclusion that the suit was abandoned. No declaration, it is true, was filed; but had the defendants been so disposed, they might have required the plaintiff to file his declaration, and to give a bill of particulars — an accurate statement of the extent and nature of his demand. Instead of pursuing this course, the then counsel for the defendants chooses to issue a circular letter, in which he notices only the assignment of the 22d June, 1837. If ignorant as to the’ object of the suit, which is difficult to believe after the repeated attachments of the property, the bills in chancery, the bill of interpleader, which have been given in evidence, they could have informed themselves in the mode already pointed out, or by an application to the trustees, who would doubtless have informed them of the object and nature of the suit, and that the design was to recover all the property, of whatever description, in their hands, and to distribute it among the general creditors of Moss and Phillips. The assignees, it is not denied, were aware that the creditors were attacking the validity of the assignments; there was, therefore, suificient to put them on inquiry as to the nature of the suit brought by the trustees, a suit sufficiently comprehensive to embrace both thé assignments. They ought to have known that they could not safely pay over the money to the preferred creditors until the validity of the assignments was properly tested. They might have protected themselves if they had desired to do so, but if they preferred to act on erroneous advice, as their own, on them be the loss, let it not fall on the heads of innocent creditors who have been pursuing their rights with untiring diligence.</p>

If that be the fact, of which you will judge, it is a defence on the first assignment. But it will be for you to inquire whether they knew it, or had sufficient to put them on inquiry. The suit of the 29th September, 1838, as has been before observed, was sufficiently broad to cover both assignments. Had they called on the trustees in the proper way, for a-bill of particulars, would they have been informed that the suit was intended to recover all the money, of whatever kind or description, that was in their hands- belonging to the estate of Moss and Phillips, as well under the first as under the second assignment.

If the latter be the case, the defendants must look for indemnity to Phillips and Son. They cannot prefer them at the expense of others. I repeat to you that this is not a question of fraud; they had the right to pay the creditors under the assignment, but if Phillips and Son had no right to receive the money, it must be again paid to those who have. You will observe that the non-recording the deed in this state was the fault of the assignors and assignees. And if by not recording the deed the creditors remained ignorant of it, it shows the policy of the law in requiring it to be recorded in the state, and thereby giving notice to the creditors here of the situation of Moss and Phillips, who were their debtors. As there are none so blind as those who will not see, so none are so ignorant as those who will not inquire. If, therefore, you should believe that the defendants would neither see nor inquire, it will be for you seriously to consider whether it would be just that the loss, if any, should fall on those who are innocent, and have prosecuted their rights with due and proper diligence.

That is no bar; he may proceed against either or both. What effect a judgment and satisfaction in this suit may have, it is premature to decide. That question will properly arise in the trial of the suit against Weber and McKean. It cannot be tried here.

The argument in Thomas <em>v. </em>Moss, at this term, contains all that need be said as to the June assignment. As to the March assignment, the question is simply whether the deed is voidable under the act of 1818, though all the property assigned was out of the state, and the beneficiaries were foreigners. All fraud in this, as in the whole case, is negatived by the charge, and so was any dispute as to the locality of the property. Now it is the settled law, that the rights of creditors, and they alone are protected by the statute, always depend on the actual <em>situs </em>differing in this respect from the law of succession. Nor are statutes construed to apply extra-territorially, without express words; and the purpose of this act, which it is settled only protects an execution-creditor, cannot extend to property which never has been subject to execution. This act extends to partial <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>assignments; how then can it be applied: a merchant on a voyage cannot assign, however essential to protect his credit, or to raise money; nor can he send out an assignment to protect goods abroad, for the delay necessary to the mere copying in the registry will lose a mail, which carries the news of his suspension. For what purpose ? No foreign or sister state would regard such a statute, nor would a registry here, stand instead of that required by them. But the question is not open on authority, and they state the rule, thus: the transfer of personalty is always valid, if according to the forms required by the <em>lex rei sitce ; </em>but the owner <em>may </em>transfer it according to the law of his domicil, unless there be a positive law of the <em>situs </em>thereby transgressed; Story Confl.

Where there is no original privity to constitute an implied contract, and an act is relied on to give title, an election is involved ■ which must precede the suit.

This is a clear case for such a point, and the authorities aré full; Ashenden <em>v. </em>Clapham, Freem. 113, pl. 135: if the action be on a penalty or on a promise by a stranger, a demand must be laid and proved; Birks <em>v. </em>Trippet, 1 Saund. 33 b.

As a bill of interpleader proper, it would have been bad, because defendants could not pay the money into court pending the proceedings in the Common Pleas, nor could they set up the rights adverse to those to ivhich they owed allegiance, further than to give such rights an opportunity to take the proper measures to support their claims; 2 Story’s Eq. sect. 816—822; 2 Vesey, jun. 107, 109; <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Whart.%20427" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="6 Whart. 427">6 Whart. 427</a>; 4 Ad. &amp; Ell.

This proceeding was therefore strictly conformable to rule; the defendants, trustees under a voidable assignment, gave notice to adverse claimants, that if they meant to look to them, they must come in and litigate.

It was not had under the application of defendants, but the act of Assembly. The account must have been filed under the act of Assembly, and preceded any step adverse to the assignment. From that time the proceedings went on to final decree by the ordinary practice of the court where no exceptions are filed. The confirmation of the auditor’s report is a final decree, the only one known to our practice; and the certificate of the prothonotary is like the short form used in Chancery: 2 Mad. Ch. 466. Were they bound not merely to give notice, but to act contrary to the allegiance they owed to those claiming under the assignment ? The undisputed decision in Fassitt <em>v. </em>Phillips, shows they were bound to go on under the assignment until they were arrested. Had this deed been <em>void, </em>this court could not have said “ it would be useless to suspend the execution of the trust.” So far all the decisions under the 13th Eliz. accord. There was then a compulsory payment under a decree by a trustee under a voidable deed. Can it be pretended, that decree would have been made had these claimants interfered ? Surely, the court would have stayed its hand until the rights were determined. In what does this differ from a payment to an executor under a forged will ? Allen <em>v. </em>Dundas, 3 Term Rep. 125. The rule seems clear that a compulsory payment under a decree, where there is no contract or privity between the real owner and the holder of the fund, will always discharge the defendant, unless there be fraud; whether it be conclusive on the right, is entirely a different question: Mayer <em>v. </em>Foulkrod, 4 Wash. C. C. R. 502. There a legacy was paid under a decree to one admitted to have no title, but the owner was turned round to the recipient of. the fund. So in foreign attachment, 4 Bing. N.

Should not the jury have been allowed to pass upon the effect of the acts and omissions of the trustees after suit brought ? 1. If they had been strangers in interest; 2.

Even at law this is not allowed: Pickard <em>v. </em>Sears, 6 Ad. &amp; El. 474. But in equity, which this suit is said to be, time alone cures such matters: 1 Sch. &amp; Lef. 74. Here, from 1839, when the distribution was made, until 1844, no <em>narr. </em>was filed, but on all occasions the right disclaimed as trustees. 1 P. Wms. 357, is in point; there the distribution was made without objection, pending an appeal: 1 Barr, 309; Story’s Eq. s. 387. How could defendants, not privies to these rights, look beyond the act’s and declarations of the legal representatives of the adverse interests ? The Common Pleas could not see an incompatibility of relations, nor any violation of duty. How then could strangers — laymen—be expected to see it ? With how much greater force does this apply to the March assignment, where there was no such interest. But the separate action of the trustees was relied on. Their action need not be joint, so that both assent: Sug.

To the argument on the invalidity of the June assignment, nothing need be added but that by coming in under that, the property assigned in March must have been given up. That assignment was invalid for not being recorded under the act of 1818, which was intended to com-pel public notice of these instruments for the benefit of creditors, and has been liberally construed and the evil lessened : Englebert <em>v. </em>Blanjot, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Whart.%20244" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="2 Whart. 244">2 Whart. 244</a>. It is a Pennsylvania assignee who sets up the defence, that the act does not apply to him, because the property was abroad. But the evidence shows it was a sale made <a id="p519" href="#p519" data-label="519" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*519</a>of property at sea, and it was the debt that passed under the assignment. That debt, at all events, was within the domicil of the creditor. In Milne <em>v. </em>Morton, a distinction was taken between tangible and intangible property. But, under this deed, we show that both tangible and intangible property passed. As to the ex- - pedieney of the law, the creditors have no concern with that; but a sufficient answer is found in the fact, that, but for this case, they would never have obtained an account of the property. A duplicate would avoid all the difficulties from delay, and now the mail can always be anticipated. The only question is, could the legislature regulate this matter? and that they can, results from the rule that personal property has no <em>situs </em>but the residence of .the owner: 1 H.

The first arises under the assignment, dated the 22d March, 1837. The deed was not recorded within thirty days, in the county of Philadelphia, where the grantors resided, and the court below instructed the jury that it was therefore null and void under the 5th section of the act of 24th March, 1818; and that the circumstance that the property which it embraced was all in the state of New York, did not obviate the necessity of recording it in Philadelphia county, inasmuch as the law of the domicil must govern and prevail. A majority of this court is of opinion that the deed was voidable, and that, up to the time when the trustees in insolvency were appointed, and gave security, any of the creditors of the assignors might have elected to consider the deed, and could have lawfully arrested the property or funds in the hands of the assignees, for the payment of their claims respectively, by proper legal means, or by distinct and definite notice to the assignees that they intended, by legal mea-, sures, to contest the validity of the deed; which, if duly followed up by legal process, would have withdrawn so much of the funds or property from the hands of the assignees. But that after the appointment of the trustees and their giving bond, they aloné were competent to arrest the assignees in the execution of the trust, by legal measures or by notice, duly followed up by legal process. We view the case, therefore, in conformity with that opinion. The court below further instructed the jury on this branch of the case, “that the first assignment, to wit, the assignment of 22d March, 1837, was void, and that, consequently, the plaintiff had a right to recover all the money in the hands of the defendants under it, at least at the time the suit was commenced; to wit, the 29th September, 1838, with interest from that date, amounting to $ll,839j3ff%.” A majority of this court believe there was error in this instruction. The assignment was not void between the assignors and assignees, and the creditors who chose to consider it valid. And all acts done, or payments made, by the assignees, under it, without notice of adversary glaims, and while it was, apparently at least, unimpeached and fair, must be considered good, for then no presumption or proof would exist, that their conduct was not <em>bona fide </em>and innocent, and them intention honest, and without design to give illegal preferences. In Seal <em>v. </em>Duffy, 4 Barr, 274, it was ruled by this court that an assignment for benefit of creditors, not recorded within thirty days, was valid against a subsequent voluntary assignee, and that creditors could avoid the deed by levying on the property, <em>pro tanto only. </em>The opinion <em>by </em>Mr. <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>Justióe Bell runs to this effect: that the unrecorded deed remained valid for the purpose of passing the property, as to all the world, until attached by execution issued and levied; and that this interfered only so far as to withdraw what was taken in execution, from the operation of the deed. This goes beyond the exigencies of the present case, and establishes, undoubtedly, that whilst the assignees proceeded innocently in the execution of their trust, to wit, the first assignment, they will be protected by the law. And In re Wilson’s Accounts, 4 Barr, 431, it was resolved by this court, that for payments made to his <em>eestuis que trust </em>before an adverse claim by the insolvent trustee and assignee in bankruptcy, the voluntary assignee was protected. The liability of the defendants below does not therefore depend upon the mere circumstance of the non-recording of the deed, nor on the commencement of this suit, unless it gave adequate notice of an adversary claim.</p>
    <p id="b522-4" data-blocks='[["BL_522.4",522,[322,1134,1175,482]]]'>In Seal <em>v. </em>Duffy it is asserted that the only efficacious mode of arresting assignees is by execution and levy on the part of the creditor.

But in both these cases there is a clear, distinct, and unequivocal notice to the assignee that the legality of his trust is questioned by lawful measures; and that these measures, if effectual, will protect him from his <em>eestuis que trust. </em>And in all fairness the assignee is entitled to distinct and unequivocal notice.</p>

On the other, shall he. be ¡presented with impalpable shadows, vague and indefinite surmises, or mere conjectures, to swerve him from the path of duty which is plain and obvious ? Did, then, the commencement of this suit in September, 1838, by the trustees, in which- no declaration was filed until May, 1844, give the defendants or assignees any notice whatever that the deed under which they were acting — that is, the first assignment — was void as against the creditors, and that they intended to contest its validity in that suit ? On this subject the learned judge, In another part of his charge, says <em>“ </em>that the trustees who brought this suit <em>qua </em>trustees, have literally done nothing except to institute the suit we are now trying; they never ¡received a cent of money as trustees, <em>nor did they ash for awy. </em>This they carefully avoided. They never took a single step in this suit, not even so <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>far as to file a declaration <em>showing their cause of action.” </em>And yet these same trustees in insolvency were the only persons who could lawfully give notice, make a demand, or institute adversary proceedings and show their cause of action, so as to put the assignees in the wrong. If the trustees had given notice, by any lawful means, to the assignees, there would exist some reason for charging them with' electing to take upon themselves all the responsibility of the validity of the assignment, and perhaps sufficient grounds to subject them to the imputation of designing to favour the <em>cestuis que trust </em>to the injury of the other creditors. But it must be considered that the institution of the suit gave them no information whatever as to the nature of the demand. No declaration was filed; and the suit was suffered to sleep on the record for nearly six years, enlivened by no action on the part of those who instituted it. The law favours vigilant creditors, and not those who slumber on their rights, so that others may be innocently entrapped. From the very admitted fact that the assignees were protected in payments made before the commencement of the suit, it would seem to follow irresistibly that they were protected for payments made afterwards, unless the commencement of the suit gave notice of the cause of action. The' only means by which that is done, is by-filing the declaration, which was not done until 1844. There was nothing in the commencement of the suit, of itself, by which the assignees could be informed that it was for the recovery of the money received by them under the first assignment. The case may furnish reasons why the assignees, if they speculated on the subject, would have been strongly impelled to the conclusion that the suit was not for the purpose now assigned to it, but a different one. But as this case will be again tried, I pause not to enumerate them. The trustees in insolvency were the actors, by whom the assignees could be arrested, or brought to a stop. The mode of doing so was plain and easy. The responsibility was on them; and if they acted erroneously or faithlessly, as alleged, and, either by omission or supineness, permitted the assignees to disburse the money innocently, the loss ought not to fall on those who were guilty of no <em>laches. </em>Any evidence, in addition to the commencement of the suit, and the non-recording of the deed, that the ti’ustees in insolvency had given the assignees direct and distinct notice that they intended to make a claim adverse to the <em>cestuis que </em>trust, for the money in their hands, and that they intended to prosecute that claim by legal means, would be entitled to be considered by the jury; and all facts and circumstances tending to <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>show that the assignees, after full notice, by legal means, from the trustees, of an adversary claim, persisted in payments to their <em>cestuis que trust, </em>ought to be submitted to the jury for their determination, and as conducing to establish that they intended to give an illegal preference to their <em>cestuis que trust, </em>to the injury and in fraud of the other creditors. In a subsequent part of the charge of the court below, the eminent judge who sat at Nisi Prius seems in a modified manner to submit the question of notice to the determination of the jury, but in a manner so clogged and restrained in our opinion, as not to leave free scope to their minds on the subject. Thus the court say, “ <em>had they called on the trustees in a proper way for a bill of particulars, would they have been informed that the suit was intended to recover all the money, of whatever land or description, that was in their hands belonging to the estate of Moss and Phillips, as well under the first as under the second assignment ? For if they would, then there is nothing in this part of the defence.”</em>

    <p id="b524-4" data-blocks='[["BL_524.4",524,[333,1223,1179,582]]]'>The learned judge throws the whole weight of the availability of such defence upon the assignees calling in a proper manner for a bill of particulars, and the probability of the trustees, being properly called on, furnishing such bill. The mere conjectural willingness of the -trustees ought surely not to defeat a substantial defence. But the learned judge, in another part of his charge, said that the trustees would do nothing; not even show their cause of action. But I apprehend that the true answer is, that the trustees were the actors; it was their duty to give notice, and to follow up that by due and legal means; and the question is, have they done it, so as to put the assignees in the wrong, and compel them to pay the money a second time ?</p>
    <p id="b524-5" data-blocks='[["BL_524.5",524,[329,1811,1180,632]],["BL_525.1",525,[105,389,1186,2059]],["BL_526.1",526,[334,383,1179,485]]]'>With regard to the other department or branch of the case, a majority of this court are of opinion that the court below fell into error. The assignment of 22d June, 1837, under the operation of the cases of Hennessy <em>v. </em>The Western Bank, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0300-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 300" data-case-ids="480203" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0300-01">6 Watts &amp; Serg. 300</a>, and In re Wilson’s Accounts, 4 Barr, 430, must be considered as invalid. But a court of competent jurisdiction, that is the Court of Common Pleas, having jurisdiction over the fund and jurisdiction over the assignees, after a hearing, having made a decree concerning the distribution of the funds in the hands of the assignees, arising under this assignment, and which are claimed in this suit,' and the assignees having conformed to that decree, and paid the money accordingly, they are protected, and cannot be made to pay the money a second time in this or any other suit. It appears to<a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>tally insufficient to allege, for the purpose of annulling the decree of the Court of Common Pleas, and making it of no effect, that the plaintiffs in this suit were not parties to the proceeding in the Common Pleas. If not, it was their own fault; they might have become parties, and the Court of Common Pleas, upon proper application, would have been bound to hear them. By the thirty-third section of the act of 14th June, 1836, “ the several courts of Common Pleas shall have the same powers and authority, and the manner of proceeding to obtain the appearance of persons amenable to their jurisdiction, in cases of trusts, and to compel obedience to their orders and decrees, and enforce execution thereof, shall be the same as are now by law vested in the several Orphans’ Courts.” And the thirty-sixth section provides that <em>any person aggrieved </em>by a definitive judgment or decree relating to trustees or assignees, may appeal to the Supreme Court. Now it cannot be doubted but that a person who had a large claim against an individual who voluntarily assigned all his property for the benefit of certain other creditors, which assignment he could establish to be invalid, would be a person aggrieved, by a definitive decree that it was good, and transferring the funds to the persons named, as <em>cestuis que trust. </em>He would have an interest in the fund which the court distributed by the decree, and every rule of justice would demand that he should be heard; and could any court, untrammelled by the forms of actions at common law between individuals, deny him a hearing? This proceeding is analogous to proceedings in chancery where forms are flexible: they mould their decrees so as to cover the exigencies of the case, and adapt the remedy so as to suit mutual and adverse <em>claims; they </em>bring before them all persons interested in the subject-matter. Why cannot, and why should not courts of Common Pleas, when proceeding in a course of justice, not by the technical rules of the common law, do the same thing ? It would be a sorry spectacle for a lover of jurisprudence to witness a court making a decree for the distribution of the fund over which it had jurisdiction, which decree it had power to enforce by sequestration of the goods and attachment of the person of the trustee, when an individual asked to be heard, and was turned over to another jurisdiction, where he might treat the decree as a nullity, because he was not a party, and compel the trustee to pay the money over again. The case of Okie’s Appeal, 9 Watts &amp; Serg., is relied on to sustain the position that the Court of Common Pleas could not admit any person, without the deed, as a party. But that case only ruled that auditors could not do it, because their duties, <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>being inferior, allowed them only tbe power to audit and settle the account referred to them by the Court of Common Pleas. This court perceive nothing in that case which stands in their way. It was not decided till 1844, and therefore could not have even misled the trustees. That case resulted finally in decreeing the money in the hands of the assignee to a person without the deed. And if the Common Pleas or this court can decree it to a person without the deed or trust, it is because he is entitled to it; and if he is entitled, why not allow him to ask for it, as well as decree it to him on the petition of the trustee ?</p>
    <p id="b526-4" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[325,873,1187,1561]],["BL_527.1",527,[94,389,1185,1129]]]'>But the proceedings in the Common Pleas ought to be regarded as a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>which binds all the world.. It is the fund or property concerning which the court decree, and notice is directed by the statute to be given, not to the <em>eestuis que trust </em>named in the deed, but to everybody, by means of publications in newspapers; on which notice, it shall be recited that the court at a particular day will make a decree, or allow the account of the assignee, unless cause be shown why it should not be allowed. Can it be possible that a decree of a court, made after such general notice, shall not protect the assignee, who yields obedience to it, and who can be compelled to do so by sequestration of his estate and attachment of his person ? The fourth article of the second paragraph of the thirteenth section [the thirteenth section and the fourteenth section, in the original draft of the law, were thrown into one] of the law of 16th June, 1836, defining the power and jurisdiction of the courts, is in these words: The courts of Common Pleas shall have “ the determination of rights to property or money, claimed by two or more persons, in the hands or&gt;possession of a person claiming no right of property therein;” and the revisers of our code, in presenting the act “Relating to assignees for the benefit of creditors and other trustees,” accompany it with the following observation, with others, to wit: “ The design of the bill is to declare in what manner the jurisdiction given to the several courts of Common Pleas over trustees, by the fourth article of the fourteenth section [second clause, thirteenth section] of the bill relating to the jurisdiction and powers of courts, shall be exercised in the principal cases arising. It is not intended to include all the cases which may arise. In respect to those which are not mentioned in this bill, the courts will proceed in conformity with the practice in equity, prescribed or adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States.” This seems to meet the case, and to establish that in all cases in which two or more persons claim money in the <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>hands of an assignee or trustee, no matter by what right or title, the court have jurisdiction under this act relating to assignees; and if the mode of proceeding in any particular case is not pointed out in the act, the proceeding must be according to the rules and forms of equity. The revision of the code intended to make a system, and in order to give that system symmetry and usefulness, vested the jurisdiction over the fund, over the trustee, and over all persons claiming it in the same court and in the same proceeding. In support of this view of the case, to wit, that the judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction protects those who are within its grasp or process, and yield it obedience, and cannot be overhauled in a collateral suit, I refer to Mayer <em>v. </em>Foulkrod, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wash.%20C.%20C.%20504" class="citation" data-index="40" data-cite="4 Wash. C. C. 504">4 Wash. C. C. Rep. 504</a>; Philips <em>v. </em>Hunter, 2 H. Bl. 402. A majority of the court are of opinion that the court below erred in instructing the jury that the plaintiffs were entitled to recover the money in the hands of the assignees, under the assignment of 22d June, 1837, which they had paid to others, in pursuance of a decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Philadelphia county, in settling their account. It was impossible to perfect the system on the first draft of the law: firmness in the courts will fill up omissions. We are of opinion that they cannot be compelled by law to pay it a second time, and to other persons. This opinion meets the errors assigned, or renders consideration of them in detail unnecessary.</p>
