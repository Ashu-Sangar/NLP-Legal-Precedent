      <em>March </em>1. Motion to set aside an execution issued by the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of A. Barker. The record .showed that an action was instituted by P. Barker, administratrix of A. Barker, in 1834. The declaration then filed was upon a bond, in which the defendant acknowledged himself indebted “ to the persons legally entitled to the division of the estate of A. Barker, deceased but the names of the obligees were not averred.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b385-7" data-blocks='[["BL_385.7",385,[148,1490,1187,340]]]'>It further appeared by the record, that on the trial, in 1842, the plaintiff added two new counts. The first upon a debt admitted to be due P. Barker as administratrix, for so much money of the estate of A. Barker lost by the defendant, then being the agent of P. Barker, administratrix, whereby a cause of action accrued to her as administratrix of A. Barker. The second was a general count for a debt incurred by negligence, as in the first count.</p>

Barker, on account of a loss to that estate incurred by the negligence of the defendant as agent of the administratrix. The defence was, that it was executed on Sunday. His honour directed a verdict for the defendant if the bond was valid, because the cause of action had merged therein, and the proper parties were not joined as plaintiffs.

It is founded on a judgment against the defendant as the agent of the executrix, for a loss suffered by his negligence in collecting, or disposing of the assets; and if it were her loss, instead of being that of the estate, there would be great force in the argument. But she would <a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>be liable to the estate only, for having employed an unfit agent, and the defendant will not pretend that he was such. The object of the statute was to bring into the hands of the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>every thing that, when recovered, would go in a course of-administration; and if no person but the personal representative of the executrix could have execution of this judgment, he would be liable to pay it over to the administrator; and this, which shows that it is part of the assets, would be attended with risk, delay, expense, and unnecessary circuity. The substitution, therefore, was proper.</p>
