The act of 1713 had no saving in the ease of persons beyond sea, and the plaintiff’s right of action in this case was completely barred by it when the legislature, enacted the statute of 1842, which declares that the act of 1713 <em>“ </em>shall <em>hereafter </em>not extend to cases where the defendant or defendants in any suit <em>shall </em>be beyond sea at the time of such cause of action accrued:” words which are plainly prospective, and which, therefore, do not touch the plaintiff’s case.</p>
