      <em>March </em>27. A precept issued from the Register’s Court to the Common Pleas, reciting the objection of the plaintiff in error, that certain writings presented for probate, averred to be the last will and testament, and codicil of Hoxworth, were not published as his last will and testament, or, if executed by him, were obtained by undue influence, and that he, on account of imbecility of mind, was incapable of making a will, and directing an issue to be formed on the merits of the controversy between the parties.</p>

Yet as the will might be good, and the codicil bad, separate issues ought to have been formed to try the validity of each, instead of coupling them in a single one, which did not admit of division. The record is therefore remitted, with direction to set aside the judgment and proceedings, and to direct the counsel to frame an issue to try' the validity of the will, and another to try the validity of the codicil, in separate counts of the declaration. In any other proceeding, perhaps, we would not feel ourselves at liberty to pursue a similar course; but as a feigned issue is merely a contrivance to take the verdict of a jury, the courts have an unlimited discretion in directing the use of it.</p>
