      <em>Oct. </em>29. A judgment having been recovered against Robinson in 1844, before a justice of the peace, he appealed. The transcript showed “ defendant and Wm. Brownlee, each, <em>tent </em>in $200, conditioned that defendant shall prosecute his appeal with effect, &amp;c.” Judgment having been entered for plaintiff on the appeal, a <em>sci fa. </em>issued, reciting the proceedings and a recognisance by Brownlee, “ conditioned’ that no part of the property of appellant, which was liable to be taken in execution, should be removed, secreted, or assigned, or in any way disposed of, except for the support of himself and family, &amp;c., <em>“ </em>following the words of the act of 1842, abolishing imprisonment for debt. Plea, <em>nul tiel record. </em>On inspection, the court gave judgment for defendant.</p>

Rep. 149; and the <em>et </em>cetera, including all things that are material and proper to the completeness of the transaction, implied the condition then prescribed by law.

When the act of 1842 abolished imprisonment for debt, and made it impracticable to surrender the body, it became necessary to alter the form of the recognisance, in cases of appeal, to suit the altered state of the law; and this was done by prescribing a recognisance with condition that no part of the defendant’s property should be removed, secreted, assigned, or disposed of, so as to baffle an execution in case the plaintiff should recover. But, as the defendant could not have been surrendered in discharge of his bail in the case before us, the recognisance, if valid for any purpose, would be a contingent engagement merely to pay the money, and, consequently, more burdensome to the appellant than that which is presented by the statute now in force. But that such a recognisance is void, was held in Thomas <em>v. </em>Stewart, 2 Penna. Rep. 475, in the case of a similar recognisance on the act of 1819, which exempted women from imprisonment for debt; and it is applicable in every respect to the case before us. As a void record is no record, the plea of <em>nul tiel record, </em>therefore, was properly sustained.</p>
