      <em>April </em>24. The first count of the1 declaration in this case was against defendants as acceptors of a bill of exchange.

On the trial, plaintiffs read two letters from defendants to Crosby — one Nov. 21, 1839, announcing they had credited him on account of certain shipments made; the other dated Jan. 21, 1840, in which they said, “In case you are not in funds in time for the dues of February, your <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>valuation on us will be protected, and must request you not to draw under sixty days.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b529-4" data-blocks='[["BL_529.4",529,[119,503,1188,232]]]'>They then offered the deposition of Crosby, the drawer of the bill, to prove that it was drawn pursuant to the authority in the letter of Jan. 21. The defendants read the statute of Louisiana, where the bill was drawn, which gives 10 per cent, damages on the return of such bills.</p>

The same point is ruled in Smith <em>v. </em>Thorne, <a href="/watts/9/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 Watts 144" data-case-ids="1850016" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0144-01">9 Watts, 144</a>, on the authority of the Bank of Montgomery <em>v. </em>Walker, <a href="/serg-rawl/9/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 Serg. &amp; Rawle 229" data-case-ids="8878197" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/9/0229-01">9 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 229</a>; Hubbly <em>v. </em>Browne, <a href="/johns/16/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="16 Johns. 70" data-case-ids="378198" data-case-paths="/johns/16/0070-01">16 Johns. 70</a>. In Smith <em>v. </em>Thorne, it is decided, that in an action by the holder against the acceptor of a bill of exchange, the drawer is not a competent witness to prove that the bill was drawn for his accommodation, because he is liable to reimburse the defendants the costs, should the verdict be against the latter. These authorities dispose of the first error, as there can be no difference whether the suit is on the acceptance, or for refusing to accept. In every other respect the cases are identical.</p>

Without stopping to examine particularly the second count, which we think discloses no cause of action, I am at a loss to understand how the letters referred to make Crosby, the drawer, competent. If the plaintiff fails, he is liable to an action at the suit of the payee, and by the laws of Louisiana, to 10 per cent, damages, although he may be the agent of the drawee; his name appears on the bill, not as agent, but as principal.- But the letter of the 21st January, 1840, only authorizes Crosby to draw in case he is not in funds at a given time. Now the defendant alleges they refused to accept because he was in funds, and therefore had no right to draw. If it had appeared, and had been so alleged in the second count, that the plaintiffs received the draft on a promise by the defendants that it would be accepted, a different case would be furnished. As this, however, is neither proved nor alleged, we perceive nothing in the case to make this an exception to the rule so clearly settled in the cases cited.</p>
