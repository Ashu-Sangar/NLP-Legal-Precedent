      <em>Dec. </em>27, 28. Elizabeth Jenkins presented a petition to the court below, setting forth a devise to J. and L. Jenkins, the respondents, of certain land, subject to the payment of a sum of money among the children of the testator, of whom the complainant was one; that the devisees had entered, and the legacy remained unpaid; and prayed a decree compelling payment of the legacy and a sale of the land.</p>

They also denied that any thing was due to the complainant on a settlement of accounts between them. Among other reasons, they alleged that J. Jenkins and complainant <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>were tenants in common of a piece of land which they had demised to a tenant at a certain rent. That complainant subsequently entered and evicted the tenant, and had remained in possession ever since, and enjoyed all the profits.</p>

At a subsequent term, the complainant asked leave to file a supplemental replication, admitting the exclusive retention of the premises, but denying that she had ever interfered with her co-tenant’s occupation or enjoyment of half of the profits; which the court refused. *</p>

But being in the nature of a bill in equity, they may yet be made so by serving them with notice to come in and defend for their particular interests. To do so, however, it is necessary to reverse the decree, and remit the record for adjudication <em>de novo </em>when they shall have been heard. For that purpose the pleadings ought to be amended so as to present the naked question whether Elizabeth Jenkins is liable at all, without regard to favour, to account to John S. Jenkins for profits either as a co-tenant or as his bailiff and receiver,</p>
