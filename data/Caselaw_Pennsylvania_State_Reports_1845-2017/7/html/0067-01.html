All the warrants of the parties were laid down on Turner’s draft, who was at that time well known to be an assistant of Col. Canan. I do not mean to say he had a written appointment, for such written deputations were not common at that day; but he made'numerous surveys, and Col. Canan returned them to. the land-office. So, in this case, no regard was paid to the calls of the warrants, for that would have made them interfere with each <em>other; </em>nor to the agreement; but the returns were generally, if not altogether, made by Turner’s draft. The owners of this large body of warrants never complained. Those returns were received, and have remained accepted in the land-office for more than half a century; and whether there was a subsequent agreement of the parties changing their former arrangement before the board of property, is at this distance of time immaterial. The tract in question, as well as the lands in general, have been long since patented. The original owners have all paid the debt of nature ; neither their representatives nor any subsequent intruder will be allowed, to disturb those returns. In 1794, the mountain, and both sides of it, was a wilderness, and the points and descriptions in warrants and agreement were liable to great mistakes and inaccuracies. Where the country was all vacant, and numerous warrants were issued, so as to cover a very extensive territory, but little attention was paid to the leading warrant; nor was this material, as there were but few, if any, settlers who had rights that could be interfered with. The great object of the surveyors was to keep from interfering with each other, in which they were not always successful. Where the warrant was removed, it gave title from its return and acceptance into the office. The law has ever been held that, after a survey has been returned into the office, the authority of the deputy-surveyor is at an end; the lines cannot be altered or extended without a new order of survey: <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Yeates%20401" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="3 Yeates 401">3 Yeates, 401</a>; <a href="/binn/2/0037-01" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="2 Binn. 37" data-case-ids="1788942" data-case-paths="/binn/2/0037-01">2 Binn. 37</a>, 55. Another ground urged by the plaintiff in error, is that there was no actual survey made on the warrant of Samuel Bethel. This warrant was one of the fifty-two applications of Barton, and patented in 1796, since, recognised by the township and county officers for more than twenty-one years. These fifty-two tracts were returned as adjoining each other in one body, and called for other surveys of about the same date, and all those adjoining sur<a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>veys were given in evidence with their warrants by one party or the other. The whole fifty-two tracts were located and fixed by adjoining bodies of surveys: on the north the Lowdon &amp; Co.; north-east Capt. Rickets, now MeMurtrie; Richardson &amp; Co., now Morgan and others; by the latter round to the south-east, and some surveys of Phillips located in the angle formed by the Richardson &amp; Co. surveys. Samuel Bethel and every other survey of the fifty-two tracts are as easily designated on the ground as if every line had been actually run and marked on the ground. It was never held essential to the validity of a body of surveys that the lines of each tract should be marked on the ground: <a href="/binn/1/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="1 Binn. 146" data-case-ids="1787895" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0146-01">1 Binn. 146</a>. The law has only required the surveyor to run sufficient to identify the lands returned. Where a new survey is made calling for an old survey, it is improper to mark the trees anew, as the double marks create confusion : Covert <em>v. </em>Irwin, <a href="/serg-rawl/3/0283-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="3 Serg. &amp; Rawle 283" data-case-ids="1800210" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/3/0283-01">3 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 283</a>. Experience has shown the impropriety of the new survey being marked on the old line, because it has often occurred that the new marks have, with a fraudulent design, been made on the top of the old ones, the object being to destroy the old survey. More than one case of this kind is within my experience. In Lambourn <em>v. </em>Hartswick, <a href="/citations/?q=13%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%20121" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="13 Serg. &amp; Rawle 121">13 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 121</a>, the plaintiff recovered on the survey of T. West, jun., and there was no pretence of a single mark or line ever having been made on that survey. West’s was a survey of 1785. Richard Tur had made a survey of 1766, but never returned it, and on that line and the outlines of Col. Miles’s batch of surveys given in evidence all the warrants and several drafts, and having proved at least a line run where the surveys commenced, were covered. It was in Lambourn <em>v. </em>Hartswick that Mr. Justice Duncan first broached the doctrine that, where a survey has been returned twenty-one years, the owner paid the taxes, it was worthy of all consideration whether it ought not to be a presumption of law conclusive of the fact that the title was legal and perfect. The very point came before the court in Nieman <em>v. </em>Ward, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 68" data-case-ids="1852619" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0068-01">1 Watts &amp; Serg. 68</a>, where the court ruled, on great deliberation, that a return of survey into the surveyor-general’s office and a lapse of twenty-one years afterwards, without any attempt made during that time to except or object to it, such return is conclusive evidence that it was regularly made. This doctrine is analogous to the statute of limitations, and is too well settled now to be shaken. The judge, who presided in the Common Pleas, left the question of fact fairly to the jury to determine whether the plaintiff’s survey was returned on the land on which <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>the defendants had intruded, and this was all the defendants had a right to ask. I am not aware of any objection to the title derived from the tax sale; the law being settled that, where unseated land is sold for taxes, the title of the real owner, whatever it may be, passes to the purchaser: <a href="/watts-serg/1/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 166" data-case-ids="1852519" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0166-01">1 Watts &amp; Serg. 166</a>. It is the identical spot of ground assessed that passes, without regard to the name or title used in the assessment.</p>

    <p id="AnH" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[316,794,1171,286]]]'>1 and 2. The offers in papers marked C and D were clearly evidence to fix the location and .place described in the plaintiff’s survey. To show the boundaries of the fifty-two tracts, all the adjoining surveys were evidence to go to the jury. In every day’s practice, such evidence is received, and no sound land lawyer thinks of objecting to it.</p>
    <p id="ApP" data-blocks='[["BL_74.6",74,[314,1086,1170,581]]]'>3 and 4. The offer of the evidence of Mageehan and Cassiday was clearly irrelevant to the issue trying. Its truth was of no importance to the defendants. It only tended to raise a false issue before the jury, contrary to principles well settled, that surveys being returned to the land-office were not to be shaken or disturbed by the practice of surveyors in ancient times in running lines of reference, or making lines of exploration. There would be no safety if modern intruders were allowed, by such evidence, to disturb surveys returned to the land-office for more than half a century, being acknowledged and recognised by township and county officers and taxes paid for many years. Both the offers were, on every principle, properly rejected.</p>
    <p id="b74-6" data-blocks='[["BL_74.7",74,[306,1673,1174,424]]]'>1 5. The sale for taxes, deed, and acknowledgment, in open court, ,was in 1822, for taxes assessed and unpaid for the preceding year. The fact that Mulhollan paid taxes in 1823 for the land which had been sold and conveyed by the treasurer, and the price paid by the purchaser, was perfectly immaterial. If such evidence was allowed, a treasurer could destroy his solemn acts duly authorized by him at his pleasure; all our treasurer’s sales since 1815 would be, as they had been held before, a mere mockery that vested no title.</p>
    <p id="b74-7" data-blocks='[["BL_74.8",74,[1091,2114,340,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
