Case for malicious prosecution. Under a rule by defendant, arbitrators were chosen. The plaintiff agreed to rest his cas.e on the proof of a warrant and arrest and discharge by the justice, without proof of malice, want of probable cause, or damage. On award filed, defendant excepted to the decision on the point of law; this was dismissed, and judgment entered on the award. The errors assigned were in the decision by the arbitrators of the point submitted, and the entry of judgment by the court.\nDeford, for plaintiff in error.\nThe plaintiff virtually abandoned his cause by his admission, and the error is upon the face of the record: 1 Saund. 230; 2 Stark.

The remedy was by appeal: 5 Whart. 309; 3 Barr, 456.\nNov. 1."
