In any aspect of the case, the plaintiff below was the equitable plaintiff, and could have sustained the suit in the name of Hunn for his use.

The plaintiffs filed a copy of a bill of exchange, drawn by them in New York \u201cto the order of T. Hunn, cashier of the National Bank,\u201d on defendants, by whom it was accepted. The suggestion of defence was, that the bill had never been endorsed by Hunn. The court gave judgment notwithstanding, and this was the question argued here by\nFallon, for plaintiff in error.\nThe condition on which the bill is to be payable is not complied with: Chit. on Bills, 156.\nGerard, contra.\nWe have the possession of the bill and the ownership until negotiation. In point of fact, the payee\u2019s name was inserted merely for the purposes of collecting through his bank. He cited 2 Pardessus, Dro. Com. s. 349; Mullen v. French, 9 Watts, 96; 2 Dall. 144; 2 Bro.
