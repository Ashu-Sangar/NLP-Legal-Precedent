The latter section provides that in lieu of the bail theretofore required on appeals from judgments of justices and awards of arbitrators, the bail shall be absolute in double the probable amount of costs, accrued or likely to accrue, with one or more sureties, \u201c conditioned for the payment of all costs, accrued, or that may be legally recovered in such cases against the appellants.\u201d Not a word in this about payment of a daily allowance for prosecuting or defending the suit.

Morgan.\nUnder the act of 1845, plaintiff is not entitled to a per diem allowance on appeal from an award before a justice of t\u00edre peace.\nA recognisance on appeal from an award conditioned to pay costs, \u201c with $1 per day for each and every day that shall be lost by the defendant in attending to such appeal,\u201d is void under the act of 1845, for the per diem allowance is not there mentioned, and the act of 1S3C is thereby supplied.\nIn error from the Common Pleas of Fayette.\nNov. 2. The defendant appealed from a judgment of a justice in trover. The cause was arbitrated, under a rule of court, and in August, 1845, an award for defendant. A recognisance was then entered into by One Stemm, conditioned, in the event of a judgment for defendant, that plaintiff would pay all costs, \u00abwith. one dollar for each and every day that shall be lost by said defendant in attending to such appeal.\u201d The cause was again arbitrated, by agreement, and award for defendant.\nThe court allowed plaintiff \u201c $9 for his daily pay,\u201d in his bill of costs, which the prothonotary had disallowed, for which judgment was entered. Whereupon this writ of error was sued out.\n(Note. \u2014 The plaintiff did not join in the recognisance, nor was there any action taken upon it, so far as appeared from the paper book.)\nPatterson, for plaintiff in error.\nDeford, contra.\nNov. 9."
