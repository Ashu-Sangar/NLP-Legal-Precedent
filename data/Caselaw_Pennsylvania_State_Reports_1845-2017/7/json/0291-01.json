The plaintiff in error was a corporation, and had not entered bail in error.\nS. V. Smith moved to quash on that ground. By the act of 1817, a corporation cannot appeal without giving absolute security, since bail for the appearance would be nugatory. Now appeals and writs of error are put on the same footing; Schuylkill v. Thomas, 18 Serg. & Rawle, 431.\nClarkson, contra.\nThe object of that act was to place corporations on the same footing with natural persons. This is all we ask. In neither case is the writ a supersedeas without bail. But it cannot be supposed the intention was to deprive corporations of the right of review unless bail absolute was given."
