    <p class="summary" id="b155-10" data-blocks='[["BL_155.8",155,[157,1386,1169,942]]]'>This was an action on the case by Jacob Stoner <em>v. </em>Kimmel and others, they being the President and Managers of the Somerset and Bedford Turnpike Road Company. Certain shares of stock, viz. 672 shares, in the said company, which belonged to the Commonwealth, were advertised for sale at Harrisburg, on the 24th November, 1842. A resolution was adopted at a meeting of officers of the said company, by which John Metzgar was appointed to go to Harrisburg, and buy the stock <em>“ </em>for the use of said company.” The stock was not sold at that time. On the 8th April, 1843, the legislature appointed commissioners with power to sell the stocks of the Commonwealth at public or private sale; and by virtue of this authority, the commissioners named in the act sold the stock in question, viz. 672 shares, on the 6th September, 1843, to John Metzgar, for $1 per share. The sale was made at Pittsburgh. After the sale, Metzgar transferred to each of the defendants fifty-two shares of the stock. On the part of the plaintiff it was alleged, that the stock was purchased for the joint benefit of all the stockholders of the said company; and that, after the purchase, the defendants combined to defraud the stockholders, including the plaintiff, of the said stock, and to appropriate it to themselves ; and this action was brought to recover damages for the injury alleged to be sustained by him as a stockholder in the company.</p>

    <p id="b156-9" data-blocks='[["BL_156.7",156,[319,1116,1163,555]]]'>If you find for the plaintiff, the only remaining question is the measure of damages, and that is his actual loss sustained by the act of defendants. And in order to ascertain this, you will first decide what was the actual value of the stock per share when purchased, deduct from this actual value the one dollar per share paid, and you have the value of one share over and above the cost. The whole number of shares divided amongst the defendants was 422, which multiplied by the difference between the value and cost of one share, will make the gain to defendants and loss to the company on the whole purchase. From this deduct a reasonable sum for expenses in making the purchase. How much of this sum belongs to the plaintiff? This depends upon the extent of his interest in the company, &amp;c.</p>

His action is brought to recover, not the stock itself, but compensation for the loss of it. The adverse argument is, that the division of the shares among the defendants themselves, by which they excluded the plaintiff from the benefit of the purchase, being, according to his own position, fraudulent, was void and divested him of nothing. But even if he had had a remedy to compel them to transfer his proportion of the shares according to the original agreement, he had a right to waive it and go for damages for the breach of it. He had, however, no such remedy. The agreement was to purchase shares and divide them among all the parties to <em>it; </em>and it was settled in Cup <em>v. </em>Rutter, 1 P. <em>W. </em>570, that a bill will not be entertained to enforce a transfer of stock, or a contract for any other personal chattel. The ownership of the stock was vested in the defendants in this instance by their purchase in their own names; and as the plaintiff would- be without. remedy if he could not sue for damages, the direction was right.</p>
