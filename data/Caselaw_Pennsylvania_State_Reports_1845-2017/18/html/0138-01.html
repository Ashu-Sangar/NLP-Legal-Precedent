It was alleged that the whole survey, including the improvement and the part on which the warrant was laid, contained 325 acres, and allowing the 250 acres transferred by Mizener to Stewart, to be held by improvement, it left a sufficient quantity of land outside of this 250 acres to be appropriated by the McKirnan warrant, without interfering with the Mizener improvement. This position was sustained by the description given by Stewart in his warrant of the 7th August, 1844, as he described the land in the warrant as adjoining other lands of him the said Stewart, purchased from Samuel Mizener. From these facts, it was contended, that Stewart could not hold this land, by virtue of the Mizener improvement, as well as from evidence, showing, that at the time McKirnan made his survey, Mizener, who was along with the surveyor, showed his lines, and that the land from where the ore was taken, was not within his claim.</p>

The plaintiff must show, in order to sustain his action, that he was in the actual or constructive possession of the land in dispute. If the plaintiff was the l-ightful owner of the land, and there was no adverse possession, he would have sufficient possession to enable him to maintain trespass, even although he may not have been in the actual occupancy of the tract; but if there was at the time such adverse possession existing-in the defendants, then this action cannot be sustained. Whether there was such adverse possession, is a question for the jury. Was the land in dispute embraced in the Bracken claim ? Did Bracken or Mizener sell it to Stewart, and Stewart to King and Shoenberger, and were they using it <em>under the claim of title ? </em>If so, they must be considered as having the actual possession; but if it was not so transferred to them, a mere entry upon the <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>tract for the purpose of making roads, digging ore, &amp;c., would amount to nothing more than repeated trespasses against the real owner, and would not destroy his possession.</p>

David Stewart, under whom defendants claim, took out a warrant for the same land on the 7th August, 1844. It is in evidence that the written preparatory applications to be presented to the land office, were written with the certificates of the justices in the county of Indiana, on the 3d of August, for McKirnan and Stewart, Stewart having his prepared in the morning of that day, and McKirnan in the evening, when he Avas made acquainted with the intended application of Stewart, prepared earlier on the same day. Stewart entered a» caveat against the acceptance of the survey of McKirnan, alleging that the right to this land was in- him by virtue of an actual settlement, commenced in 1822, and without claiming under his Avarrant of the 7th August. The Board of Property, on the 2d March, 1846, decided in favor of the acceptance of the survey of McKirnan, who, on 5th of December, 1846, conveyed by deed to Elias Baker, the plaintiff. The defendants claimed under the said warrant to Stewart, which did not call for any improvement, and was reasonably descriptive of the land in controversy; and gave in evidence an ejectment brought by SteAYart,pending against McKirnan in April, 1846; a conveyance by Stewart to the defendants on 20th November, 1846 ; and a survey made for them by the deputy surveyor in December, 1848, for 49 acres and 24 perches.</p>

This is the requisition of the law, for the protection of the Commonwealth in its claim of interest on the purchase-money. The preparation of the intended application is in the country before two justices, and is the act of the individual, under his control, <em>in </em>fieri, forming no contract or an inception of title until filed in the land office, and the office fees and purchase-money paid to the Commonwealth. Where there is an antecedent settlement, if prosecuted and continued, it constitutes an inception of title, to be regarded and protected from its commencement. This species of title is, from necessity, to be established by <em>parol; </em>and as it consists of acts done on the ground, visible, permanent, and notorious, which are notice to the neighborhood as well as inquirers, the public, applicants, or purchasers, need not be misled by reasonable vigilance. If an individual should take out a warrant for land thus appropriated by the settlement right of another, it is at his peril; and if in ignorance of the prior right, that ignorance will be intended to he wilful, and will afford him no equity. Public policy and the security of title require that the origin of title from the Commonwealth should not depend on parol evidence, except in cases of settlement right, where it is <em>ex necessitate rei. </em>In case of an improvement, the first stroke of the ax, or other act on the ground, determines the residence, if prosecuted with diligence. A party having it in contemplation to apply to the land office for a warrant, may have his written application prepared in the county of his residence, and use or withhold it as he may think proper. It constitutes in itself no contract, but an intended application for a grant unknown to the officers of the Commonwealth until it is filed.</p>

The Commonwealth can know nothing of this priority of preparing the intended applications between individuals at a distance. It may be before different justices, and at places remote from each other. But it is alleged that one who is making his preparations to apply for the land, and while in the act of doing it is informed that another has on the same day had a like <a id="p143" href="#p143" data-label="143" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*143</a>application prepared, is acting <em>maid fide </em>in pursuing his application any further for the same land.

Yet in such case, the improver or holder of the junior warrant is bound to know the usage of the land office in allowing the shifting of warrants and the acceptance of the surveys made on them, where they did not conflict with the rights of others, acquired before a knowledge of such survey. The survey made on such shifted warrant is by a surveyor who is a public officer and the agent of the state, whose office would furnish the information to any who desired it of the appropriation of the land by a survey on the ground, to satisfy the shifted warrant.</p>

In that case, the improvement was commenced three days after the proposed application and jurat before the justices, and with the knowledge of the improver that there was such application for what was vacant land, and in respect to which the conduct of the settler under the circumstances was surreptitious. But we do not feel disposed to carry the principle there adopted any further, or extend it to a conflict of paper title, attested by warrants of different dates, the evidence of priority of title in which is that furnished by the records of the land office, and without making that priority dependent on parol evidence of precedence in their measures of preparing their intended applications in the country, or in the degree of knowledge which one may have had of the intention of the other. In such conflict between warrant-holders, not claiming under an antecedent improvement, the safest rule for the security of title and to avoid litigation, is not to go behind the dates of the warrants and open a door for parol evidence, the tendency of which would be to unsettle the priority of official grants, as well as all reliance on them as evidence of title.</p>
