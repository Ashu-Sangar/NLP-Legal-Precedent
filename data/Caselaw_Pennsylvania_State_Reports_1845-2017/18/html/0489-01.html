It is the phrase which a person speaking of an extra-judicial oath would use when he meant to deny its truth, and perhaps is not less likely to be used in that way than it is with reference to an oath taken in the regular course of judicial proceedings. Besides, it may mean a mere denial of the truth of the party’s testimony, without the corrupt want of integrity which is an essential ingredient in the crime of perjury. The words, in order to make them actionable, must be averred in the declaration to have been spoken with reference to a judicial oath, and to have been meant as a charge of perjury.</p>

These are facts, and as such must be submitted to the jury. However strong the evidence in support of them may be, it is error for the judge to decide upon it himself. But he may give a very unequivocal opinion by way of advice to the jury; and when he has a plain case to deal with, it is his duty to make him<a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>self clearly understood. We do not think that any more was done in this case. The commentaries of the judge on the facts were strong, but true; and therefore not beyond the limits of his strict duty.
