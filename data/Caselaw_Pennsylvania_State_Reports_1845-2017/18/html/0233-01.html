Such an objection must be made at the earliest moment, when by the exertion of common diligence and observation the fact might have' been discovered.

The errors were corrected, and it was not until the amended report was returned and about to be confirmed, that this relationship was suggested. It was too late. A man cannot reserve such an objection while he awaits the chances of a favorable report, and use it after he finds the report against him.</p>
