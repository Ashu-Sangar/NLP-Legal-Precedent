In looking ovér the duplicate sent to me, I discovered that Wm. Powers was not assessed with any land in the township, and I assessed the unoccupied part to him. I did not see Powers, nor did I ever say anything to him about it. He further testified: when I assessed in 1838 I could not tell what lands were assessed, and for my own benefit I drew a small draft so as to know when Í had all the land assessed. There were numbers mentioned on the duplicate by which to assess — 622 the same as No. 6 of mine; 7 same as 623. I left off all the old numbers, and noted my alterations 18 as 624, and so returned.

The assessment, together with the evidence of the course or current of title and change of description, as proved in the testimony of the assessor, and the manner of it, appearing on the assessor’s return, were of a character legally sufficient to lead an owner desirous of finding out on what land he should pay his taxes. The legal effect of evidence is a matter of law for this Court; its truth or strength is for the jury. In relation to this character of land — warranted land — it is generally necessary only to shew it to be the same land that was assessed, it being of little importance usually how the land is described in the assessment.</p>

And the only question for you is whether the land in controversy is the same that was assessed for taxes of 1839, for which it was sold in 1840, and whether the plaintiffs are invested with that title.

The Court left it to the jury to determine whether this was so, and if it were, that the sale was valid. It was decided in 1 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>166, Strauch <em>v. </em>Shoemaker, that when unseated land is sold for taxes, the title of the real owner passes, whether the land be assessed and sold in his name, in the name of the warrantee, or of a stranger. In 7 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>391, McCoy <em>v. </em>Michew, it is stated by Rogers, J., that it is <em>the land, </em>and <em>not the owner, </em>that is taxed. Powers, or those claiming under him, have no just reason to complain, because in 1838 the taxes were paid, and if examination had been made, it would have been seen that the tract had <em>two </em>numbers, viz., 624 and 18, by either or both of which it was known. The owner should have paid the taxes.</p>
