When it is observed that the accounts rendered by the plaintiffs themselves were in evidence and undisputed, showing how the account stood before either security was given, and every item afterwards, it is impossible to see any useful purpose of the question. The Court is not bound to hear evidence of admitted facts.

If this instruction does not appear very clearly, it arises from the Court being called upon to state it in answer to several points presented by the plaintiff'.
