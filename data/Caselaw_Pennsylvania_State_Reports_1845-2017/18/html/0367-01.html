Christian Rohrer claimed the lane as belonging to him, and John Rohrer removed his fence back so far as to leave a lane <em>on Ms own land, </em>and Christian placed a fence on the line of the old lane upon the place whence <em>John </em>Rohrer had removed the fence. Christian claimed that John was liable to make the one-half of the fence on the whole division line of their said lands, including the one-half of the cost of the fence placed by Christian on the line of the old lane; and he had the fence viewers convened, who decided in his favor. John refusing to pay, suit was brought by Christian against John for $19.80, and costs.</p>

The facts of that case, I conceive to have been different from the case before us. There Painter declined contributing to the repair, but threw open the private lane to the public, and abandoned the old lane. Here the lane laid out by the defendant, appears from the testimony to have been made for his benefit. Where a man withdraws his partition fence from his neighbor, and builds one on his own land without joining his neighbor, he has a right to do so; but when it is done for the purpose of promoting his convenience, and for the purpose of creating a private lane, which is to be under his control, the decision before referred to does not apply; but the person making use of such fence, by reason of the lane, is bound to contribute to maintain such partition fence. Under the circumstances of this case, as detailed by the evidence, the Court direct judgment to be entered for the plaintiff according to the agreement of the parties.”</p>

But it does not apply where a man builds his fence within his own boundaries and on his own land. For, if a man thinks proper he may build a fence within his own boundary and refuse to permit the owner of the adjoining land to join him, and thus compel his neighbor to make a fence to protect himself: 2 <em>Barr </em>126, Painter <em>v. </em>Reece; <em>Id. </em>488, Dysart <em>v. </em>Leeds.</p>

Suppose this suit determined in his favor, and he should then take away this lane; he would then have a partition fence made by his neighbor, to the expense of which he had not contributed. Has he not now the use of the partition fence ? His lane is an improvement useful to himself, and not dedicated to public use. The case therefore comes directly within the provisions of the Act of 11th March, 1842 <em>(Purd. </em>p. 511), <em>Dunlop </em>954, the third section of which directs that partition fences shall be maintained by both parties: and the 4th and 5th sections provide for the building of a new, or repairing of an old fence.

In either of these cases, the expense of the partition fence is to be equally borne and maintained by both parties. But if one of the adjacent improvers abandon the division line, and set his fence in upon his own land, and throw out a lane to public use, which he has a perfect right to do (see Painter <em>v. </em>Reece, 2 <em>Barr </em>126, and Dysart <em>v. </em>Leeds, 2 <em>Barr </em>488), they no longer <em>improve adjacent </em>lands, and are not within the statutory remedy. Such is this case. John Rohrer having lost the use of a lane, long enjoyed between him and Christian Rohrer, by Christian’s moving his fence over and appropriating the lane to himself, removed back upon his own land far enough to furnish another lane, and there built his fence. The lane thus produced is open to the public. It is open at both ends, and the proof is that Christian’s cattle use it. It amounts to a dedication of it to the public use. It is no longer improved land, therefore, within the meaning of the Act of Assembly. Yet Christian claims that John should defray half the expense of building the fence on his, (Christian’s) side, of this lane. As well might John insist that Christian should maintain half of <em>Ms </em>fence. This would bring them back to the true ground; that each must maintain his own fence along the lane without calling on the other for help. The fence viewers had no jurisdiction of the case, and the judgment of the Court below, founded on their award, is reversed.</p>
