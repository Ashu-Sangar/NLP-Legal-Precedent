In the settlement, among other credits, was contained an item of $75 through which a line was drawn, but the balance including it was not altered. The balance on this account was carried into the account of the treasurer for the next year, which was settled by the township auditors. More than six years after the treasurer went out of office, it was alleged that the item of $75 had not been paid by him; and suit was brought against him by the then school directors for the amount of the item:</p>

In April, 1839, his accounts as treasurer were audited by the township auditors, and a balance struck in his favor; to which settlement, the auditors, in the books of the district, added their certificate. Among the items in the statement of said account and settlement by the auditors, was an order on the treasurer in favor of one Thomas Acklin, a contractor for the building of a school-house, for the sum of $75, the money for which the suit was brought.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b145-9" data-blocks='[["BL_145.7",145,[165,1336,1156,303]]]'>It was alleged by the defendant that he had paid that order to Thomas Acklin; that he had presented the same order to the auditors, and that they had allowed him a credit therefor; and that the same was then entered to his credit on the township books. On inspection of the book, it appeared that a pen had been drawn <em>through this item, </em>but there had been no change made in the balance struck, corresponding with the striking out of this item.'</p>

The balance on former settlement was carried forward, without change as to it, and his accounts were again audited and settled; and to this settlement the auditors added their certificate. So the matter rested until 1845, when the then treasurer, Craft, paid an order for $75, drawn in favor of Thomas Acklin, to a man of the name of Hackney. How he got it in his possession did not satisfactorily appear from the evidence. At the time of this payment, it was not supposed to be the same order, nor was it thought to. be erroneous. But afterwards, and not long before the suit was brought, Jameson, who was the secretary to the board of directors, in his testimony stated that <em>he </em>discovered the mistake. The directors then, after the lapse of about eight years, called upon Porter for the amount of the order, alleging that he had never paid it; that the two adjustments and settlements of his accounts, before the two boards of auditors, were incorrect; that Craft, a subsequent treasurer, had paid the qrder, and that Porter must pay it.</p>

But it is contended that the auditor’s settlement in 1840, which took in the balance of the account of 1839, as if no erasure had been made, is conclusive. <a id="p147" href="#p147" data-label="147" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*147</a>We instruct you that the settlement of 1840 is not conclusive in respect to this item of $75. That if an appeal had been taken to the settlement of 1840, it would not have opened the balance on either side transferred from the settlement of the previous year. If this were the case, then every previous account which had a balance either way would be thrown open by an appeal from a subsequent account. The auditors had no power to revise the account of their predecessors. All they had to do with their account was to transfer the apparent balance due or owing, as the case might be, of the former treasurer.</p>

Here a balance was struck, which was afterwards carried forward into subsequent accounts. On the book it appears that a pen has been run through one of the items, leaving the sum carried out untouched; and the certificate of the auditors was in favor of the accountant to the extent of the whole. Can the balance be altered without unravelling the settlement ? There was conflicting evidence on the subject of the erasure, and that shows how dan<a id="p148" href="#p148" data-label="148" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*148</a>gerous it woMd be to throw the written report open to parol proof.

Had he used any art to conceal the fact, it would have suspended the statute; but no such thing could be practised, for the books were not in his custody, but open to the inspection of all. . If there was mistake by the auditors, he is not chargeable with it; for the obliteration on the face of the settlement was enough to set them on an inquiry.</p>
