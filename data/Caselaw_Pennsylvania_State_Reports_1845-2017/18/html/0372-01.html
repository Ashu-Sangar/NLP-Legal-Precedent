The Court appointed commissioners, who in November, 1851, made report accompanied with a plot or draft of a division line.</p>

Accompanying the exceptions, a number of petitions were filed, praying for the appointment of new commissioners, to review and make report, &amp;c. These petitions were more numerously signed than the original petition, by citizens of Penn township. A number of depositions were also taken; but, after argument, the Court overruled the exceptions and refused to appoint new commissioners; “ believing that the Act of Assembly does not authorize them to make such an appointment.” A <em>certiorari </em>was taken, and exceptions were filed, as follows:</p>
