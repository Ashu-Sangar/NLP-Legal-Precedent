If the assignee of a joint bond by two persons, one tbe principal debtor and the other his surety, upon which he has had judgment entered, release from its lien real estate of the principal debtor sufficient to pay the judgment, he thereby discharges his surety. If but <em>pari </em>of the property be released, the surety does not continue to be bound merely because the jury may believe that there is sufficient property of the principal left bound by the judgment to pay it; this would be throwing the risk entirely on the surety. If any of tho property of the principal has been released, it is incumbent on the <em>creditor </em>to show that the part released could not have been made available <em>at all, </em>or not beyond a certain amount; to tho extent of the value of the part released, the surety is discharged. And it is not material whether the creditor knows or does not know, at the time of the release, of the relation of principal and surety between the debtors. The object of the bond, ordinarily, is to show the relation of the debtors to the creditor, <em>not to each other; </em>and if the creditor be ignorant of their relation as principal and surety, he should act accordingly.</p>

From these facts the plaintiff raised two questions; first, that there <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>was not sufficient evidence that Henry was a mere surety, as to the plaintiff; and second, that, if the fact he so, the plaintiff did not know it. As we think that there was not sufficient evidence to justify a finding of these facts against the plaintiff, it becomes necessary to inquire whether they were material to the defendant’s case. Elsewhere it has been considered material under some circumstances, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Paige%20Ch.%20650" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Paige Ch. 650">3 <em>Paige </em>650</a>.</p>

    <p id="b214-8" data-blocks='[["BL_214.6",214,[290,1446,1175,854]]]'>Now it matters not whether the instrument shows that the debtors stand to each other in the relation of principal and surety or not. The object of the instrument is to show their relation to the creditor, and ordinarily it imports no more. The question of their relation to each other remains an open one; and hence, the admission of parol evidence to answer it does not violate the rule by which such evidence is not allowed to vary the legal import of a written instrument. It is the fact of this relation, with or without the creditor’s knowledge of it, that gives the right of substitution. The right is inherent in the transaction, if the relation exists. If it does not appear, the creditor is expected to be 'ignorant of it, and should act accordingly. While the law enforces the payment of his claim, it does not make his will the law of the contract, and allow him to shift the burden from the property of one defendant to that of the other at his pleasure. Nor may he blindly act so as to affect the rights of others, and then excuse himself by saying he did not know. He should not in any way discharge one of his joint debtors without the consent of the other; for that other has an interest in that act. The knowledge of the plaintiff of the fact of suretyship was therefore immaterial.</p>
    <p id="b214-9" data-blocks='[["BL_214.7",214,[301,2300,1165,131]],["BL_215.1",215,[196,417,1161,861]]]'>The Court below could not properly affirm the sixth point of the plaintiff; but they instructed the jury that the question was, did the release so operate as to discharge from the lien of the judg<a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>ment, property which was then available for the satisfaction of the judgment, and to what extent ? This was quite as favorable as the plaintiff had a right to ask; and, when the Court added, “ to the extent that said release did not discharge such property, the plaintiff may recover,” when they added this, they conceded too much to the plaintiff: for it was telling the jury that, though the property released would have satisfied the judgment, yet if there is any which can still be made available, the surety is, <em>pro tanto, </em>not discharged. Such a rule throws all the risks arising from the plaintiff’s act, and the uncertainty of the evidence and the fallibility of the jury, on the surety, instead of on the party whose act gave rise to them. If there be still enough of the principal’s property left, the creditor need not care that the surety is discharged. If this is doubtful, it was the creditor that made it so, and he should take the risk of it. If he has discharged any of the principal’s property, the very least that can be expected of him is, that he should make it perfectly clear that it could not have been made available at all, or not beyond a certain amount; for, by his act, he has prevented the application of the certain test afforded by judicial process.</p>
