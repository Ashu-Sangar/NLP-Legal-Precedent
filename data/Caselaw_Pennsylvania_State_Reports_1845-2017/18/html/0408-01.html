A consequence of this fact is, that the use of the firm name in the note was a fraud on Cottrell, and imposed no liability whatever on him: Baird &amp; Cochran <em>v. </em>Dowling, 4 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>398; Noble <em>v. </em>McClintock, 2 <em>W.

The Court instructed the jury that even if this were the ease, Cottrell would not <em>be </em>bound unless the money went into the firm with his “knowledge and consent,” and this direction is assigned for error. In Jaques <em>v. </em>Marquand, 6 <em>Cowen’s R. </em>497, it was held that a partner holding money in trust could not subject the firm to an action for the money by applying it to the use of the firm without the knowledge and privity of the other members of the firm; but that the firm would be liable if the money was so applied with their knowledge.</p>

Though the name of the firm was used in the case before us, it was still, in point of law, the individual note of Caldwell. Caldwell and Clay being partners on the Gettysburg Railroad, and Caldwell having drawn $8000 from the superintendent, Clay told the witness, Henry J. Shreiner, “that he had received no part of this $8000, that it was received by Caldwell; and that he, Caldwell, got it to pay his private debts, and that he had taken a note from Caldwell for the one-half of it, which he still held; and that he expected Caldwell would pay the note out of the final estimate to be made them on the work; that <em>was their understanding at the time the nóte was given.” </em>The .use of the firm name under such circumstances was a nullity. It was the note of Caldwell for all intents and purposes; and if he brought the money into the firm at Matilda Furnace, the authorities I have cited show that it did not become a firm debt. The Court were right, therefore, in instructing the jury that the knowledge and assent of Cottrell would be necessary to bind him. The only circumstance in proof to affect Cottrell with notice was the credit taken by Caldwell on the books of the firm, five days after the date of the note, for sundry bills of goods, amounting, in the aggregate, to $3761.72. Whilst this entry could not logically or legally be notice to Cottrell of the source from whence Caldwell had derived the funds wherewith to purchase the goods, it was evidence that the firm used the goods as creating a debt to Caldwell and not to Clay. It was in fact an investment of so much capital by Caldwell for which he was <em>entitled </em>to a credit on the firm books; but it raised no obligation, in morals or'law, on the part of Cottrell, to reimburse the creditor who had loaned this capital to his partner: see Greene <em>v. </em>Tanner, 8 <em>Metcalf </em>411; Ostram <em>v. </em>Jacobs, 9 <em>Metcalf 454; </em>Thorn <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wend.%20365" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Wend. 365">2 <em>Wendell </em>365</a>.</p>
