      <em>“ </em>The question is, whether the performance of the covenant is so introduced into the deed that it is to be construed as a condition; or whether the deed is an absolute conveyance of the legal title, the vendor relying upon the covenant.

In view of the decisions cited in cases bearing to it a very close analogy, we are of opinion this is a conditional grant; and we hold the action of ejectment, therefore, maintainable.”</p>

The finding by the arbitrators that the plaintiff had no cause of action, was an award in favor of the defendant; and, unappealed from, it had the same force as a judgment entered in the Common 'Pleas. It was, therefore, the judgment of a Court of competent jurisdiction on the very point in controversy; and when the same matter came in issue again between the same parties, or their representatives, as it did in this case, the record of the first judgment was conclusive against the plaintiff’s right to recover. This was the rule laid down in the Duchess of Kingston’s case, and its correctness. has never been disputed. The public interest demands that litigation should not be perpetual, and justice requires that when a man has once answered to a claim, and had judgment ren<a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>dered upon it, either against him or for him, by a tribunal vested with power to try it, he should not be harassed for the same cause again.</p>

The covenant or condition (call it which you will) must have a construction consistent with the plain reason and sober sense of the men who made it. There was no agreement here to pay money, and it was, in our opinion, most manifestly contemplated by the parties that Siars should receive the necessaries promised at the only place where Lane could have them to give, and the personal attendance which his condition might require where Lane and his family would be present to render them. If Lane had been guilty of misconduct, or had lacked good faith in the execution of his agreement, the case might be wholly different; but Siars lost all right to demand performance of the contract when he went away without cause or provocation, and so made it impossible for the other party to do what he had promised, except at an amount of trouble and expense which it would have been wholly unreasonable to require.</p>
