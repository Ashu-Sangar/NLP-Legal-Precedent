I drove a stake where they intended to place the front door. This was the grade of Fifth and Grant streets at the point of intersection, as authorized by the resolution of 1828. This was in the summer. The foundations wmre then sunk, except at the north-east corner. The foundation was sunk to the shale and soap-stone. I would think it a good solid foundation. The building, in my opinion, cost $25,000.”</p>

In 1836, the councils passed an ordinance to reduce the grade ten feet at the intersection of Grant and Fifth streets, below that fixed in 1828, and to reduce the grades of these streets in such manner as to correspond with'that fixed at said intersection. In 1847, they passed another ordinance to reduce said grade seven feet more, which ordinances were recorded, published, &amp;c., and the city authorities caused the streets to be cut down to the lowest grade before mentioned.</p>

Several witnesses expressed the opinion on the trial, that the building ought to be taken down. Some testified that the building might be protected from falling by the erection of walls on Grant and Fifth streets. Witnesses also testified, under exception, that the church property had been increased in value by the change of grade of the streets ; and the Court instructed the jury that this increase of value must he deducted from the damages otherwise sustained by reason of such grade. The jury returned a verdict on two of the counts in the declaration in favor of the plaintiff, for the sum of $4000 damages; notwithstanding which Lowrie, J., subsequently entered judgment on a reserved question <em>for the defendants.</em>

To the Commonwealth here, as to the king in England, belongs the franchise of every highway as a trustee for the public; and streets regulated and repaired by the authority of a municipal corporation, are as much highways as are rivers, railroads, canals, or public roads laid out by the authority of the quarter sessions. In England a public road is called the king’s highway; and though it is not usually called the Commonwealth’s highway here, it is so in contemplation of law, for it exists only by force of the Commonwealth’s authority. Every railroad, canal, turnpike, or bridge company, has its franchise by grant from the state, and consequently with its original qualities and immunities adhering to it. Every highway, toll or free, is licensed, constructed, and regulated by the immediate or delegated action of the sovereign power; and in every Commonwealth the people in the aggregate constitute the sovereign. But it is the prerogative" of a sovereign to be exempt from coercion by action; for jurisdiction implies superiority, and a sovereign can have no superior. At the declaration of American independence, prerogatives which did not concern the person, state, and dignity of the king, but such as had been held by him in trust for his subjects, were assumed by the people here and exercised immediately by themselves; among the rest, unwisely I think, the prerogative of refusing to do justice on compulsion. That a suit cannot be maintained against the state without its consent, is shown by the statute which enabled Pennsylvania claimants to sue the state for the value of lands ceded to Connecticut claimants within the seventeen townships in Luzerne county. But this prerogative would be unavailing if it could not protect the agents whom the Commonwealth has necessarily to employ. It was applied to the protection of a private corporation in the Monongahela Navigation <em>v. </em>Coons, and Henry <em>v. </em>The Allegheny Bridge; in which it was held that a chartered company to improve the navigation of a public highway, or to build a bridge, is not answerable for consequential damages; and it was applied to the protection of a municipal corporation in Green <em>v. </em>The Borough of Reading; The Mayor <em>v. </em>Randolph, and the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad; to which may be added every decision on the subject in our sister states, except the decisions in Ohio, which, however founded in natural justice, are not founded in the law which prevails elsewhere.</p>

The modification of the remedy would be for the legislature, which can turn compensation for a permanent detriment into the price of a prospective license; but to attain complete justice, every damage to private property ought to be compensated by the state or corporation that occasioned it, and a general statutory remedy ought to be provided /to assess the value. The constitutional provision for the case of private property <em>taken </em>for public use, extends not to the case of property <em>injured </em>or <em>destroyed; </em>but it follows not that the omission may not be supplied by ordinary legislation. No property was taken in this instance; but the cutting down of the street consequent on the reduction of its grade, left the building useless, and the ground on which it stood worth no more than the expense of sinking the surface of it to the common level. The loss to the. congregation is a total one, while the gain to -holders of property in the neighborhood, is immense. The legislature that incorporated the city, never dreamt that it was laying the foundation of such injustice; but, as the charter stands, it is unavoidable.</p>
