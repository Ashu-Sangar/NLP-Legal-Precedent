The plaintiff then called witnesses, one of whom testified that the price of the land was paid by <em>James </em>Carson, another uncle of the plaintiff. Another witness testified that James Carson and the <em>elder </em>Benjamin were both bachelors, living together, and the younger Benjamin with them, he being then about seven years old. They spoke of this land, and said they had taken it up, intending it for little Benjamin Carson, and that they would get the patent in Benny’s name, that when he comes of age it will need no alteration. Little Benjamin lived with them until he was 16 or 17 years old. Many years afterwards <em>James </em>Carson told the witness that Benjamin, <em>the </em>uncle, was going to cheat little Benny out of his land.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b458-9" data-blocks='[["BL_458.7",458,[339,1400,1163,642]]]'>Another witness testified that “ both the elder Carsons had told him that the land belonged to young Benjamin; that they had the writings made out in the name of the elder Benjamin, that they might “shove it over” without making a new deed, and that there were not many young fellows, like young Benjamin, who can say when they come of age that he is a freeholder.” James Carson died some time before this suit was brought. Another witness testified that the uncles showed him the lines of this tract; they called it. little Benny’s ; said they intended it for him, and would give it to him. Another witness testified that James Carson had told him that when Benny was a little boy, he and his brother concluded to take up this land for little Benny. They took out the patent in the name of old Benny, so that it could be handed over when Benny came of age. When he came of age.it could be handed over to him — it would need no assignment.</p>

Why, simply that the land belongs to James and not to Benjamin. This does not tend to establish a right in the younger Benjamin, the plaintiff below, unless he also shows some title from James. But this allegation rather adds to the difficulty of the plaintiff’s case, for it gives him two parol titles to establish instead of one; first that of James and then his own, and unless both are clearly proved the statute of frauds must rule the case in favor of the written title. The claim in this form excludes all the admissions by Benjamin, the elder, that he had given or intended to give this land, for it was not his to give.</p>
    <p id="b459-9" data-blocks='[["BL_459.13",459,[166,1689,1173,342]]]'>The real claim of the plaintiff is contained in the allegation that when he was a little boy, his uncles James and Benjamin took out a patent for this land for him, in the name of his uncle Benjamin, intending to give it to him when he came of age. It is not alleged that they ever did give it to him, and without part performance, how is the statute of frauds to be avoided ? Kind intentions are never enforced by law. Even promises, if without consideration, are not contracts, and no action lies for the breach of them.</p>
