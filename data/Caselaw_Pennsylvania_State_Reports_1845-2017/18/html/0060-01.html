A term for years is a chattel, which may be sold on a common law execution.

In this case the sheriff having by the <em>fieri facias </em>an authority to sell, his return of the sale to Downing, and the bill of sale delivered to the purchaser, was sufficient, with the other proceedings, to prove the transfer of the title of Skillen to Downing, the plaintiff, and in the opinion of the Court below to that effect, there was no error.</p>

Both parties claimed under William Skillen, who it was admitted became possessed of the premises, claimed under a lease to him from Humphrey and Johnston for five years, from the 1st of April, 1848, at a yearly rent of $350. Skillen by agreement, dated 9th September, 1848, with Solomon Schoyer, did grant, bargain, sell, <a id="p63" href="#p63" data-label="63" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*63</a>transfer, and assign unto Schoyer, his heirs and assigns, all his' right, interest, and claim, under the said lease, to the lot and buildings thereon, for and during the term of four years, from and after the first of April, 1849, with all the rights of Skillen under said lease; Schoyer agreeing to pay and give said Skillen three hundred dollars, and twelve patent gold lever watches, and pay the lessors aforesaid, their annual rent. It was further a part of the agreement, that the valuation put on the buildings at the expiration of the lease, was to be divided between Schoyer and Skillen, who both executed this agreement under their hands and seals. Schoyer, by writing under his hand and seal, on the 11th of Jauuary, 1849, assigned all his interest, &amp;c., under said agreement and assignment to William H. Williams, one of the defendants. Skillen had leased to Espían and Joseph Williams part of the premises on the 29th May, 1848, to hold from the 1st of June, 1848, till 1st April, 1849, which lease Skillen on the 14th of June, 1848, assigned to Schoyer. Skillen, it seems, occupied one of the houses on the premises. Williams, under his title, leased the premises to divers individuals, who went into possession on the 1st of April, 1849, under him as tenants, and were in possession at the institution of this action of ejectment, in June 1849; and in which Williams was admitted to defend as landlord.</p>

Williams, by his tenants, entered on the premises on 1st April, 1849, and continued in that possession when the ejectment in this ease was served in June following. The possession was taken by Williams, under the terms of the transfers, as soon as the right of possession accrued to him; and the question is, what was the legal right of Williams to exclusive possession of the property during the residue of the term. He is a purchaser for value, prior in time to the purchase by Downing at sheriff’s sale.</p>

This is to apply the law as to personal chattels to leasehold estate, which is a chattel real. Chattels real are distinguishable from personal chattels in material circumstancés. Chattels personal pertain to the person; use and occupancy are the <em>indicia </em>of property, and the policy of the law requires a change of possession and delivery as essential to a valid sale. But leasehold estate, which savors of realty, does not admit, from its peculiar incidents, of delivery and manual occupation as a personal chattel. Occupancy of realty alone in the absence of actual fraud will not vitiate a sale, and will not excuse a creditor or purchaser from reasonable inquiry as to right and title.</p>

J. Gribson says that the species of legal fraud which arises by construction of the statute of 13 Eliz. from retention of possession after a sale or pledge, is predicable of the possession, not of land, but of chattels personal. The law in relation to the possession and delivery of personal chattels, is inapplicable to chattels real. A person dealing in relation to a chattel real, must look elsewhere than to occupancy as the evidence of ownership. If he fails to inquire and investigate, it is at his peril. It is said by this Court in Sowers <em>v. </em>Vie, 2 <em>Harris </em>99, “ no man bids for either freehold or leasehold without having investigated the qualities and value of the property.”</p>

This was foreign to the question before the Court in that case, which was the sale of a freehold by the sheriff and the delivery of actual possession. Much as we respect the opinion of the learned judge in that case on a question of law, yet, without his usual accuracy and discrimination, he confounded the law in relation to personal chattels with that of chattels real, as appears by the authorities referred to in the opinion: 2 <em>Term R. </em>591; 1 <em>Wils. </em>44; 1 <em>Ld.

They were not required by law to record their assignments; nor was there imposed on them any form and manner of notice. It does not appear in evidence that any inquiry was made of them or Skillen as to the tenure of the property in controversy. What was there in the relation of Downing that entitled him to notice from William H. Williams when he received the assignment of the four years of the term ? Downing only became a judgment creditor of Skillen on the 6th March, 1849, for the sum of $110, on which execution was issued and a levy and sale of the leasehold interest in the same month; of which sale it does not appear that Williams had any notice or knowledge. Did the plaintiff or the sheriff treat this leasehold estate as a personal chattel in the manner of sale ? The sale was not on the premises, but at another place, and without the presence of the chattel or any change of possession, of which it was incapable. Would a sheriff’s sale of a personal chattel have been so conducted? We think not, without a departure from established usage and practice.</p>

Nor do the Acts of Assembly require them to be recorded, when the possession accompanies the lease, unless the lease is for a term exceeding twenty-one years. Under this provision of law, we see that there is little or no occasion for it in practice, as leases without possession in the lessee, and terms for years exceeding twenty-one years, are both of rare occurrence.
