Because John R. Johnston had no authority to give the transcript from the docket of David Johnston. By the Acts of 20th March, 1810, 21st January, 1839, and 13th October, 1840, a justice, on the expiration of his commission, or in case of his resignation, may either retain his docket or deliver it to one in commission, who may give transcripts from it; but there is no provision in favor of one <em>not in commission, </em>giving a transcript from the docket of a former justice. 2. The transcript sets out the return of a summons, but does not show that it was served. The case is therefore to be treated as an <em>ex parte </em>proceeding, and governed by the same rules as a judgment in foreign attachment, or where there has been no notice. As to the second exception: if the transcript was not admissible upon account of its inherent defect, parol testimony could not cure it, and was therefore properly rejected.</p>
