In an action on a warranty that a horse was sound in all respects, a person from whom the defendant had previously purchased the horse under a similar warranty, was a competent witness for the <em>defendant </em>to prove that the horse was sound. In case of proof in the action, of <em>unsoundness, </em>the verdict would not be evidence for the defendant in this suit, in an action by him against the witness, as it related to unsoundness <em>at a different time; </em>and besides, the witness was not a party to the suit trying: the objection was applicable only to his credit.</p>

That the horse was laboring under a chronic ligamentary lameness which was incurable; besides, he knuckled behind and was tender before; neither was he gentle in harness, as he was baulky and would refuse to pull, and was gene<a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>rally unmanageable in starting, thus rendering him useless to the plaintiff and his family.

The horse blundered. He seemed stiff; he was not a safe horse to drive. When in a wagon, he would not stand whilst persons were getting into it.</p>

It is, however, for the jury to remember the testimony and regard it in making up their verdict, as given on both sides. In regard to such warranty the law is, that it is binding on defendant for any secret maladies which the said horse may have had at the time of sale, and which could not be discovered by the usual trials and inspections. A general warranty does not cover patent defects, being such as are obvious to the buyer; they must be such <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>as a man, unless lie be perfectly incompetent to conduct business, cannot help observing.

Proof of unsoundness at one sale may be evidence of the same kind of unsoundness at another sale a short time before or after; but the evidence grows weak as the period between the two sales is enlarged; in this case it was three months. If unsoundness had been proved in this case, this defendant, in a suit against the witness on his warranty, could not give the record in evidence, for the witness is no party to it, and because it relates to unsoundness at another period. Like principles would also apply, if the soundness were established here, and this defendant should sue the witness for a previous unsoundness.
