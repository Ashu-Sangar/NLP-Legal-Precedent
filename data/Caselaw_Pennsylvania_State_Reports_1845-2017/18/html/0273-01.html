The title to the lot was vested regularly through mesne conveyances, <em>expressly subject to and under the before-mentioned conditions, </em>in the plaintiffs in error, who were incorporated on the 8th February, 1816, in order that the lot thus granted might be more fully appropriated to the purposes intended by the donors.

Perhaps the argument that, because they cannot pay this debt, therefore they could not, and hence that they did not contract it, would be equally legitimate. Yet they may run in debt, and then they must provide for payment; and to secure this, they may pledge such property as they have. If they have any title at all, they may pledge that; and, like other people, they may do more than that, if anybody will accept a pledge of moonshine. Moreover, they are not allowed to dispute the title which they have pledged, and the defence is an ingenious attempt to do this. True, this is a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>demanding a sale; but the <em>res </em>is the title of the corporation, and whatever that is, qualified or absolute, it will pass by the sale.</p>
    <p id="b275-8" data-blocks='[["BL_275.10",275,[193,1580,1162,389]]]'>The rule that avoids all acts of a corporation which are unauthorized by the purposes of its creation, is only a special form of the logical rule, <em>derivativa potestas non potest esse major primitiva, </em>and here it is entirely misapplied. The fallacy consists in inferring the corporation’s authority from its land, instead of from its character; and in making an accidental defect in its title to land evidence of an essential defect in its own nature. In this instance, the corporation occupies a position very like to that of a tenant in tail who aliens in fee simple, an act which is by no means void.</p>
