The conveyance of land is regulated by the law of the <em>situs; </em>no foreign record is evidence of it, but either common law or statutory proof must be ■made of it. Hence, the record of a proceeding on an insolvent’s petition in Baltimore County Court, under a statute of Maryland," with an office copy from that court of <em>a conveyance </em>of the insolvent’s property to a trustee for the benefit of creditors, recorded in the same court, was not evidence of the existence of the deed to the trustee, no exemplification of the record of the deed in <em>Greene </em>county, Pennsylvania, <em>in which the land lies, </em>having been produced.</p>

Donaldson, as executor of the will of Samuel Johnston, deceased, <em>v. </em>Henry Phillips and Samuel Rayle, to recover a tract of land in Greene county, Pennsylvania, containing 400 acres. The main question involved related to the sufficiency of proof of the execution of a deed, executed in Maryland, and conveying, <em>inter alia, </em>the land in dispute, situate in Pennsylvania. The land was patented on 15th June, 1787, to Isaac Sidman. Sidman, by deed dated August 10, 1787, recorded in Greene county in 1802, conveyed the land to <em>John </em>Young of Baltimore, who conveyed to <em>Charles B. Young, </em>by deed dated 29th July, 1795, and recorded in Greene county on 7th June, 1802.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b170-11" data-blocks='[["BL_170.9",170,[325,1894,1162,556]]]'>Charles B. Young and James Buchanan were engaged in business in Baltimore, as partners. They became embarrassed, and ultimately took the benefit of the insolvent laws. Their petition was addressed to the Chancellor. The list of property of Charles B. Young included the land in dispute. The trustee was appointed by the Chancellor. In pursuance of the order, Young and Buchanan executed a deed to Samuel Moale, trustee, dated 24th Sept., 1799, conveying all their property, real, personal, and mixed. The proceedings on the application were recited in the deed. The deed was acknowledged by the grantors, before two justices of the peace of Baltimore county, and in 1799 was recorded in the book of land records <em>in Baltimore county. </em>It was not recorded in Pennsylvania.</p>

Either common law or statute proof must he made of it. What is the first ? The deed itself, and, unless possession be shown to have gone with it for thirty years, proof of execution by subscribing witnesses, or evidence of handwriting. If it is not produced, proof of previous existence, contents, and destruction or loss, by the oaths of witnesses able to swear to the facts. What is the second ?' The deed itself, with a proper acknowledgment of the grantor appended to it, or <a id="p172" href="#p172" data-label="172" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*172</a>proof of execution by the subscribing witnesses; in either case, certified by an officer competent to take it; or else an exemplification of a proper record of it in the office of the proper county. All beside is moonshine. What was the evidence proposed ? The record of a proceeding on an insolvent’s petition, under a statute of Maryland, in Baltimore County Court, with an office copy of a conveyance of the insolvent’s property to trustees for the benefit of his creditors, recorded in the same Court. No exemplification of it from the records of Green county, in which the land lies, was produced, for the original was not recorded there. It is idle, then, to talk about the power of the magistrates in Maryland to take the acknowledgment; for it does not appear by any competent proof that there is, or ever has been, a conveyance to the trustees. The office copy from the land records of Baltimore county, would doubtless be evidence in Maryland by force of its law; but it is certainly not evidence here by the law of Pennsylvania. The question is ruled by the <em>lex loci reí sitce; </em>and trying it by that, the result is that the evidence was properly excluded.</p>
