Upon the judgments in favor of said appellants writs of <em>fieri facias </em>were issued on the said 6th day of January (and placed in the hands of the sheriff before the writs <a id="p511" href="#p511" data-label="511" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*511</a>issued by the appellees and other appellants), returnable to Feb.

D. 1849.- The stock of goods was a large one, and the sheriff deputed William Potts and Ulrick Leffert to assist him in the execution of said writs, they being acquainted with the goods, their value and selling prices, having been clerks in said Reamer’s store. For the purpose of making as much as possible for the creditors, the arrangements contained in the paper marked “ A” in the auditor’s report, were entered into and the sales were proceeded with according to those arrangements. The goods not having been disposed of by the sheriff upon the <em>fieri facias, </em>writs of <em>vend. exp. </em>were issued upon the judgments of said appellants returnable <em>to April Term, </em>1849, and the agreement contained in paper “ A” was renewed and made applicable to those writs, and the sheriff proceeded to advertise and sell upon them as he had done upon the writs of <em>fieri facias. </em>The money made upon the writs of <em>fieri facias </em>and <em>vend. exp. </em>amounted to $8527.83, which was applied to the payment of the executions in the hands of the sheriff whose liens upon the goods were prior to the lien of the execution in favor of Sarah D. C. Reamer, except $534.94, the balance after paying said prior executions, which was applied to the payment of the costs and in part payment of the debt of her execution. <em>Alias writs of vend, ex., </em>were issued upon the judgments of said appellants returnable to <em>August Term, </em>1849, to dispose of the goods which the sheriff had returned “ remained on hands unsold for want of time.” The sheriff again advertised and proceeded to sell as he had done upon the <em>fi. fas. </em>and <em>vend. exp.; </em>riot howr ever under the agreement marked “ A,” because <em>that was not continued after April Term, </em>but because he believed that more could be made for the creditors in that way, than could have been made by selling them at public outcry. The money made upon the writs of <em>alias vend. exp. </em>amounted to $6141.56; and the questions presented to the Supreme Court applied only to that fund, as the money made <em>previous to the April Court, </em>was distributed by the sheriff without objection on the part of those who afterwards claimed the money made after the April Court.

Mr. Loy did not make any objection to the manner of selling the goods — all he wanted wTas to have the money in Court. I did not tell Mr. Loy, that if he did not agree to the arrangement I would close the store.”</p>
    <p id="b516-9" data-blocks='[["BL_516.9",516,[331,1626,1159,388]]]'>Such is the evidence to implicate Mr. Loy in this agreement. It is insufficient. The time of issuing the <em>fi. fa. </em>for Z. Gemrnill &amp; Co., is not ascertainable from the paper-book, but as the writ Was returnable to the April Term of 1849, it must have been in the lifetime of the arrangement. These creditors were entitled to have their writ levied and proceeded with according to law. The instructions given by their counsel were consistent with this right. It was not necessary for him to <em>objeet </em>to the mode adopted for selling the goods: the question is, did he <em>assent </em>?</p>
    <p id="b516-10" data-blocks='[["BL_516.10",516,[332,2011,1159,432]],["BL_517.1",517,[156,418,1162,87]]]'>Assent is not to be implied from absence of objection. It is susceptible of affirmative and direct proof, and before Z. Gemrnill &amp; Co., can be treated as in <em>pari delicto </em>with the other creditors, we must have evidence of that nature that they or their counsel recognised and assented to the arrangement of 10th January, 1849. If Mr. Loy wanted the money in Court, it was that he might obtain the fruits of his execution. Had the sheriff told him as he did Mr. Cox, that he would close the store if he did not agree to the arrangement, and had Loy replied as Cox did, there might be some ground for implying his assent to the existing <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>arrangement; but as the evidence is, we see no ground for presuming assent, but ground rather for excluding such a conclusion.</p>
    <p id="b517-6" data-blocks='[["BL_517.4",517,[151,505,1168,1329]]]'>We are satisfied with the results to which the evidence touching the assent of the rest of the appellees conducted the auditor. Having signed the agreement in behalf of several clients, Mr. Tate assented to it in behalf of those for whom he subsequently became employed, some of whom obtained their judgments and executions on the express condition of his assent. The testimony is full to these points. Could these latter clients of Mr. Tate, by abandoning him and employing Mr. Cox as their counsel, rid themselves of the consequences of Tate’s assent ? To permit this would be to sanction a gross fraud upon the other creditors as well as upon Reamer the defendant. But if Cox was brought in only as associate counsel, or as the partner of Tate, he was equally bound with Tate to the faithful observance of the arrangement. He must have so considered it, for when the sheriff told him if he did not agree to the arrangement in paper A the store would be closed, which would have been the breaking up of that arrangement ; Cox replied, “ he did not wish that, and told the sheriff to go on, that he would give him no instructions at that time, but if he came to any other conclusion he would give him written instructions.” What was that but express assent on the part of Cox to the arrangement ? This occurred in the lifetime of the <em>fi. fas., </em>but the “ written instructions” never came to these writs. The sale was permitted to proceed according to ,the agreement of 10 th January, 1849, till after the return day of these writs. The written notice of 24th April, 1849, related to <em>alias </em>writs, but was unnecessary then, for the arrangement was not renewed after the April Court, and the sheriff then had no authority to sell except in form of law. If, therefore, the appellees sought advantage over their fellow creditors by substituting Cox for Tate, they failed, not only beceause they attempted a legal impossibility, but also because Cox assented to the arrangement in paper A, as well as Tate.</p>
    <p id="b517-7" data-blocks='[["BL_517.5",517,[152,1833,1165,562]],["BL_518.1",518,[318,424,1159,87]]]'>• It has been suggested that the arrangement was not within the scope of professional authority; but we think it was. The creditors of Reamer, many of whom were residing at a distance, were all represented by counsel. Reamer had a large and valuable store of goods. To subject it to a sheriff’s sale in the ordinary mode, in a small country town, would have been to sacrifice it. To prevent this, and to secure to the creditors the utmost that could be made out of it, the counsel, all except Barclay and Loy, came into or assented to the arrangement of 10th January, 1849. It was a proper occasion for the exercise of professional discretion. The appellees have no reason to complain of their counsel or of others, for had the goods been forced to a speedy sale, the writs prior to theirs would have taken the proceeds. If the appellees <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>get nothing under the arrangement, they would not have enjoyed even a <em>chance </em>of participation without it.</p>
    <p id="b518-6" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[313,511,1164,513]]]'>Again it is objected that the agreement was not binding, because, so far as concerns the counsel of these appellees, it was not in writing, and the rule of Court is relied on which requires all agreements of attorneys, <em>“touching the business of the Court,” </em>to be in writing. This rule relates to the ordinary routine of practice, and is designed to exclude unseemly disputes and contradiction among gentlemen of the bar in the presence of the Court. It has no application whatever to agreements made to facilitate or guide a sheriff in the execution of writs in his hands. Applied as it is sought to be here, this rule of Court would be a higher law than the statute of frauds and perjuries, for that may not be so interpreted as to make it an instrument of fraud.</p>
    <p id="b518-7" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[313,1023,1161,216]]]'>It remains only to add that Platt, Taylor, Hollingshead &amp; Sides, and Platt, Taylor &amp; Hollingshead, not having submitted their claims to the auditor in season, have no place in this appeal. It is apparent, however, from all that is before us, that they would have no claim on this fund if they were regularly in Court.</p>
