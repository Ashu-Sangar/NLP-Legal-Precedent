The defendants pleaded not guilty, with leave, &amp;c. Oct. 18,1849, verdict rendered for the plaintiffs for $275, subject to the opinion of the Court. Nov. 17, 1849, Hepburn, J., observed that “the plaintiffs have put their case exclusively on the ground of the defendants being <em>common carriers ; </em>hence the question of want of due care did not arise, nor indeed from the evidence could it have arisen in the cause. If the defendants were not liable as <em>common carriers, </em>it is plain they are not liable at all.” Being of opinion that they were not common carriers, he directed judgment to be entered in favor of defendants <em>non obstante veredicto.</em>

The plaintiffs were the owners of a raft of logs lying near the mouth of the Allegheny, and the defendants contracted to tow said raft to the saw-mill of the plaintiffs, at Braddock’s Field, on the Monongahela. In pursuance of the agreement, the defendant’s boat was attached to the raft, and they proceeded with it a part of the distance up the river, when the farther progress of the same was arrested by a sudden rise in the river; and they were compelled, with the assent of one of the plaintiffs, to tie up the raft at the shore. The river continued to rise during the night, and the raft was carried off by the water, and only part of it recovered by the plaintiffs.</p>
    <p id="b41-10" data-blocks='[["BL_41.16",41,[165,1596,1170,338]]]'>The plaintiffs have placed their claim exclusively on the ground of the defendants being common carriers; and the question of want of skill, care, and attention by the defendants, does not arise. The question of the liability as common carriers of those engaged in the business of towing boats, rafts, &amp;c., is one of great importance to the public, as well as those engaged in this business, which gives much employment to capital and labor on the western and eastern waters of this Commonwealth..</p>
    <p id="b41-11" data-blocks='[["BL_41.17",41,[165,1941,1172,514]],["BL_42.1",42,[339,434,1163,75]]]'>A common carrier is in the nature of an insurer; and if he carries without any qualification of his liability, he becomes an insurer against all but tempest, and the public enemy; he insures against fire, theft, robbery, and the fraud of his own servants. His vigilance and faultlessness do not excuse him. It is the policy of the law to impose such responsibility on a common carrier, as one intrusted with the property and goods of others, and of which he and his agents and servants have the exclusive possession and control. It is reasonable that he should be thus held liable, to prevent collusion, and make him answerable for the honesty, attention, care, and skill of the servants whom he chooses and employs. The owner of goods and property committed to a common carrier rarely <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>accompanies them; and if he does, has neither possession nor control.</p>
    <p id="b42-6" data-blocks='[["BL_42.4",42,[335,521,1168,1199]]]'>The conduct of the carrier and his servants not being under the view and direction of the owner, he would seldom be able to prove the cause of the loss of his property. To prevent the necessity of going into circumstances impossible to be unravelled, the law presumes against common carriers, unless they can show the loss was caused by the public enemy, or such acts as could not happen by the intervention of man, as lightning and tempest: 2 <em>Kent’s C. </em>602-3. The reason of the law is that the owner of goods lost would never be able to prove the cause of the loss. His witnesses must be the carrier’s servants : <em>Sto. Bail. </em>491. The law of liability of common carriers is one of public policy, and is to be maintained. Does this policy extend to the towing of boats and rafts on navigable or other waters ? This exercise of power is peculiar and limited. It is generally for short distances, under the eye and observation of the owner, who may and often does accompany, by himself or his agents, the property that is towed for him. If there is peril from the sudden rise of the water, or other unforeseen danger, he may terminate the conveyance at any point of safety in his opinion. The cargo on a canal-boat towed is property in the care of the conductors of such boat as common carriers, of which they have the exclusive possession, and for which they are responsible, knowing its value and quality. The captain or owner of a boat undertaking to tow a loaded canal-boat, we presume, neither inspects the cargo, or overhauls it. His contract has reference to size, tonnage, and obstruction, to which the power of his boat is to be applied; and the connection of his boat, by the chain or rope, with the vessel and rafts to be conveyed to a fixed point, is the limited control he has over the property thus transported.</p>
    <p id="b42-7" data-blocks='[["BL_42.5",42,[337,1720,1168,512]]]'>It was an apt illustration of the learned judge who delivered the opinion of the Court below, in saying, “ wherein does this case differ in principle from that of a railroad company, or the state furnishing locomotive engines for drawing the cars of individuals over the road ? The application of steam-power to towing boats, &amp;c., is only distinguishable from horse-power where it can be used, in the extent of the power. Would it be pretended that the man who furnished horses and a driver, to tow a boat or raft, was an insurer as a common carrier for the boat to be towed and its contents ? We do not think that public policy and security require the extension of the law of common carriers to those engaged in the towing of boats, rafts, &amp;c.”</p>

Nor are the proprietors of a stage-coach, used for the conveyance of passengers, liable as common carriers for goods sent by such coach: Beckman <em>v. </em>Shouse, <a href="/rawle/5/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Rawle 179" data-case-ids="1824596" data-case-paths="/rawle/5/0179-01">5 <em>Rawle </em>179</a>.

The common law responsibility of a carrier may be limited and lessened by agreement, but the exceptions will be strictly interpreted, and it is the duty of a carrier to bring his case clearly within them : Atwood <em>v. </em>Reliance Co., <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%2088" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Watts 88">9 <em>Watts </em>88</a>; Bingham <em>v. </em>Rogers, 6 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>500; Laing <em>v. </em>Calder, 8 <em>Barr </em>479.</p>
