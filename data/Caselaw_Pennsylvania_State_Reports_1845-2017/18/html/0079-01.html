Though this Court has expressed its regret that <em>feme coverts </em>had not a more substantial protection than was afforded them in the manner in which acknowledgments to their deeds were taken and certified by the officers of the law, yet in this there is some protection in the character of the writing and the interposition of the organ or judicial officer of the law to inform her of its contents, and to be assured by inquiry that it was done understandingly and with her free will and consent. A judgment note may be procured to be signed by a wife on the application of the husband in whom she confides, with much more facility than she would affix her name to a deed conveying her lands, which was to be acknowledged before an officer of the law separate and apart from her husband. A judgment note or bond is often brief, and without any prescribed form, in which by law, neither the attestation of witnesses is required or any acknowledgment; the judgments entered on record by the clerk of the Court at any time, and which by fiction of law are the judgments of the Court, though they have not had any consideration of the Court or their knowledge, are now in practice multiplied to an unlimited extent. In the opinion of this Court, the protection of <em>feme coverts </em>in their rights of property requires that such obligations signed by married women and the judgments and proceedings thereon to sell their real estate, be deemed without authority and void ; and that a sheriff’s sale founded thereon will not divest their estates.</p>
    <p id="b86-6" data-blocks='[["BL_86.4",86,[308,1695,1165,292]]]'>James Caldwell, one of the defendants, derives title under a deed from Elizabeth Stewart, the purchaser at sheriff’s sale; and as her title and the nature of it were disclosed by the sheriff’s deed, and the record on which it was founded, he is a purchaser with notice, and has no protection beyond that of his grantor. It is not to be overlooked that the consideration expressed in the deed of Elizabeth Stewart to him is but one dollar.</p>
    <p id="b86-7" data-blocks='[["BL_86.5",86,[307,1996,1161,431]],["BL_87.1",87,[179,431,1167,291]]]'>It was made a point by the defendants below, that the plaintiff could not recover in this action without a tender of her share of the purchase-money paid the Commonwealth to obtain a patent for the land. In answer to this point, the Court, in their charge to the jury, expressed the opinion, that there was no privity between the parties; and the getting of the patent was a voluntary ac.t of the defendants, and that it did not interfere with the plaintiff’s right to recover, more than the outstanding title in the Commonwealth would, if no patent had been taken out. In the opinion and charge of the Court on this point, there was no error. The <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>defendant, J. Caldwell, who was the owner of the shares of some of the other heirs of D. McDonnel, having elected of his own accord to obtain that patent, without the privity or assent of the plaintiff, cannot have the advantage of it as a defence against the recovery of possession of the land in this action, whatever remedy he may have for contribution for the money paid for such patent in some other form of action.</p>
    <p id="b87-6" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[178,733,1165,86]]]'>The errors assigned by the plaintiff in error not being sustained, the Judgment of the Court below is affirmed.</p>
