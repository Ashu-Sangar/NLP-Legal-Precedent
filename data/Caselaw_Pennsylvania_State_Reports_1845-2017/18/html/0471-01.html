    <p class="summary" id="b471-9" data-blocks='[["BL_471.8",471,[172,1411,1171,860]]]'>The evidence in the cause showed that the land was originally settled by George Fry about 1800. That he built a house, cleared some land, and lived there until his death, about 1806. He left a widow and one child nine years old, who continued to live upon the land until about 1813, when the widow sold out the improvement right to Peter Burris, who went upon the land and lived there until his death in 1824. In 1825 <em>Peter Yoder </em>married Eleanor, <em>the widow of </em>Burris, and went to live on the land, where the widow and children of Burris then were. On 7th April, 1827, Peter Yoder bought the land from John Stahl and wife, the latter being the only child and heir at law of George Fry, and got a deed for it; and on the 4th June, 1827, he sold and conveyed the land to Benjamin Yoder, the plaintiff below. The possession of Peter Yoder and his family, and of such of the Burris family as remained at home, has been continued up to this day. In 1814, <em>Peter Burris </em>obtained a warrant for the land and had it surveyed, but pursued the matter no further. In 1849 Benjamin Yoder applied for a warrant, and then Peter Yoder was one of his witnesses to prove the settlement, and testified that he had lived on the land as tenant of Benjamin since 1827.</p>

The purchase of Peter Yoder enured for the benefit of the widow’s title. 3. That Peter Yoder had been in possession from 1827 till 1850, and the statute of limitations operated; and 4.

He made a settlement and died on the land. His widow and child continued to live on the land till Burris purchased from the widow of Ery. The latter left the land, took her child with her, and gave the possession to Burris. There is in this no evidence of abandonment.</p>

And when Burris died, and Peter Yoder married his widow and continued the possession of the Burris family, he was continuing a wrong against the heir of Ery. When, therefore, Mrs. Stahl arrived at age and asserted her title as heir of Ery, it would have been wrong for Peter Yoder to resist her claim, either for the Burris family or for himself. Being in conscience bound to abandon a possession wrongfully held, <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>he was not under any kind of obligation to buy in the true title for the benefit of those who, with him, were holding in disregard-of it; and there was nothing to prevent him from buying for himself. When he took the deed'to himself] and then conveyed to Benjamin, he was distinctly asserting a purchase on his own account, and there is no evidence that he ever considered himself as holding for the Burris family. The Court below was therefore right in directing a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>
