By that agreement Irvin leased to Watson &amp; Whitaker for five years, two furnaces with the ore banks, at a rent of 75 tons of pig metal yearly for each furnace, to pay yearly and for the time they were in blast. By the same agreement Irvin sold to said Watson &amp; Whitaker all the personal property at said furnaces for $12,816, to be paid in pig metal, payable in four equal payments, extending to November, 1851.

The Perry furnace was in blast but two months after 7th July, 1849. It was in evidence that before the service of the attachment, Watson, at the Harry furnace, publicly assumed all the debts of the hands and the farmers throughout the country; the hands had ceased work, and collected round the furnace; and said also that he and Whitaker would pay the debts of the Perry furnace.</p>

The judgment of "the plaintiffs for a large Sum, <em>being for a balance of purchase-money of real estate, </em>was nearly ready for execution. Irvin was no doubt desirous of providing for the payment of what was owing by him to the labouring men connected with the establishments, as well as the farmers of the neighbourhood who had furnished provisions. Though this purchase may have been <em>bond fide </em>on the part of Watson &amp; Whitaker, and' the intentions of Irvin honest, yet the circumstance of his indebtedness, and an appropriation of his effects in a way that prefers one class of creditors to the postponement and prejudice of others, exposed this sale and agreement to Strong legal exception.</p>

It is aflirmed and adopted to enure to the use of the plaintiff, so far as anything might be due or receivable by Irvin by virtue of its provisions. In the construction of this contract of sale, as between the parties to this action, it is to be considered free from all imputation of fraud, actual or legal. Irvin having sold his property to Watson <a id="p100" href="#p100" data-label="100" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*100</a>&amp; Whitaker at a price agreed upon, might agree to accept, in payment of that price, his liabilities to any debtors or any class of debtors. They are to assume and to pay whatever domestic debts or liabilities of said Irvin they may think proper, and to be allowed for the same. Watson &amp; Whitaker were- not limited in time in making these assumptions and payments, further, we think, than the time given for the payment of the purchase-money by instalments. At the issuing of the attachment execution in this case, but two weeks had expired from the date of their contract with Irvin. Watson &amp; Whitaker were accountable to Irvin if they did not assume and pay to the creditors described to the amount of their purchase-money; and to the same extent they would be accountable to the plaintiffs, who by their attachment succeeded to the rights of Irvin, for anything payable beyond the amount of such debts assumed.</p>

In this answer we do not perceive any error. The defendants had the right to defend on the assumption made, and on the right to assume, since the service of said writ. All that Irvin would have the right to recover was the balance of any of the payments as they became due that had not been appropriated to the class of creditors described, and the attaching creditor had no greater rights.</p>
