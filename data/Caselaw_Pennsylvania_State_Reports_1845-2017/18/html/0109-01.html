The cause was tried at June Term, 1850, and a verdict and judgment rendered in favor of the defendant. The 45 acres, contained in the whole piece of land, belonged to John Hesson, who lived on it and died intestate, leaving issue ten children, to whom the land descended. In 1845, Button, the plaintiff, as the surety of Christina Hesson, onq of the ten children of the said John Hesson, deceased, paid for her the amount of a note, which she owed for medical services, &amp;c., by which she became indebted to him to the amount so paid. On the 13th day of March, 1848, he obtained a judgment against the said Christina Hesson, before a justice of the peace, for the sum of $23.72, being the amount with interest, paid as aforesaid by the plaintiff for her, as her bail, in the note and costs of suit. Execution was issued by <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>the justice on this judgment, and the constable to whom the same was delivered, made return of <em>“no </em>goods, <em>no chattels found.” </em>On the 15th of April, 1848, a transcript of this judgment was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Beaver county, andji. <em>fa. </em>No. 6, June Term, 1848, was issued thereon, levy made by virtue thereof on the interest of the said Christina Hesson in the said 45 acres of land. <em>Vend. exp. </em>issued to Sept. Term, 1848, and the property was sold by the sheriff to Thomas Lutton, the plaintiff, and a deed therefor was made and duly acknowledged by the sheriff, for the same, to said Lutton, bearing date September 1, 1848.</p>

There is a class of cases, it is true, in which the receipt on the deed is no evidence of the payment of the consideration-money, hut this is not a case of that description: Union Canal Company <em>v. </em>Young et al., <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Whart.%20432" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Whart. 432">1 <em>Wharton </em>432</a>; Bolton <em>v. </em>Johns, 5 <em>Barr </em>145. Thus, where fraud is proved between the original vendor and vendee, and a third person to whom the estate is conveyed claims title as a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser, for a valuable consideration, without notice, the purchaser is put to proof of the payment of the purchase-money <em>aliunde </em>the receipt on the deed. In such and similar cases, the receipt on the deed is no evidence. It would, as is justly remarked, render title very insecure, if all that is necessary to entitle the plaintiff in ejectment to recover, is for him to allege that the deed, under which the defendant claims, is voluntary and fraudulent, unless the vendee proves that the consideration-money mentioned in the deed is paid.</p>
