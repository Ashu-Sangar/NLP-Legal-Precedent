But the patents to Dugan, given in evidence, refer to the date of the deeds poll for the lands, and describe the several tracts as adjoining the Martin, Wilson, and Lesher surveys, respectively. We cannot therefore say, that the facts in evidence raise a presumption that the Dugan patents do not relate to the land called for by the warrants surveyed 5th January, 1795. It is submitted as a question for the jury.</p>

A chamber survey, duly returned, if it can be located with reasonable certainty may vest title, especially after the lapse of 21 years without being controverted. In such case the presumption is conclusive that the survey was regularly made. The warrant of Henry Feather bears date 27th February, 1818, more than 21 years after the return of survey of Sophia Myer; if correctly located where the plaintiffs claim it to be, the law implies that it was regularly made; whether it is thus located is a question for the jury.</p>

It appears from the blotters and vouchers in the land office, and the day-book of the Deceiver General, that this warrant, and thirty-five others, were paid for by the application of credits, which Peter Benson had on the books of the office for lost warrants surrendered. The plaintiffs claim under Benson, -whose heirs, on the 18th of April, 1838, conveyed the Sophia Myer tract and five others, on which the purchase-money was paid by their father, at the same time, and in the same way, to Henry K. Strong, for the consideration of $1 and services rendered. Mr. Strong conveyed certain undivided parts to the other plaintiffs. There was also a third title given in evidence under a warrant to Henry Feather, dated in 1818; but being of no value in itself, and having no influence on the rights of the parties who claim under Benson or Dugan, it is not necessary to notice it.</p>

John Keble’s blotter, and other books in the land office, show, that Benson was charged with the price of this warrant, and that he paid it. This blotter was never considered a record; and certified copies were not admitted in evidence, until the act of'1823 was passed for that purpose: <em>Purdon </em>427. Previously to that time the entries were proved and admitted as private papers : <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20112" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="8 Watts 112">8 <em>Watts </em>112</a>. The Act of Assembly did not change their nature as evidence, but only furnished a more convenient means of getting them before Courts and juries. They were admitted before and since 1823, apparently upon the rule which admits other private memoranda of deceased persons in evidence, where they were against the interest of the persons making them. But long experience of their accuracy has given them a credit which no other unofficial books have received in our Courts. Still they constitute but parol evidence, and are not conclusive proof of anything. That warrants were frequently said by those books to have been paid for by persons who did not actually advance the money, except as agents, no one can doubt; and the fact has been often proved. The defendants attempted to prove it here. They showed that Benson was a clerk in the land office. Clerks were at that time in the habit of acting as agents to an extent which grew into a great evil; and the year afterwards a law was passed to forbid them: <em>Purdon </em>732. One aged witness was called, who remembered Benson, and knew that he transacted more business as agent than any of the other clerks. He died in 1801, leaving scarcely any personal property. He paid the purchase-money on a great number of other warrants, without afterwards perfecting the titles. The certificate of the Receiver General, that the purchase-money was paid on the Sophia Myer warrant, was in the usual form, without any mention of Benson’s name, and does not appear ever to have been in his possession, but was found among certain title papers which John Myer had delivered to Pott and Boyer. John Myer, and not Benson, handed in the application for the Sophia Myer and nine other tracts, on all of which the purchase-money is <a id="p298" href="#p298" data-label="298" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*298</a>marked in the blotter as paid by Benson; but on none of them did he ever take out, or apply for patents.

He claims an estate in land, not only without a deed, but in opposition to the written title. Records and deeds are not easily overthrown, as is manifest enough from the stringent rules which this Court has often laid down, in cases of parol sales. The whole doctrine of resulting trusts is a violation of the sound principles on which the statute of frauds is based, and ought not to be favored, except when the trust originated in the bad faith of the nominal purchaser. The extension of it to cases in which the <em>cestui que trust </em>has voluntarily placed his rights in such a condition that he can only establish them by parol, is of doubtful policy; and, like other departures from the statute of frauds, has probably done more mischief than it has ever corrected. Eor these reasons it is more than doubtful, if any chancellor, upon the evidence which this case presents, would decree specific execution of the trust, supposing the facts to be recent, and time no element in the decision. It may be, indeed, that the frequent use which was made in early times of the names of persons as warrantees, who were not the real owners, for the purpose of evading the laws against engrossing the public lands, entitles this peculiar kind of trust to more than ordinary favor. Certain it is, that the blotter has been allowed to decide very many disputes in favor of the person by whom it showed the money to have been paid; but never, in any case that I know of, where the evidence of agency was as strong as it is here. ■</p>

The defendants insist, that the great length of time which elapsed after the date of the warrant, and before any claim was made under Benson, raises a presumption of law, which is conclusive against the title derived from him. It is true, that the transaction which creates the contest between these parties, is entirely too old to be investigated now, with the slightest hope of ascertaining the truth. It is impossible for us to feel any confidence in the evidence which can be furnished by men of these times concerning occurrences so remote. Fifty-two years went round between the time when the purchase-money for this land was paid, and the bringing of the present suit. During all that time, neither Benson, nor his heirs, nor anybody else deriving title from him, made any claim to the land; nor paid taxes for it; nor exercised any act of ownership over it; nor manifested the least sign of consciousness that they had a title to it. We are now asked to determine the rights of the parties, on such facts as can be fished up from the oblivion of more than half a century. Nearly two generations have lived on <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>the earth, and been buried in its bosom, since this business was transacted. Of the men who were then in active life, and capable of being witnesses, not one in twenty thousand is now living. Written documents, whose production might have settled this dispute instantly, have been, in all human probability, destroyed, or lost, or thrown away as useless. The matter belongs to a past age, of which we can have no knowledge, except what we derive from history, through whose medium we can dimly discern the outlines of great public events, but all that pertains to men’s private affairs is wholly invisible, or only visible in such a sort as to confound the sense and mislead the judgment. “ No man,” says Mr. Justice Sergeant (<a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20115" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Watts 115">2 <em>Watts </em>115</a>), “ ought to be permitted to lie by while his rights can be fairly investigated and justly determined, until time has involved them in uncertainty and obscurity, and then ask for an inquiry.” For such reasons as these it is, that every civilized society has fixed a limited time, within which all rights must be prosecuted. Where this is not done by positive enactment of the legislature, the judiciary calls in the aid of presumption; and Courts of equity, though not bound by the statutes of limitation, close their doors against stale demands, as sternly as the Courts of law.</p>

These questions, like others, are disposed of according to the legal presump<a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>tions which arise from' the lapse of time.

But it must be remembered that the conveyance of the warrantee, and the patent from the Commonwealth, gave him the legal title, and he was in possession by. construction of law. Actual possession would not have made his right any stronger, as against another claimant, who was not himself in possession. Ilis title, on the face of it, was as perfect. as it could be made. He needed no judgment or decree of any Court to make it better. It was not necessary or possible for him to bring suit against Benson or his heirs or alienees, to establish that his legal estate was free from the trust, which the plaintiffs assert it was charged with. His non-payment of taxe3 is proof that he was not a very good citizen; but that is a default for which his title could only be divested by a treasurer’s sale.

The answer is, that they might have taken possession of the premises, and compelled the other party to commence proceedings. They reply that possession ought not to be required, because the land is not fit for cultivation, and the coal has been but recently discovered.

VIII); that he or his heirs became invested with the legal title, as soon as the patent passed it from the Commonwealth; that having the legal title they were constructively in possession; and that the presumption from lapse of time is, therefore, not against them, but in their favor. The inferences are logically drawn, but the premises are not true. An implied trust is not within the statute of uses. Where the use is expressly and immediately limited on the legal estate, it will be executed in the <em>cestui que use. </em>But a use •limited on a use will not be. (22 <em>Vin. Abr. </em>268). Where the trust is expressed in the deed which creates the legal estate, the trustee cannot set up the statute of limitations, either at law or in equity, against his <em>cestui que </em>trust, any more than, a tenant for years, can do so against his landlord, and for the same reason; namely, because it would be claiming in opposition to the title, by which he himself holds. But here the warrant, deed poll, and patent, purport to give Dugan the legal, as well as the equitable title, for his own use, and that of his heirs and assigns. They do not on their face require him to hold it for the use of Benson.
