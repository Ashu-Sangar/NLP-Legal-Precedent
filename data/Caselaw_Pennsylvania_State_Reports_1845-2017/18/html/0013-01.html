    <p class="summary" id="b13-18" data-blocks='[["BL_13.10",13,[164,1892,1164,474]]]'>This was an action in the name of David Calhoun and James Leech, surviving Robert Curry and Samuel Hamilton, members of the building committee of the Mifflin township meeting-house, against William Chambers. A case was stated, in which it was submitted, that a meeting of the congregation of the Associate Reformed Church of Mifflin township, Allegheny county (an unincorporated religious association), was held in 1842, at which it was resolved that a new house of worship should be built. William Chambers, the defendant below, and plaintiff in error, was there, a member; and in order to enable them to build the church, he signed a paper, viz.:</p>

Such committee was composed of William Chambers the defendant, Leech and Calhoun, the plaintiffs in this case, and two others, who were dead when this suit was brought. The committee proceeded with the building, and it was completed. Chambers paid $125 on account of his subscription. This action was brought by the surviving members of the committee, exclusive of Chambers himself, to recover from him the balance.</p>

Why should we higgle about technical eongruity, after the very first step has been a departure from all eongruity? The object is to compel <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>the promissor to pay; and any means that can produce that effect, may be resorted to in order to prevent a failure of justice. The action ought to he supported whether the promissor were joined as a plaintiff or not; his name could at most be surplusage; but as no one is legally hound by a promise to himself, the contract in this ease was in part void, but good for the residue, and' the name of the promissor was properly dropped as that of a plaintiff; at least it lessened the appearance, of irregularity.</p>

Though <em>functi officio </em>as to that, they were still trustees for the recovery of this debt. It is of no importance that another committee had been raised to “ wait on William Chambers in reference to his obligation.” Even had the congregation desired to transfer this chose in action to another committee, so as to enable them to sue in their own names, it could not have done so: and the only course was to sue in the names of the surviving members of the original committee.</p>
