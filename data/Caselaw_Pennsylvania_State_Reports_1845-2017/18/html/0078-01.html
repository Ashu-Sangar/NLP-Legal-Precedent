Before the justice the defendant denied that plaintiffs had any legal claim against him, and claimed a set-off for $99. The plaintiffs asked for an adjournment for want of witnesses, which was granted. Both parties appeared before the justice on the day to which the ease had been adjourned, and judgment was rendered for the plaintiff for $1.11..</p>

In cases of this kind, it is the demand, and not the amount of the judgment, which determines the right of appeal. For this we refer to the cases of Stewart <em>v. </em>Keemle, 4 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>72; Klinginsmith <em>v. </em>Nole, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Pa.%20119" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Pa. 119">3 <em>Penn.

As we may not look at them when the Common Pleas has decided on them, we are. bound to presume that the decision is right. By the record in this case it is shown that the parties appeared before the justice, and that the defendant claimed a set-off beyond the limit of the justice’s final jurisdiction. The plaintiff craved an adjournment, and had it; and, at the day of hearing, judgment was given for him. The objection to the appeal in the Common Pleas was, that the set-off was a sham to get round the finality of the justice’s jurisdiction of the plaintiff’s demand; and the court, having heard affidavits it was bound to receive, determined that,the fact was so. Shall we who dare not touch them, say otherwise ? The decision was doubtless right; but right or wrong, we cannot review it.</p>
