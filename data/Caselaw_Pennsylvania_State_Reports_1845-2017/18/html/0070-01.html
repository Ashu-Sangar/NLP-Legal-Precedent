The following case was stated for the opinion of the Court, viz.: Plaintiff got a warrant and survey under the Act of 11th April, 1848, to encourage the further development of the mineral resources of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania; defendant afterwards took $10 worth of sand from the bed of the river Monongahela, within the bounds of plaintiff’s survey; whereupon plaintiff brought this action for damages.

A right to dig for minerals is essentially different from a right to the soil. Nothing is more common in every part of the state where coal or iron abounds, than a right to dig for it below the surface of the ground, separated from a right to the surface itself. A grant of it conveys no more than a license to take and appropriate the minerals beneath; but it vests no property in them till they are taken and appropriated. The plaintiff had no better right, therefore, than had the defendant, to the sand deposited by the current; or rather the right to it was exclusively in the state. True, it is said in the third section of the Act, that the warrantee may receive “ a patent for the <em>land;" </em>but the generality of the expression is qualified by directing that the patent contains only a grant to dig and mine. The subsequent Act, more distinctly restraining the generality of the terms, was unnecessary, and we are therefore relieved from a consideration of its constitutionality.</p>
