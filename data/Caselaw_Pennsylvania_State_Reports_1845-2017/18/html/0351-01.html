Two persons were engaged as partners in purchasing and selling cattle, and the residue of the cattle after sales made were agreed to be taken by one of the partners at a stipulated price per head. The partners had a settlement of the partnership accounts, and a division of the assets was made. A note of a debtor of the firm, for cattle sold to hiru, had been endorsed in the name of the firm to one of the partners, the plaintiff in the action, and by him to a bank, by which it had been discounted, and the proceeds had been applied to the business of the partnership. The debtor failed to pay, and the partner who had it discounted paid its amount to the bank, and afterwards brought an action of account render against the other partner for contribution. It was <em>held, </em>that nothing short of an agreement mutually releasing each other from liability for the note would produce that effect, and in the absence of such proof, the defendant was liable to contribution.</p>

The parties had been partners in the purchase and sale of cattle. Most of the cattle had been sold; seventy-five of them to George Heller, who gave his note, payable to the firm, for $2863.77, dated 11th July, 1849, and payable in twenty days from date. On the 19th July, 1849, Kelly agreed to take the residue of the cattle at $28 per head. The note of Heller, with the firm endorsement, was received by Kelly, who endorsed it, and had it discounted at the Lancaster County Bank, and the proceeds were applied by him to the credit of the partnership. <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>On the 19th July, the partners had a settlement of the partnership accounts, made, it was alleged, in order to ascertain the profit from their operations, and the notes belonging to the firm were divided between the parties. At what time the note of Heller was discounted, or when it was endorsed in the firm name, was not stated on the paper-books. Heller failed to pay his note, and Kelly settled it with the bank, and brought this action of account render against Kauffman to require him to account for his share of the loss on the note.</p>

But if the declaration of Kelly, as stated by Bausman, had relation only to the purchase of Kauffman’s interest in the cattle then unsold, and not to the purchase of his interest in the debts due to the parties for cattle previously sold, this purchase would not be a bar to the action.</p>

A settlement of the accounts, and a division of the partnership assets, does not discharge the parties from their mutual obligations to contribute to •losses which may subsequently arise from circumstances not anticipated at the time of the settlement. Nothing short of an agreement mutually releasing each other from such liability will produce that effect; and this was the substance of the instructions given below. But on a careful consideration of the evidence relied upon to establish this agreement, we are of opinion that it had relation only to a division of the partnership assets, and not to the question of ultimate liability for losses not anticipated at the time. The note of George Heller was by its terms, made payable to Patrick Kelly &amp; Co., and could not be negotiated without an endorsement of the firm, which would render both parties liable to the holder for its amount, upon non-payment at maturity and due notice of the default. The transfer of the note to Kelly carried with it the right to dispose of it in the usual wray, by an endorsement which involved the credit and liability of both partners. An agreement <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>which thus continued the liability of the firm, would, of itself, he suggestive of the propriety of an equally explicit engagement, that, as between themselves, the whole loss which might thus accrue should fall only upon one, if such was their understanding of the terms of the settlement. The absence of an express provision to this effect gives strength to the conclusion that the question of ultimate liability for losses which might accrue by reason of a failure to recover the claims that were divided, was not the subject of consideration or agreement. The original liability, by virtue of the contract of partnership, was discharged neither by the settlement, nor by the conversation which took place at the time. There was therefore error in permitting the jury to infer an agreement by Kelly to take the note at his own risk, from circumstances which did not justify such a conclusion. Eor this cause the judgment is to be reversed. We perceive no other error in the instructions and proceedings of the Court below.</p>
