Manchester in the vicinity of Pittsburgh, and the moon in the vicinity of 'the earth, when compared with planets more remote. Yicinity, when applied to a practical matter, might very readily cause disagreement in honest minds; for, in the matter in hand, vicinity is not a matter of eyesight only, but for the judgment also.</p>
    <p id="b32-6" data-blocks='[["BL_32.4",32,[330,986,1164,899]]]'>It has been said in argument, by way of illustration, that if upon inquiry in a cry of fire we were told it was on Wood street at the Monongahela wharf, we would not run to Irwins’ alley. This is true, but if Hancock street is opened, Wood street is extended from river to river (which is not the case with any other street in the city), and if we were then informed of a fire on Wood street, at the Allegheny wharf, what was Irwins’ alley is the first place we would run to. The mouth of Wood street on Liberty is now in the immediate vicinity of Irwins’ alley, and so soon as that is opened, by whatever name it may be called, it is but a -continuation of Wood street, and when the viewers by their assessments on property down Wood to Water street, practically say that these lots are in the vicinity of Irwins’ alley, they only say that- Wood street is in the vicinity of Wood street. Indeed some lots in the immediate vicinity of Irwins’ alley were not assessed at all, owing pei’haps to their closer proximity to Irwin <em>street </em>than Irwins’ <em>alley, </em>and these would probably receive more injury than benefit from the proposed extension. The words of the Act are, they shall ascertain and determine “what lots in the vicinity of said extension will probably be benefited, and divide and apportion on equitable principles, &amp;e.”</p>

      <em>Exceptions 5th and 6th </em>are not specific but general, and complain of error and irregularity, without showing wherein it consists.</p>
    <p id="b32-8" data-blocks='[["BL_32.6",32,[331,2014,1161,343]]]'>We have compared this report with the law, and find it remarkable for its exemption from errors and irregularities, and can find no deviation from prescribed duty, or usurpation of authority not conferred in it. These viewers were not appointed until after due reflection by the Court; they are men whom the Court personally knew to be of great experience; men of business-capacity and integrity, and the counsel of remonstrants have not hesitated so to say in their arguments repeatedly.</p>

Howe, whose written dissent is only partial. The viewers are required to say what lots will “ probably” be benefited, thus leaving a margin to relieve in a degree the exercise of their judgment.</p>
    <p id="b33-5" data-blocks='[["BL_33.4",33,[177,613,1167,426]]]'>Now, what is the duty of the Court? Is this Court, if its judgment should vary from that of the viewers, are we, by a stroke of the pen, to set at nought all their proceedings, and those proceedings under the sanction of their oaths ? Such is not our duty nor our desire. The law confers powers and responsibilities on them, and if they have carried out the spirit of the law, we can find no fault with their proceedings. Whether this lot was assessed too much, or that too little; whether a lot in the immediate vicinity was not taxed at all, or one remoter was assessed, was their business, not ours.</p>

The cautious phraseology of the Act shows that the legislature was aware of the delicate nature of the duty it imposed upon the viewers.</p>
