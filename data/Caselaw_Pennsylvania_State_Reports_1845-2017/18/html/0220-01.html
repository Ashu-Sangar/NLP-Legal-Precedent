There is a building on Francis Weand’s land, on the Swamp road; it is on the land along which this road passes. There are buildings on David Gilbert’s land, on the Swamp road; the new road passes along Gilbert’s land.

I then make a copy of it, and attach it t.o the report. The draft I retain is a rough draft.

The houses of Francis Weand and Amos Knouse are noted on the first draft and not on the last, and the Reformed church is noted on the first and not on the last. Neither do the courses and distances on the two drafts correspond. On the first draft the distance of a certain course along and through the land of Greo. Richards is said to be 105 perches and five-tenths, while on the last the same course appears to be 111 perches and five-tenths.

In most cases the improvements and the nature of the land, whether arable or woodland, and the streams and meadows, are noted on the draft. They are all more conveniently described in a draft than in the report. The jury never saw the draft. They gave the surveyor no authority to attach it, and hence the report should have been set aside, and not affirmed by the Court of Quarter Sessions.</p>

They approved of it, made their report of a road agreeing with the draft, signed the report, and left the report and draft in the hands of the surveyor to forward to the Court.

The presumption in this Court is that all things are right. Rut this exception is something worse than an unproved one.

There is nothing in this. The draft may be appended by any person whom the viewers authorize to do so. The courses and distances are given in the report, and if the draft varies from them it can easily be corrected. If there should bo a serious omission in it, the universal and proper practice is to recommit it to the viewers for such alterations as will make it perfect. The reason why it was not referred back in the present case, was (as we are bound to believe), that the Court knew it to be right as it stood.</p>
