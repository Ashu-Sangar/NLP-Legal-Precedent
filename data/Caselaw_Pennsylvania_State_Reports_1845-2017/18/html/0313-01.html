Cook, as administrator of his estate, without submitting an administration account on the estate of John Cook, had transferred to himself, he claiming them as the only heir to his father, the said John Cook. It was admitted that the stocks had come to the possession or control of the defendant. On the 19th October, 1847, John Cook died. On 26th October, 1847, a paper, bearing date 22d February, 1845, purporting to be his last will, was presented for probate, but the Register refused to admit it to probate.</p>

Subsequently another paper, purporting to be the last will of <em>John </em>Cook, was presented to the Register, who refused to admit it to probate, but on appeal a verdict was rendered in the Common Pleas <em>in favor of the will. </em>By this will John Cook bequeathed certain legacies, and devised the residue of his estate to his wife, and subject to her disposal by will, and to her heirs and assigns. He nominated his son W. W. Cook, and his wife, to be the executors. Rebecca, his wife, died in the lifetime of the testator, leaving an only child, the said William W. Cook. William W. Cook, by his will, bequeathed certain annuities, and also some legacies; the residue of his estate and any accumulation -was to be passed over, at the time stated in the will, to the “Blind Asylum, and Pennsylvania Hospital, or to the directors or managers thereof, in equal and undivided portions.” Some or all of the stocks which were transferred by W.

The Orphans’ Court is the forum for settling the accounts of the administrator; and it is there that the surplus of the assets, after payment of debts, is to be ascertained, and distribution decreed to the parties entitled. In the mean time, the proper personal representative is entitled to the possession of the personal estate. It was the duty of W. W. Cook to have settled his administration account in that Court before he could legally convert the assets to his own use; and if this action was brought before he had time to file his account, he or his representative might have obtained a stay of the present proceeding, on filing his account afterwards, according to the provisions of the section already cited.</p>
