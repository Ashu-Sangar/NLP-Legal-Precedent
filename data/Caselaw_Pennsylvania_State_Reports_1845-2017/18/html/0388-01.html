It would be a great injury to persons in embarrassed circumstances holding such paper; for no one could buy it from them with any confidence in the title. Moreover, it would present the strange result, that the more hands such paper had passed through, and the more endorsers there were on it, the less it would be worth in the money market: for it would be subject to the more risks of attachment.
