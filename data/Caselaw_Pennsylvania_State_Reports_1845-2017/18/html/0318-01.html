      <em>Qui hceret in litera hceret in cortiee, </em>is a caution that applies in all cases of construction, and means that that is a shallow interpretation-which sacrifices the general intent to a mere verbal criticism. , Yet, a,s it is only through words that we can reach any intent, whether general or special, they cannot be assumed to be inaccurate, except in deference to an ascertained general intent. Yery few writings would bear the criticism of a narrower rule, and we shall certainly fall into the vice of which this proverb warns us, if we adhere to a strict verbal interpretation of the various substitutionary clauses. Eor example, the will says, that each share shall go over, on a legatee dying “without leaving children,” when it is clearly meant, “ without leaving children living at the time fixed for distribution.” Otherwise, on such a death, the share would fully and finally vest in such children, and could not be affected by the death of all or any of them. Then we should have the personal representatives of some of the children claiming here some of the shares, though it is manifest that the general intent excludes the personal representatives, and settles the actual distribution according to the state of the survivorship at the death of Mrs. Francis. Even the word “share” will not bear the strict construction contended for on Anne’s behalf; for when John died, his share went to Willing, Thomas, and Anne, and on the death of Willing and Thomas, she would have to claim it through them. In other words, she herself claims an increased share, under the clause giving over the “shares.”</p>

Her meaning would then seem to be that the intended share, whether increased or not, of one dying childless, shall go over, and such intended share of one dying leaving children,, shall go to them.</p>
    <p id="b325-7" data-blocks='[["BL_325.5",325,[167,1006,1173,550]]]'>Again, she declares, that if any one die without children, his share shall go over; to whom ? Why, the case she is supposing requires her to say to the other “brothers and sisters;” for as yet, in her mind, the case of one dying leaving children has not arisen. But next she speaks of this, and declares, “if however” the one who dies shall leave children, they shall have their parent’s share. “ However” is most emphatic here, if we keep up the connection of the thought. It indicates an alternative intention, a contrast with the previous clause, and a modification of it under other circumstances. It is thus — I do not however so dispose of the survivorship in the case of those who die leaving children, but such children shall take the share which their parent, if surviving, would have taken.</p>

By the granting clause an absolute vested interest is given to each legatee, and it is in the limitation clause that we 'find the difficulty. In the first of them, the limitation over is in case of any one dying childless, and it is an obvious corollary of this clause that, if one does not die childless, his children shall take, as in the case of an estate tail; and this thought would naturally be now dismissed from the writer’s mind, before proceeding to the next subject. The last clause of the limitation is mere redundancy, if it only repeats this idea, and the word “however” loses its value. But if this clause stands in the contrast already indicated, it expresses an additional thought, and all the words and clauses have a positive value. Then what share do the children of a deceased legatee take ? Manifestly what their parents would have taken, if living. When she declared that the surviving brothers and sisters should have the accretion, she could not express her whole meaning by simply adding to the clause, “ and the children of those deceased;” for then, besides the thought being out of place, those children would claim <em>per capita </em>and not <em>per stirpes; </em>and therefore she qualified her partially expressed intention as to the survivorship by <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>an additional clause, giving the children of a deceased legatee the right of survivorship which their parent would have had.</p>
