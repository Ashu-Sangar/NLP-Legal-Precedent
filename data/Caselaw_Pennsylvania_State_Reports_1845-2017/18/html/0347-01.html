He was then offered to prove that the alteration was made without the knowledge, privity, or consent of Winfield S. Kennedy, the defendant; and again he was rejected for the same reason. To all which the counsel for defendant excepted. No objection was made that a release by Kennedy to Rambo, as to costs, was not exhibited. It appeared that the note was discounted by the <em>cashier, </em>not by the directors; and that the regular discount day was on Thursday, the <em>fifteenth </em>August. It appeared, however, that the cashier, previous to the discounting of this note, had received authority from the directors to discount a certain description of drafts or notes on other days than regular discount days; and that the note in question was of the description allowed to be discounted by the cashier; and that the discount of it was, on the following Thursday, approved by the board of directors.</p>

If the witness was rejected on this ground, there was error. The case started with the legal presumption that the true note had been altered, and the witness was offered, not to impeach it in the aspect in which the law views it, but to rebut the evidence of others who present it in a different aspect. The presumption that a note has been altered sets aside the presumption of its regular negotiation, and admits the parties to testify, if not interested.</p>
