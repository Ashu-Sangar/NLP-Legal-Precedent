The respondent answers, first, the statute of limitations, and second, that the partnership was settled, and the defendants’ testator paid his share. A chancellor applies the statute of limitation, with the same substantial effect that it receives in a court of law. There is no reason why disputes should be kept up on fact in equity, after the law has put its quietus upon them. The question then is, did the statute apply ? The usual remedy' at law between partners is the action of account render, unless there be a covenant, or express promise, or mutual settlement, after dissolution. Whenever a complete cause of action exists, then the statute begins to run, not always from the time of the promise or contract, but from the time the cause of action accrued.</p>
    <p id="b22-9" data-blocks='[["BL_22.11",22,[339,1417,1160,473]]]'>If the liability depends on a contingency, then the contingency must happen before the statute runs, or if damages accrue from negligence or misfeasance, then the statute runs from the time of the act creating the liability, and not from the happening of the damages consequent on the act. According to the bill, the decedent received the whole of the sum due on the adventure, after the work was finished, and the job ended ; this he had a right to do, and by doing it he made himself debtor to the orator for his share. At that time the orator had a right of action against the testator of respondents, and from that time the statute began to run: 2 <em>W. C. C. R. </em>212, Hourquebies <em>v. </em>Girard.</p>
    <p id="b22-10" data-blocks='[["BL_22.12",22,[340,1890,1159,342]]]'>This adventure or contract was a single transaction, for a stipulated price; and one partner having received the whole of the price, the action of assumpsit would lie by the other partner concerned in the adventure, for his share; it was not necessary to resort to the action of account render. This principle was fully asserted and ruled in Galbraith <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/watts/2/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Watts 86" data-case-ids="1840166" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0086-01">2 <em>Watts </em>86</a>.

In addition to the positive testimony on the subject, the lapse of time affords strong corroboration of the fact. A factor, who has received goods on consignment, is bound <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>to pay over the proceeds and the merchandise not sold on demand; and an action for not accounting does not lie until a demand be made, and from that time the statute runs.</p>
