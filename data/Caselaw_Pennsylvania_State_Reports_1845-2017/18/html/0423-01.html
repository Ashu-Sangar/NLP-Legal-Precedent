Some years after the payment to the husband, the estate of the testator became reduced by the recovery of judgment on an administration <em>bond, in </em>which he was a joint surety. The husband afterwards died insolvent. After his death the wife became entitled to a share of the proceeds of sale of certain <em>real </em>estate which had been devised by her father to her sister for life, and after her death without children, to the other children of the testator, with power to the executors to make sale of the same. It was <em>held, </em>that the personal representative of the executor who made payment to the husband, was not entitled to reimbursement for the amount overpaid to the husband, out of the wife’s share of the <em>real </em>estate which accrued to her after the death of her husband, but that the same was payable to the wife.</p>

      <em>Martin Weiser </em>died in 1822, and letters testamentary were, on the 5th of November of the same year, granted to his sons, John and <em>Martin J, Weiser, </em>whom he appointed executors. John never acted until after the death of Martin J. On the 25th of July, 1823, Martin J. Weiser, the acting executor of Martin Weiser, filed his administration account, the balance on which he distributed among the heirs. This balance consisted of <em>personal estate </em>of which the testator made no disposition in his will, and which went to his children in equal shares. On the 23d of October, 1823, John Yost, the husband of Catharine Yost, who was one of the daughters and heirs of Martin Weiser, in consideration of the payment of $357.22, for his “ dividend share of the personal estate, as far as the same is settled, of Martin Weiser, deceased,” executed a release to Martin J. Weiser, as acting <em>executor; </em>and covenanted <a id="p424" href="#p424" data-label="424" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*424</a>to refund a proportionate part of any debt or demand that might thereafter be recovered against the estate. The amount thus paid to the husband of Catharine Yost,, was <em>more than her full share of the whole estate, </em>as reduced by a subsequently recovered debt. To November Term, 1832, a judgment was recovered against the estate of Martin Weiser, the testator, for $2214.26, on an administration bond, in which he Was surety. The one half of this judgment was paid by the other surety; and Martin J. Weiser paid the other half, $1107.13, for which he had no funds of the estate in hand. Some of the heirs refunded; but the husband of Catharine Yost was insolvent and could not. He <em>subsequently </em>died insolvent, and left his wife to survive him.</p>

This sum they paid to the husband of Catharine, taking his release, and a covenant to refund his proportion of what might be needed to pay debts. A debt was afterwards recovered, which Martin J. Weiser, one of the executors, paid out of his own pocket. Yost was insolvent, and did not refund. The testator had devised to his daughter Lydia, certain real property for life, and in case of her death without issue, it was to revert to his sons and daughter, and be equally divided between them. Lydia did die without issue, and Martin J. Weiser having also died, the surviving executor sold the real property mentioned, and brought the proceeds into Court, where it was distributed among all the children. But the executrix of Martin J. Weiser claims the share of Mrs. Yost, by way of making his estate whole for the sum overpaid to and never refunded by Yost, who is also dead.</p>

All this does not amount to a payment of the wife’s share of the other fund. It is plain that neither she, nor her husband, nor the executor, meant the payment of her share of the personal property as a payment of her interest in the real estate. It was not intended to be a reduction of it into possession by the husband, nor was it an actual reduction. Why should the law presume that the parties did that which they neither did nor thought of ? What is there here to make it necessary that we should treat the transaction otherwise than according to its real import ? The husband claimed the wife’s share of the balance then in the executor’s hands, and got it; got, if you please, more than he was entitled to; but all he received was paid him on that score alone. He did not meddle <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>with the interest she would have after her sister’s death, nor touch it. As the law then stood, he might, perhaps, have pledged it, to make good his refunding contract, just as he could .have pledged it for any other liability; though that is more than doubtful, for it was then a contingent interest in real property. But he did not do so.</p>
