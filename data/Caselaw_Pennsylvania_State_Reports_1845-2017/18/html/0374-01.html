Inadequacy of price may be so gross as to be evidence of mistake or fraud, but the mere offer of one of the other heirs to give more for the property than the sum at which it was appraised, is not a sufficient reason for refusing to permit the eldest son to take it at the valuation, and for setting aside the inquisition.</p>

A valuation of the land at a grossly inadequate price, may be evidence of mistake or fraud. But there is nothing here which shows, with ■ any degree of certainty, that the land was valued at less than a fair price. The preponderance of the evidence is greatly in favor of the opinion that the price fixed on it by the jury was about the true one.</p>

There are many reasons why such an offer should not be listened to. If a fair appraisement has been made, and the eldest son is willing to take it, it is his right to have it; and that right cannot be defeated by another heir who thinks he can afford to go higher. The law does not put up the estate to the highest bidder among the children of a decedent, but provides a mode of adjusting its value according to the truth, and then at that value offers it to the heirs in a certain prescribed order. This prevents the justice of the distribution from being disturbed by their rivalry, ignorance, errors, or caprices, and gives no unfair advantage to one who is rich over another who is less able to compete with him.</p>
