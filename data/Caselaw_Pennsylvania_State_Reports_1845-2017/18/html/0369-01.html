On a partition, in the Common Pleas, of Jacob Brenneman’s estate, in 1833, Michael Brenneman, one of his sons, accepted it at the appraisement, subject, it is presumed (although the case does not state the fact), to the payment of the interest on the widow’s share, during her life, and the principal to the parties entitled, at her death. Michael Brenneman’s share of the principal was, of course, paid by operation of law upon his accepting the estate. His interest became an <em>estate </em>in the <em>land, </em>not a <em>lien </em>for the <em>money. </em>In 1816, Michael Brenneman’s interest was sold by the sheriff to Christian Stehman, who, in 1824, conveyed to John Erb; and, in 1843, Erb’s interest was sold by the sheriff to Thomas Huston, the plaintiff, who, in 1844, conveyed to the defendant, ‘in consideration of $3113.33, and excepting and reserving a dower of $6186.67,’ ‘ subject to the payment of said <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>dower, by said Isaac Erb, or tbe person holding said property, of $6186.67; the interest of said sum to be paid in every year’ <em>‘ </em>unto Catharine Brenneman, formerly widow of Jacob Brenneman, said Catharine now intermarried with said Thomas Huston, during her natural life, and at her death the said principal of dower to be paid to the <em>heirs and legal representatives </em>of the said Jacob Brenneman, deceased, according to law, and the proceedings upon record of the Court of said county in relation to the same.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b371-6" data-blocks='[["BL_371.4",371,[158,814,1170,1202]]]'>“ It is plain that at the time of the sale by Thomas Huston to Erb, the defendant, the share of Michael Brenneman in the principal sum of $6186.67, set apart for the widow, was extinguished, and existed only as an estate in the land. It is also clear that Thomas Huston was the owner of that interest, and was not bound, in law or equity, to pay out, upon the death of the widow, any portion of the money in satisfaction of Michael Brenneman’s interest. He represented that interest himself, and was entitled to enjoy it. The fair construction of the deed shows that the sum of $1237.33 was left in the hands of the^ defendant, being part of the consideration money to be paid by him to <em>some one </em>at the widow’s death, and that this sum is expressly charged on the land. To whom is this money payable <em>1 </em>Michael Brenneman might be considered as an heir and legal representative of Jacob Brenneman; but, from what has been said, it is apparent that he has no claim in iaw or equity to the money. As his interest in the money was converted into land, and as that land has passed, for a valuable consideration, into the hands of Thomas Huston, it would be against equity to give the money to Michael Brenneman, and thus give him a <em>-second time </em>the value of his interest in the fund set apart for the widow. The equity of the case is with the plaintiff. He was clearly entitled to this money at the time of the conveyance to Erb; because he held all the interest in the land which Michael Brenneman had formerly held. It is not doing violence to the words of the reservation, to hold that Thomas Huston is, ‘ according to law, and the proceedings upon the records of the Court,’ the ‘ <em>legal representative’ </em>of Jacob Brenneman, so far as respects the interest formerly held in this land by Michael Brenneman.</p>

Reigle <em>v. </em>Seiger, <a href="/pa/2/0340-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Pa. 340" data-case-ids="951403" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0340-01">2 <em>Penn. Rep. </em>340</a>, turned upon the want of authority in a sheriff to sell land, subject to a condition <em>ereating </em>a lien in favor of the judgment <em>debtor, </em>so as to enable the debtor to recover the money. Steeker <em>v. </em>Shimer, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Whart.%20459" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Whart. 459">5 <em>Wh. </em>459</a>, proceeded upon the ground that John Steeker, a son, who had taken the estate at the valuation, conveyed it to Jacob Shimer, expressly subject to the payment of the principal sum set apart for the widow’s dower, to the <em>other </em>children of the intestate, upon the death of the widow. And the recital of the proceedings in the Orphans’ Court, and also, of the deed already mentioned, was suf<a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>ficient to show the intention of the parties to the deed of Jacob Shimer to Edward Shimer, and to control the general expression in the last-mentioned deed. In addition, it may be remarked, that the statement of the facts of the case, at p. 454, shows that the word <em>‘ other’ </em>was also in the deed to Edward Shimer, notwithstanding the judge who delivered the opinion seemed to treat the case as if it had been omitted. It was clear, beyond dispute, that John Stecker, who had brought the action in that case, had no equitable right to recover, against the express provisions of his own deed to Jacob Shimer, under whom the defendant claimed. The case of Duey <em>v. </em>Clemens, 1 <em>Barr </em>118, was merely a decision that a bond of indemnity against all claims, <em>i except the widow’s third,’ </em>must not be construed to <em>create a lien in favor of the obligor, </em>where none existed before, against the express terms of his own deed; but must be confined to its proper office, which was that of indemnifying against all claims, <em>excepting the existing lien for the widow’s </em>third, <em>whatever that might be.</em>
