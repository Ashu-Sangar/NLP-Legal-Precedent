      <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>This was an action of debt, brought by Maria McElhare, who sued as well for herself as for the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania <em>v. </em>Agnew, for $2375, the penalty under the Act of 1723, against usury. The defendant in the action, in 1837, lent to John Poe $950, and took his note for $1000 with interest. On the 4th September, 1838, he lent him $1425 more, and took from him a bond and mortgage for $2500, being $125 more than the two amounts actually lent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b485-6" data-blocks='[["BL_485.4",485,[141,785,1164,432]]]'>The interest on the $2500 was paid by John Poe so long as he held the mortgaged property, but afterwards, viz. in 1843 or 1844, Maria McElhare acquired the title to the property, and agreed to pay the mortgage; and from that time she paid the interest. It was testified that Poe had said that Agnew had not charged him usurious interest. Afterwards he said he had, viz. $50. This was about the time Poe made an assignment for the benefit of his creditors. After Mrs. McElhare became the purchaser of Poe’s property, Agnew agreed that he would not press for the principal, if she would pay the interest punctually.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b485-7" data-blocks='[["BL_485.5",485,[139,1216,1165,334]]]'>The mortgage fell due on the 4th September, 1843, but was not paid until 3d April, 1848, when the whole principal and the arrears of interest were paid into the Bank of Chambersburg to the credit of Agnew, and were shortly afterwards drawn out by him. The paper-book furnished to the reporter, does not contain any abstract of the declaration; but it is understood to be in the usual form, founded upon this last payment, and alleging the forbearance to have been <em>to John Poe.</em>

The <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>defendant below therefore objected, that the evidence did not sustain the declaration, which averred a forbearance to John Poe.</p>
    <p id="b487-6" data-blocks='[["BL_487.4",487,[149,514,1165,258]]]'>It would hardly be consistent with candor to encourage a refinement of this sort as a means of evading the penalty of an Act of Assembly.

    <p id="b487-7" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[149,772,1167,473]]]'>The offence is complete when more than legal interest is received “for the loan or use of money,” or “for the forbearance” of it, on “any bond or contract,” and the declaration states the case truly in form and substance, when it avers a forbearance to the obligor in the bond, for he alone could be sued upon it. It would not state it truly if it averred forbearance to Maria McElhare, though her land is liable for the debt. Besides this, the averment , of forbearance is only one form of averring that Poe had the loan and use of the money, which could not be averred of Maria McElhare, for she borrowed nothing from the defendant, and was indebted to him only indirectly.</p>
