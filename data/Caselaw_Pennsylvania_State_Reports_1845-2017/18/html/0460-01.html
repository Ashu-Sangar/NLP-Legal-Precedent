It was also alleged that at the time the notice to collect was given, John Cornman owned real estate, which was encumbered by liens to the amount of $960.38, exclusive of interests and costs ; that he owed debts,. <a id="p461" href="#p461" data-label="461" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*461</a>not reduced to judgment, to the amount of $2859.75, exclusive of interests and costs; that judgment was entered by confession on nearly all this amount on the 27th April, 1850.

Whilst he held it he was called on to know whether he was the agent of his father, and he received the notice to collect the note without denying the propriety of its being given to him, and declared that he was the agent; some days afterwards, he sold the note.</p>

Whether Samuel Wetzel was such an agent of his father, or that notice to him was notice to John Wetzel, he referred as a matter of fact to the jury. 3. He observed that if the testimony was believed, he thought the notice to Samuel Wetzel to sue the principal and recover the debt was clear and unequivocal, the consequences of neglecting to do so fairly stated, and all that the law required, in the event of neglect, to relieve the surety, in case he were absolved by the other circumstances in the case.</p>

It is argued by the plaintiff that if suit had been brought on’ the 19th January, 1850, the day the requisition was made upon him, that by the rules of Court, without any extraordinary exertion, he would not have recovered judgment by default until the August term. Whereas he did actually obtain an award of arbitrators in the suit when brought, on the 1st June, 1850. As a question of law we think this is not a sufficient answer to the defendants’ equity. If suit had been brought in a reasonable time after the surety required that it should be, the law, we think, would not require of the plaintiff to resort to the extraordinary proceeding which the Act of Assembly affords to a plaintiff to refer his cause to arbitrators, and thereby acquire a lien on the estate of the principal, unless he was requested so to do by the <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>surety in the face of impending danger. When a surety requires of a creditor to proceed to the collection of the debt or he will no longer be liable, he is bound by every consideration of regard for his rights to bring suit within a reasonable time, and place himself in a situation to proceed to the security and collection of his debt. Now the facts of this case show that if suit had been brought about the 19th January, when the plaintiff was required to sue, he might have obtained a judgment by award of arbitrators, in February, or at all events in March, and if he had procured an award any time before the 27th April, it would have been a lien upon the defendant’s (Cornman’s) real estate, and paid out of the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale. It is not a sufficient answer to the defendants’ equitable defence that Cornman owed debts,, not in judgment, on the 19th January, when the notice was given to an amount greater than his property sold for at sheriff’s sale, or than he was actually worth, if you believe he had unencumbered real estate to an amount much greater than the judgments against him, <em>at a time </em>when the plaintiff might have obtained a judgment which would have been a lien on his property and good security for his money. It was on the 19th January, 1850, that the surety gave the plaintiff the most unequivocal notice to proceed and collect his debt, or that he would no longer be liable. Why he did not sue we cannot tell, but he did not until the following May, when the estate of Cornman was covered with liens far beyond its value, and when he got his judgment it was utterly fruitless. Now he calls on the surety to pay.”</p>
