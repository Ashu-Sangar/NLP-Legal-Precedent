The question presented is, whether in the distribution of the estate under the will there must be perfect equality between the legatees; or whether the daughters and the sons, according to their respective ages, are entitled to the entire advantages which priority in time of payment affords them; or, on the contrary, whether those paid <em>last </em>shall be equalized by the allowance of interest with those who shall be paid <em>first. </em>If the Court should be of opinion that the legatees under the will are not to be equalized <em>by interest, </em>then judgment to be entered for the plaintiff for one hundred dollars, otherwise judgment to be entered for the defendant.

      <em>Opinion of the Court. </em>— “ George Belshoover, by his last will and testament, directed his executors to sell his real estate, not specifically devised, and adds: 11 give and bequeath the whole residue of my estate when sold, to be equally divided between my five sons and four daughters (naming them), share and share alike.’ He further directs, ‘ and in making the said distribution, it is my will, that as the payments come to the hands of my executors, the shares of my daughters shall be first paid, and then those of my sons respectively, according to their several ages.’</p>

He directs equality in amount, but difference in time of payment. All are to receive ‘ share and share alike,’ but the daughters are to receive their shares first. All are to receive equal shares, but at different times.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b476-6" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[333,694,1165,897]]]'>“ But it is argued that those first paid receive a benefit from the use and enjoyment of their legacies for three years prior to those who will be last paid, which destroys the equality to be effected by equal distribution. Be it so. We cannot say the testator did not intend this benefit. It would be making a will for him, not giving a construction to the one he has made, to say, that because the mode and time of payment he has directed is not alike beneficial to all his legatees, the difference in time of payment shall be compensated by inequality of distribution. Eor example, say each share would be $2000, if the whole fund was reduced to its present worth in 1848. To pay a daughter $2000 in 1848, and a son $2360 in 1851, would surely not be distributing the estate share and share alike, and paying the daughters out of the first moneys that would come to the hands of the executors. The testator evidently contemplated that his real estate would be sold on time, and not for cash. The property which he directed his executors to sell was valuable; and it is usual to sell such estates in payments. This mode of making sale, it is fair to infer, was in his mind when he directed ‘ that as the payments come to the hands of my executors, the shares of my daughters shall be first paid, and then those of my sons.’</p>

Had these executors sold for cash or for instalments bearing interest (as they might have done), the present question could not have arisen; for then, in the language of the will, the same would have been equally divided “share and share alike.” On the contrary, if in the exercise of their discretion they had sold the real estate for $9000, payable in nine annual payments of $1000 each (according to the judgment of the Court below), the eldest daughter would receive her $1000 nine years before her youngest brother, whose legacy at the same time would be worth but $649. Can such a construction of this will be sustained ? The testator directs his estate to be <em>equally </em>divided among his children, and yet the executors by such a construction have the arbitrary power of discriminating to the amount of $350 and more in favor of one child and against another. * * * Stress is laid by the Court below on the fact that the sons had received advancements from their father to the amount of $1400 each, as a reason for the interpretation given to the will. Whether the daughters were advanced or not does not appear in the case, nor is there anything in it to show with certainty that they were not; but whether they were or were not is <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>unimportant, unless the express declaration of the testator in the will is disregarded; for after directing that his estate is to be divided among his children share and share alike, the will continues, “ and in making this distribution no account is to be taken of any advancements made by me to either of them heretofore, as in that respect I consider all as settled.”</p>
