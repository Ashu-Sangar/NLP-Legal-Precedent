The plaintiffs were the heirs at law of Leonard Morey, deceased, and claimed the land as such. Both parties, plaintiffs and defendants, claimed under the same title, viz., a deed in 1822, from the treasurer of Clearfield county, in which the land was then situated, to <em>Iehabod Powers. </em>The plaintiffs claimed that under the circumstances disclosed in the evidence, Iehabod Powers was but the trustee of the legal title, for their ancestor, Leonard Morey, as to the land in dispute, viz., the north half of the Ketland lot No. 5482. In 1822, the whole of the tract was advertised for sale by the treasurer of Clearfield county for taxes, and the plaintiff’s father, Leonard Morey, being unable to attend the sales himself, agreed with Iehabod Powers, that the latter should bid off the lot for their mutual benefit, under an arrangement that each should contribute half of the purchase-money and expenses, and own half the land. Powers did as requested. The custom then was, to give notes, payable at a future time, with security, for lands purchased at treasurer’s sale. Morey asked John S. Brockway, who was going to the sales, to sign the note with Powers, and he did so at the request of Powers. The note was found in possession of Morey, and produced on trial by the plaintiffs. Brockway signed the note at the request of both Morey and Powers. The note was under seal. Powers admitted that Morey had furnished his half, and even more, of the funds to pay the note, and afterwards, during the life<a id="p124" href="#p124" data-label="124" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*124</a>time of Powers, and by his knowledge and consent, Morey paid half the taxes. The assessments given in evidence showed the one half of this lot to have been <em>assessed to Morey </em>and the other half to Powers for the years 1826, 1827, 1828, 1829,1830, and 1881. Subsequent to this, Morey and his heirs always paid the taxes on the <em>north </em>half of the lot, on the unseated list.</p>

He died in the fall of 1827, <em>in the actual possession of the south half of the </em>lot, in the observance of the original agreement, as declared by himself a few days before his death. Powers left no children, but had several brothers and sisters residing in the northern part of the state. In 1831, Joseph Chandler was in the neighbourhood, acting as the administrator of Ichabod Powers. Aug. 25, 1834, he procured a deed from the heirs of Powers for this tract of land, for $840. He permitted the land to be sold for taxes in 1836, and had it bid in for himself by Andrews, “to extinguish Morey’s claim,” as declared by himself. From this sale, Morey redeemed his half of the land. It was admitted, that Chandler conveyed the whole tract to Andrews in 1841. Andrews conveyed to A. S. Lippencott on the 31st of August, 1841. On the day preceding, viz., the 30th of August, A. D. 1841, Andrews had brought an action of ejectment against Reuben Lewis and Leonard Morey, in the Common Pleas of Clear-field county, -for the entire tract.

It is contended that Chandler and those claiming under him are purchasers of the legal title for a full and valuable consideration without notice of the trust in Morey. Notice may be either actual, legal, or constructive. As this trust rested in parol, it was not susceptible of being recorded, and, of course, there was not legal notice. Constructive notice may be where the holder of the equity <em>is in the actual </em>possession, and the law imposes the duty on a purchaser, to inquire by what authority he is there. The only evidence of possession prior to the purchase by Chandler was the small improvement by Erasmus Morey, partly on the Potter tract and a small portion on this tract, some time prior to the time Powers took possession. This improvement, according to the testimony of E. C. Winslow, had been abandoned before 1827, was grown up with bushes, the fences down, and nothing of a building left but the remains of an old pig-pen. And so it remained till the time of the purchase by Chandler in 1834. This would not be sufficient to put a purchaser on inquiry and affect him with constructive notice. There was nothing in his position as administrator to affect him with notice, and there was no evidence of his having actual notice <em>prior </em>to his purchase from the heirs. He, Chandler, is to be viewed as a purchaser without notice. That Andrews had notice, is probable, and there is evidence to prove the fact. But <em>Lippencott, </em>who bought from him for $1000 on the 31st Aug. 1841, seems to have had no knowledge of the Morey claim until informed of it by Winslow at Harrisburg. This, as actual notice, would be insufficient, as coming too late, and by a person whose information he was not bound to <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>regard. Lewis, it is true, was in possession about the time Lippencott purchased, but whether before or after, or under whom, is left so uncertain that it would not amount to constructive notice.</p>

As that part of the English statute of frauds which prohibits the parol declaration of a trust was not transferred to our Act on the same subject, an express trust in lands may, with us, be orally declared. But after some vacillation of decision, or rather 'of <em>dicta, </em>which for a time unsettled the professional mind, it is agreed that a simple avowal of acquisition for the use of another, whether made contemporaneous with, or subsequent to the fact, will not of itself support an allegation of trust: Robertson <em>v. </em>Robertson, <a href="/watts/9/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Watts 32" data-case-ids="1849959" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0032-01">9 <em>Watts </em>32</a>. Yet it is equally well settled, that if one be induced to confide in the promise of another that he will hold in trust, or that he will so purchase for one, or both, and is thus led to do what otherwise he would have forborne, or to forbear W'hat he contemplated to do, in the acquisition of an estate, whereby the promissor becomes the holder of the legal title; an attempted denial of the confidence is such a fraud as will operate to convert the purchaser into a trustee, <em>ex maleficio. </em>One of our earliest decisions under this head, is Thompson’s lessee <em>v. </em>White, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Dal.%20424" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Dal. 424">1 <em>Dal. </em>424</a>, where, to induce a wife to execute to him a conveyance of her estate, the husband promised, by will or otherwise, to settle an estate for the benefit of the wife’s relatives, in the manner previously agreed on. He died without performing his promise, and this neglect was ruled to involve such a fraud as raised a trust in favor of the disappointed relations. Stewart <em>v. </em>Brown, 2 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>461, and Brown <em>v. </em>Dysinger, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20R.%20408" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 R. 408">1 <em>R. </em>408</a>, were decided upon the same principle. In both, the complainants had trusted to the promise of another to purchase at public sale, certain land, for the benefit of the promissee; and it was held, that a subsequent denial of the undertaking converted the promissor into a trustee for him who had been deceived. The ground was that <em>mala fides </em>in the prosecution of the undertaking, inflicting a disappointment which otherwise might have been avoided by the confiding party, raised a trust commensurate with the undertaking. It is true, that, in the first of these cases, the plaintiff and defendant had been tenants in common of the land, which gave the former the benefit ' of another principle; but the Court also put the determination on the ground of faithlessness, as creative of a trust, necessary to defeat fraud. In delivering the judgment in the later determination, Mr. Justice Smith observed,-“No doubt Samuel Brown was induced by David Walker to rely on him, and therefore did not <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>'take any ocher steps to secure the land, and David Walker should not reap the benefit of such conduct; nor can he, for a trust thereby arises to Samuel Brown, for whom he becomes a trustee. To decide otherwise, and to allow him to hold the land, under such circumstances, would be supporting a breach of trust, and a fraud in law.”</p>
    <p id="b129-6" data-blocks='[["BL_129.4",129,[169,642,1180,344]]]'>The still more modern case of Kisler <em>v. </em>Kisler, <a href="/watts/2/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Watts 323" data-case-ids="1840089" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0323-01">2 <em>Watts </em>323</a>, though in its general aspect restrictive of parol trusts, is in affirm«anee of this doctrine. It concedes, that had the ward, plaintiff, trusted to his late guardian’s promise to purchase the land for him, there would have been a trust <em>ex maleficio, </em>from the conduct of the guardian in keeping the ward back as a bidder; and observes, that such a trust was enforced in Brown <em>v. </em>Dysinger, arising from the artifice of the party to be affected.</p>
    <p id="b129-7" data-blocks='[["BL_129.5",129,[184,984,1176,774]]]'>In applying these ascertained principles, it is impossible not to be convinced, that, upon the suggestion of the elder Morey, who was unable to attend the proposed sale, Powers undertook to purchase the tract in dispute for himself and Morey, the latter, who ■ was the richer of the two, agreeing to procure the requisite security, and eventually to supply the necessary funds. That Morey trusted to Powers’s promise is plain; and I think it is not to be doubted, that, but for that promise, he would have taken other steps to carry out his determination to purchase. It is equally plain, that Powers discharged his undertaking in good faith, and that, ever afterwards up to the death of the latter, each regarded the other as owner of one moiety of the tract. That they were so esteemed in the neighborhood, is put beyond question by the oral evidence and the assessment for taxes for a long series of years. Under such circumstances, to permit the heirs or alienees of Powers, with notice, to repudiate the arrangement, would be such a fraud as equity interposes to prevent, by raising a trust predicated upon the dishonest attempt.</p>

It is in proof, by his confession, that the greater part of the purchase-money was furnished by Morey. Had this been handed to Powers, and actually employed by him at the time he made the purchase, beyond question there would have resulted a trust in favor of his fellow, to the extent of the fund supplied by him, for it is clear such a trust may be <em>fro tanto: </em>Duffield <em>v. </em>Wallace, 2 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>521; Kisler <em>v. </em>Kisler. But what difference can it make that eventual payment was secured by a promissory note, made, in part at least, on Morey’s credit and at his request ? None whatever. It cannot be doubted that he was bound to the surety he procured to discharge it when due, and it is proved he did so. He is, therefore, to be regarded as though he had been actually a party to the note, and the subsequent payment of, at least, a moiety of it is reflected back to the inception of the purchase.</p>

      <a id="p130" href="#p130" data-label="130" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*130</a>Yet the plaintiffs must fail in this action. What has been said upon the point just dismissed, was elicited by the wish of the parties to have an expression of our opinion, and in reference to any future suit which may be instituted. Another question necessarily made below is, whether all of the successive alienees of the legal title had notice of the trust ? for lacking this to any one of them, defeats the trust as to each who succeeded to the title. On this subject, we agree with the Court below, and adopt the answer re -' turned by it, as to Chandler. Possibly Lippencott might be affected by notice <em>lis pendens, </em>but I have failed to perceive the slightest evidence of notice to Chandler, for it cannot be pretended he would derive the necessary knowledge through his office of administrator. He seems to have been aware of Morey’s claim in 1836, but this was after he became owner of the title. The mere assessment and payment of taxes has never been held evidence of legal or equitable title, and therefore could not convey notice of its existence. It is highly probable Chandler knew the fact, but the record presents no legal evidence of it.</p>
