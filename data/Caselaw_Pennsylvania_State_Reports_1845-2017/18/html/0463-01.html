The viewers appointed reported to April Term, 1850, in favor of a road, and their report was approved <em>nisi </em>on 9th April, 1850. At August Term, 1850, reviewers were appointed, who reported in favor of a road different from that suggested by the viewers. This report <a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>was approved <em>nisi; </em>the new road to be opened 28 feet wide. At next Term, viz., January, 1851, a petition for a re-review was presented, and re-reviewers were appointed, who reported in favor of a road changing in part the location of the road reported by <em>the </em>vieivers, and differing materially from that designated by the reviewers. This report, on the 18th April, 1851, was confirmed nisi, and the road ordered to be opened 25 feet wide. Before the second Court after the report by the re-reviewers, viz., on 18th August, 1851, exceptions to that report were filed, to the effect, that one of the re-reviewers was <em>a brother </em>of one of the petitioners for the re-review; and that another of them was <em>a relative </em>of another of the said petitioners.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b464-6" data-blocks='[["BL_464.4",464,[339,945,1160,128]]]'>The Court said that these exceptions were not filed within the time prescribed by the rules of Court, and cannot be considered by the Court; the road is therefore confirmed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b464-7" data-blocks='[["BL_464.5",464,[338,1073,1162,215]]]'>The rule of Court provides, that “exceptions to a view, review, or re-review of a road, will not be heard, unless they shall have been filed at least twenty days before the time fixed by law for their final confirmation ; and the same rule shall be applicable to the creation of new or the division of old townships.”</p>

This was overruled because it was not filed within the time prescribed by the rules of Court. An exception to a viewer on the ground of affinity to one of the petitioners, is in the nature of a challenge to a juror for cause, and cannot be taken after the party has taken his chance of a favorable report. The parties interested are presumed to have notice of the time of meeting of the viewers; and the family connections of the viewers with the petitioners, are matters which may be ascertained by diligent inquiry. It is therefore too late to make the objection after the report is made.</p>
