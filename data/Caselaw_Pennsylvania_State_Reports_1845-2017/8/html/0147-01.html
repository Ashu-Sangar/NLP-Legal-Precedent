      <em>May </em>22. This was an action of debt on articles of agreement under seal, brought by William Couch and Andrew Couch against Edward Cox, to recover a balance of the purchase-money of two tracts of land, due under said articles. It appeared by the articles of agreement, dated the 19th of February, 1842, and executed by William Couch and Andrew Couch, the plaintiffs, and Edward Cox, the defendant, that the said William and Andrew Couch bargained and sold two tracts of land situated in Barree township, Hunting-don county, to the said Edward Cox; one of them lying on and adjoining the waters of <em>Stone Greek, </em>and adjoining lands of J. Cunningham, D. Peightal, and William and Andrew Couch, and containing <em>forty-five acres and eleven perches, </em>be the same more or less; and the other tract lying on the “ <em>Warrior JRidge,” </em>adjoining lands of Joshua Green, 3). Peightal, B. Logan, and J. Cunningham, containing <em>forty-nine acres and one hundred and fifty-five perches, more or less, </em>with the buildings and improvements thereon erected, for ■ which Edward Cox agreed to pay them the sum of $1,223, in the .manner following: $623 thereof on the 1st of April, 1842; $300 on the 1st of April, 1843, with interest until paid; and the remaining $300 on the 1st of April, 1844, with interest until paid. The deed for the lands, under the articles, was to be made to Cox when he made the first payment; and the two remaining payments to be secured by the lands, and possession to be given to Cox on the 1st day of April, 1842. Cox, it appeared, went into possession of the said tracts, and between the 8th of April, 1842, and June 7th, 1843, paid $984 of the purchase-money. The balance he refused to pay, because, as he alleged, the deed tendered by William and Andrew Couch, the vendors, did not contain all the lands purchased by him, under the articles of agreement, which described the tracts by adjoiners, but not by courses and distances. But to the description of the tracts in the articles by adjoiners, the grantors had added courses and distances in the deed^tendered. The description <a id="p149" href="#p149" data-label="149" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*149</a>of the two.tracts in the said deed, which was dated the 20th day of May, 1844, was as follows:—</p>

Some time after the Couch’s had sold to Edward Cox, I got information, that they had been surveying, and that it run into mine. I went to Andrew Couch and spoke to him about this interference — do not remember his reply. He went and got the draft and showed -that to me. I found the line running up the ridge till it came into my land — called for eighty-two perches long. That was altered from eighty-two to sixty-two. I asked Andrew Couch who had made that alteration on the draft. He said his brother William had made that alteration from eighty-two to sixty-two, finding that it would run into my land. Some time after this — I am not able to say whether the Couch’s or Mr. Cox got Aquila Green to come and survey this five acres of disjjuted ground. Some person came for me to go and show where my line went. They then ran round this disputed piece, and Aquila Green made a calculation of the quantity. It was five acres and eight perches. Then Andrew Couch insisted on Aquila Green running round the balance, leaving that five acres out, for the purpose, he said, of ascertaining whether there would not be the amount of land sold to Cox yet in the survey. They started on the line between Cox and Cunningham, down the ridge. I continued with them down to the big road that leads from Couch’s to Manor Hill, and there left them. [Draft shown.] I cannot say certainly this is the draft Couch showed me. I presume it is. I do not know in whose hand-writing the alteration is. My impression is, the line laying off the five acres was not on it at that time. There are two lines on the ground, marked as laid off on this draft. I do not recollect the course of the upper line. My own is either S. or N. 88 W. The loss of five acres would affect it considerably. On this upper tract the only land fit for cultivation is on the north-east corner, next to mine. There is only a part of this five acres fit for cultivation — not all of it. I suppose not more than the half of the five acres, if that — is a hollow through it. On the east side of the hollow is pretty good, on the west side stony. The good part adjoins Cox — good land— is limestone nature mixed with sand. What runs up into my land is more of a limestone nature than the other part of it. Would, taking the five acres off, leave but a small field. I could not suppose, including what is in the five acres, or what is good of it, that there would be a field of so much as ten or twelve acres. At the east end the timber is small. The timber became better on the <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>other end — rail timber would, in my opinion, be very valuable to Mr. Cox. The yellow pine is not very valuable there — it is principally yellow pine. <em>My line runs just along the south edge of the sink-hole. The eighty-two perch line runs. pretty much into the sink-hole. The line disputedis twenty-two perches from the sink-hole.”</em>

By reason of imperfection of instruments, as well as inequalities of surface and carelessness of assistants, extreme accuracy is not to be attained by the compass and chain; while, on the other hand, calls for natural objects, or, what is much the same, known and established lines of contiguous tracts, admit of perfect certainty. When a vendor, therefore, conveys by established landmarks, the subject of the grant will neither overrun nor fall short of them. They form the true boundary, and the courses and distances serve but to point towards the place. Apply this principle to' the case below. The tract was described in the articles of agreement by calls for adjoiners, but not by courses and distances at all; and of all the land within the calls, the grantee would have become the legal owner, had he accepted the deed which was tendered in execution of the contract. But to the calls in the articles, the grantor had added courses and distances in the deed; one of which, varying from the line on the ground, would seem to carry the grant into the land of an adjoiner: and for this the vendee insisted that the vendor had not title to all the land he professed to convey. But he had title to all he sold and was to be paid for; and the consequence would have been the same, even had the course and distance fallen short of the actual boundary. The <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>vendee was, therefore, not entitled to withhold a part of the purchase-money on any such pretext. As the principle is decisive of the cause, it is unnecessary to consider the bill of exceptions to evidence.</p>
