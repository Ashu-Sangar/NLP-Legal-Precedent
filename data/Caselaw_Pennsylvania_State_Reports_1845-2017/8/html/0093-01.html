After the said compromise and payment, the sheriff sold and conveyed a certain portion of his real estate, upon which his official recognisance was a lien to one P., who went into possession. Subsequently to these transactions, the action of debt which had been compromised and paid as aforesaid, was proceeded in, and judgment recovered against the defendant, the said sheriff, who neglected to take defence and show the compromise and payment aforesaid.
