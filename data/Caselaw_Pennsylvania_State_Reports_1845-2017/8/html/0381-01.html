      <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>“ On the 5th August, 1845, a petition was presented to the Court of Quarter Sessions of this county, setting forth ‘ that public convenience seemed to require <em>that Liberty Alley, from Third Street to Front Street, in Leading, be widened into a fifty feet street, </em>and praying the court to appoint proper persons to view and lay out, <em>or widen, </em>the said alley, agreeably to the act,’ &amp;c._ Upon this petition a jury of viewers was appointed, who, on the 3d of November, 1845, reported that ‘ they had viewed and laid out the said Liberty Alley as and for a public street of the width of fifty feet; the widening, or additional thirty feet required, to be taken from the north side of said alley.’ This report was confirmed <em>nisi, </em>and within the proper time exceptions were filed.</p>

In the Church Road Case, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0200-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 200" data-case-ids="478820" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0200-01">5 W. &amp; S. 200</a>, we are told that the Quarter Sessions has no powers but what it gets from the statute, and that with regard to public roads these are to lay out, or vacate, and to alter or change an established route by laying out or vacating in whole or in part. And in that case, the prayer for a view ‘ to widen, straighten, a.nd fix the limits’ of a road which had been laid out and used for more than a century, was held to be one which the court had no warrant to grant. Under the general road-law, then, it is obvious that this court had no authority to grant this view. Nor had it any authority for that purpose under the act of 1825 and 1826, secs. 2, 3, 4, Pamph. Laws, 115, for extending the time of holding the Quarter Sessions of Berks and Bucks, and for the better regulation of the borough of Reading. By that act, sec. 2, this court may grant views for opening or extending any street, lane, or alley, in the borough of Reading, neither of which powers, as we apprehend, will cover the prayer and object of this petition.</p>
