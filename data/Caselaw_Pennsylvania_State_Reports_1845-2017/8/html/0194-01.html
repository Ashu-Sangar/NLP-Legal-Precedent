      <em>May </em>24. This was an action on the case for the breach of a parol contract, brought by Jacob Poop, administrator of Eli Eckley, the defendant in error, against Daniel Hastings, administrator of Thomas Hastings. No declaration was filed; and the cause was tried by consent, under the pleas of <em>non assumpsit </em>and <em>payment, </em>upon the allegation of the plaintiff, that Hastings, in his lifetime, agreed and promised to give to Eckley fifty acres of land, in consideration that he, Eckley, would search for and find the lines and corners of certain lands in which the said Hastings was interested; that Eckley did search for and find the lines an'd corners to the satisfaction of Hastings; but that Hastings had not given Eckley a legal title for the land, according to the terms of the said parol agreement. On the trial of the cause before Woodward, P. J., the plaintiff offered in' evidence the deposition of Christian Roop, <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>taken under a commission issued to the state of Indiana, which was objected to by the defendant: because no notice AYas served of the taking of the deposition; because the <em>second </em>and <em>third </em>interrogatories were leading; and because the deposition vras not duly certified.

Told him we were poor. He said he would give us a good time to pay for it in. We went to look at his land, and when we came to a certain place I wanted to go further. He told us he couldn’t let us go any further there, for that was some land he had given to old Mr. Eckley for showing some lines and corners. Told him if he wouldn’t let us go further, we would not have the land, for it was rough and stony. He said he could not let us have it. Some time after, when Bolinger was surveying, some person asked Hastings if he had given Eckley some land for showing lines. He said he had, and pointed to same place he had shown me. It was fifty or sixty acres. This was the best land I saw there. Eckley worked on it. Saw him grubbing.</p>

I asked him what that man was grubbing that land for. He told me he was grubbing it for himself; that this was a piece of land he had given him for his services in running lines. He told me he had given the land. Perhaps he might have said he <em>intended </em>to give it. Eckley died in 1839; I think in August.” Samuel Parker, sworn: “ Heard Hastings say that Eckley had been an important man to him in discovering lines.”</p>
