I commenced making out a statement; whilst I was doing that they were talking about the iron business, and spoke of the raising of the ore on Moore’s land. Mr. Moore intimated that he should quit digging there. General Miller said it would be breaking in on his arrangements entirely, that he had bought a depot at Allentown, and contemplated bringing ore back as he took pig iron there. This bank was on the road there — the best one. Mr. Moore said he could not be responsible for the general’s arrangements — that he must quit. The general alleged he had a right to raise ore there; Moore allowed he had no right, and must quit. Moore said he <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>would go out that day and discharge the hands. General Miller said he was unwell'or he would go out, and before he would give it up he should break all the bones in his body. By that time' I had the account made out, and I handed it to Mr. Moore. He looked over the account and objected to some prices charged for sawing, and said that it was not according to the agreement in reference to the prices. I altered the account. The ore was settled for at fifty cents a load. Moore made no objections to it. He asked if that was the price we were paying others. The ore was of a very good quality for bar iron metal.

The issue was, whether there was a specific demise for one year; and the plaintiff was bound to prove this fact, before he could recover. Demise a'technical word, and means a lease for a year, or years. To constitute a lease, it must have a certain commencement, and a certain termination, either expressly, or by reference to something expressed so as to render it certain: 2 Shep. Touch. 70, 31; Law Lib. 3, 4, 7, 9. All leases for uncertain terms, <em>arz primd facie </em>leases at will. It is the reservation of an annual rent, which turns them into leases from year to year: 2 Wm. Black. R. 1173. A mere general letting, or a letting as long as the parties please, is a lease at will: Richardson <em>v. </em>Langridge, 4 Taunt. R. 128; 4 Bac. Abr. 178, 181. In this case, it was a more license to enter and take ore, or at most a lease at will. In either aspect, Moore had a right to take and hold possession by force: Overdeer <em>v. </em>Lewis, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0090-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 90" data-case-ids="1852564" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0090-01">1 W. &amp; S. 90</a>; 4 Kent’s Com.‘113. Nothing in the supposed agreement indicating any length of time the license was to continue, and there was nothing to which it could be referred to render the period certain. An annual rent indicates the term of one year. A lease for the purpose of farming, or for any other purpose where there is an annual return made, constitutes by implication a term for a year. But, in these respects, a lease <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>or agreement is to be construed according to its character. A general letting for raising liquorice or madder (to raise which .requires two years), may be implied to- be for two years : 2 Wm. Black. Rep. 1171; Chit, on Con. 322, in note. In letting lodgings, no implication of a demise from year to year, or for any specific time. A mere license to use land, is not within the statute of frauds, because it passes no interest in the land: 7 N. Hamp. R. 237 ; <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Pick.%20273" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="16 Pick. 273">16 Pick. 273</a>; Chit, on Con. 240. A sale of potatoes in the ground, growing, with the right to take them away, only gives an easement to go on the land ; it passes no interest to the land, and trespass will not lie: 11 East Rep. 362. In Anderson’s Appeal, 3 Barr, 218, the term was construed from the character and subject of the lease. The plaintiff, therefore, on the trial, did not establish the issue on his part, directly, by proof; nor did he establish any facts from which any term for one year could be implied. The court, therefore, erred in deciding otherwise. Proof must correspond with the issue. An allegation that a defendant held premises as tenant for a term of years, or from year to year, is not made out by proof that he held by the quarter: Wilkinson <em>v. </em>Hall, 3 Bing. 506.; 3 Eng. C.'L. R. 226. The license, or lease at will, was suspended, and never renewed again by Moore.

But whether it was only a tenancy at will, or constituted a lease for a year, was a question of fact to be determined from the evidence; and as the evidence was <em>in pais, </em>and the alleged lease by parol, it was a fact properly referable to the jury. If the lease had been in writing, the construction would have been for the court. But there was evidence on both sides in relation to the alleged contract; the court were therefore not bound to take it from the jury. It was their province to instruct the jury what <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>constituted a lease for a year, and what established only a tenancy at will.</p>

    <p id="b284-5" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[328,624,1169,395]]]'>In answer to the defendant’s first point, the court tell the jury that the lease or contract as sworn to by the two witnesses therein named, did not create such a tenancy or term in <em>Miller </em>as Moore could not determine at will; but they added that the jury must determine from the whole testimony in the cause, and in this there was certainly no error. The counsel allege that the answer contained no definite instruction. It was, however, precisely adapted to the question put to the court. ,x</p>
    <p id="b284-6" data-blocks='[["BL_284.6",284,[325,1027,1174,839]]]'>The court affirmed the second proposition of the defendant, which gave this large instruction to the jury — “ that <em>in the absence of proof </em>there is no implication arises in the law that the plaintiff below (Miller) Ayas to hold and enjoy the privilege of taking ore for a year — from year to year — or any other determinate period; and in the absence of proof fixing a term or definite period, the plaintiff cannot recover in this action.” The court add, “that the answer must have the same qualification as that contained in their answer to the first point of the defendant,” that is, that the jury must look for the proof to the whole eAÚdence in the cause. I am unable to perceive any error in this answer. It gives the instruction prayed for; and certainly the jury must regard the whole evidence admitted and received, because that is their sworn duty. The court cannot, by its instructions, withdraw from the jury or limit the determination of facts which are to be ascertained and influenced by other facts proved in the cause: 5 Monroe, 280; 5 Porter, 215.</p>

This was right and proper. There Avas considerable testimony on both sides, and the defendant in this point prayed the court to instruct the jury, that if they believed the testimony of Hunt and McKinney, and all other testimony in the cause, the plaintiff below could not maintain the action. The point proposed necessarily admits and implies that certain facts are to be proved, and invokes the court to decide not merely on the sufficiency of those facts, but also on all inferences and presumptions Avhich a jury might draw from them. But this is not the province of the court. The leading fact may be presumed or inferred from other facts proved; and that is the province of the jury. Thus it has been ruled, that if the evidence only <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>shows facts from which the main, fact may be inferred or presumed by the jury, the case ought to be left to the jury, with proper legal instructions: Lindsay <em>v. </em>Lindsay, 11 Vermont, 621. The main fact here was the period or limitation of the license, agreement, or lease, if any; and that might be inferred or presumed from other .facts. There was not only opposing testimony, but in some respects conflicting testimony. In all aspects, therefore, it was proper to submit the case to the jury. We see no error in the instructions which accompanied that submission. The court are not bound to withdraw a case from the jury at the request of either party, when there is anything in it legitimately referable to them. Where the evidence is clearly insufficient, it is not error, however, if the court choose so to instruct them. But by the tenor of our own decided cases, it is error to withdraw a case from the jury when there is any matter which ought to be left to them; and I am quite free to say, that if the court below had given the instruction prayed for on this point, we would have been compelled to reverse the judgment at the instance of the other party, because it would have withdrawn from the jury what he had a right to demand should be decided by them.</p>
    <p id="b285-4" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[148,1376,1174,538]]]'>The defendant’s fourth point is identical in character with the third, inasmuch as it requires the court to decide the cause, and give a binding instruction to the jury, from certain specified evidence, and all the evidence in the cause. This is a case where the evidence was of such a nature as to require its submission to a jury. It had elements in it which ought to be disposed of by them. The court would have been perfectly warranted, therefore, in merely declining to answer affirmatively. But they answer with such qualification and reference to the proof in the cause, as to do justice to both parties. In point of law there is nothing erroneous in the answer.</p>
