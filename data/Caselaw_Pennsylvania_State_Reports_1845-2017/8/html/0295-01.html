The heirs were three sons and six' daughters. The land was appraised in three parcels at $8,144; and in 1841 one parcel was taken by each son, who entered into recognisances to pay the other heirs their several proportions of the valuation. In 1842 judgment was entered by confession by the three sons on one of the recognisances to secure a share to their sister, the wife of the present plaintiff.</p>

One of the recognisors, who was the administrator of James Morrison, had in his possession upwards of $1,200 of personal property belonging to the estate. The recognisors, who were the three sons of the intestate, were in the possession of the land taken by them at the appraisement upwards of five years: received the rents, issues, and profits thereof, and moreover, were indebted on the recognisances upwards of $8,000, much more than enough to pay every debt, including the judgment against the estate. That the land taken by the sons, therefore, was sold, was not the fault of the other heirs, but it arose from their own neglect in not paying the debts. From this it follows that the recognisors. are entitled only to a remedy on the recognisance, as against the recognisors and their property, and as there was nothing belonging to them in the hands of Mclntire, who was the administrator <em>de honis non, </em>there was nothing which could <a id="p297" href="#p297" data-label="297" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*297</a>be attached. The plaintiff in error and plaintiff below is in this dilemma. If the recognisance on which suit is brought is discharged by the sheriff’s sale, as seems to have been the opinion of the court, then this suit is improperly brought; for certainly no suit will lie on a void recognisance. But if not discharged, which is the better opinion, and the debt remains, although the lien is gone, the recognisors beyond all question have already received more than their share of the estate. They are entitled to none of the money in the hands of the garnishee; and consequently, there is nothing to attach. But in this suit the plaintiff has recovered more than $50, a judgment more favourable than he had any right to expect; for in truth, he is entitled to nothing in this action. There is now in the hands of the administrator <em>de bonis non </em>and garnishee only about the sum of $900, which must be distributed among the other heirs, the three sons having already received more than their share of the estate. As then no injury has been done to the plaintiffs in error, the judgment must be affirmed.</p>
