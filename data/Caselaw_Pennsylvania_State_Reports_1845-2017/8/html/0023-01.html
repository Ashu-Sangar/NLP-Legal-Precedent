      <em>May </em>8. From the proceedings returned to this court, on <em>certiorari, </em>directed to the Court of Quarter Sessions of Lancaster county; it appeared, that at January Sessions, 1845, the following petition was presented to the said court:—</p>

      <em>“ </em>That the erection of a new township, by dividing <em>the </em>township of Warwick into two, would be beneficial to the inhabitants of the said township of Warwick. That the division-lines which the petitioners propose are as follows, viz: Beginning in the centre of the public road leading from the city of Lancaster to Elizabeth Furnace, at the division-line of Manheim and Warwick townships, near Shober’s brick house, at the crossings of two public roads, from thence along the centre of said road, to the division line of Warwick and Elizabeth townships, by the way of the town of Warwick, Bricker’s store and Lexington.</p>

      <em>“ </em>The petitioners therefore pray the Court to appoint three impartial men to inquire into the propriety of granting the prayer of the petitioners, to make a plot or draft of said township, and the division line proposed therein, all of which they shall report to the next Court of Quarter Sessions, together with their opinion of the same, and that the Court take such order thereupon as to them shall appear just and reasonable, according'to law in such cases made and provided.”</p>

The viewers, before they enter upon their duties assigned them, shall be respectively sworn or affirmed, to perform the duties of their appointment impartially and according to the best of their judgment, and shall state in their report that they were sworn or affirmed.”</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b24-7" data-blocks='[["BL_24.7",24,[373,1476,1173,535]]]'>To this report a number of exceptions were filed, which the court after argument overruled, and granted a review. The order of the court to the reviewers appointed, was similar in form and words, to that issued and directed to the viewers or commissioners., The report of the reviewers was similar in every respect to that of the commissioners; and the court, after due consideration, confirmed the said report, erected the new township as described in the same, and ordered and decreed that it be called <em>“Penn.” </em>No exception was made in the court below to any deficiency in the order of the court as issued to the commissioners, nor in that to the reviewers.</p>

Eor this reason, each of said orders was in itself a nullity.</p>

Laws, 537. Neither the order to viewers nor the one to reviewers commanded them to inquire into the propriety, &amp;c., as specified to be done by the act. This is fatal; and no after proceedings on the part of the court, or lapse of time, can cure the defect. The viewers must be sworn to do what the act requires. Under these orders, they were not. The case is precisely like that of Harrison Township, 5 Barr, 447.</p>

The court refused to quash the proceedings for a similar misprision of the clerk in the order, which might have been set right below. That, it is true, was a road case; but the present is analogous to it, and entirely within the reason of it. Had the deficiency in the order been pointed out, the court would have supplied it, and <a id="p26" href="#p26" data-label="26" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*26</a>referred the report back to the viewers for their sanction of it; and thus the objection would have been obviated without prejudice to any one.
