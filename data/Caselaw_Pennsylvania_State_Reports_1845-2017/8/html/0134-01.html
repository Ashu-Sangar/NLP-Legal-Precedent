The witnesses differed in opinion as to the damages which would be sustained by the defendant, by reason of the construction of the proposed railroad, ranging in their estimates from $50 to $100. It was proved that the plaintiffs were in possession of the ore-bank, and of the tract of land on which it was situated; that they <em>built </em>a two-storied hewn log house thereon, of the dimensions of thirty-two feet by twenty, and a stable also; that the house was begun in October, 1846, and finished in January, 1841; and that it was in actual occupation from the time of its completion. On the part of the defendant, it was proved, that- he laboured under great disadvantages for want of an additional side track from his mines to the state road; that the best route for its construction would be on the southern side, where the plaintiffs’ road intersected the state road. No evidence was given by the defendant, in relation to the proposed railroad of the plaintiffs, nor in relation to the damages which would be sustained by him from its construction and use. But he offered to prove, that the plaintiffs were not the owners of the land in which was their coal-mine. But the court were of opinion that the title to the land could not be tried on that issue; that if the plaintiffs were in possession, it was sufficient; and that the defendant might prove, if he could, that they were not in possession.

It is already shown that the reservation of six per cent, for roads, in patents, cannot, by any proper construction, meet the provisions of the act of 1832; but when those provisions are extended to subterranean roads and to canals, and when, especially, the seizure of landings to be held in <em>fee simple, </em>or at a fixed rent, is considered, it seems utterly impossible to defend <em>this </em>scheme of forcibly appropriating private property to <em>private purposes </em>upon any other ground or pretext than that of the right of eminent domain.

We find large bodies of land in the hands of men who bought for purposes of speculation, and who refuse to sell but at enormous profits; and thus the settlement of the country and developement of its resources are greatly retarded. Towns, and even cities, are environed by masses of vacant property, owned by persons who will neither sell nor build, whereby the extension of manufactures and commerce, and the countless interests to be sub-served thereby, are grievously frustrated. But these evils, if such they be, are inherent in our system of exclusive property, and until the people choose to remodel the -system, they cannot be reached by the legislature. But were it otherwise, it is questionable whether the remedy supposed to be provided in this instance would not be productive of greater mischiefs than any it is likely to redress. Lands bordering on navigable waters, and other commercial highways, were purchased in many instances at enormous prices, with a view to the advantages of their location. Lands more remote were bought without any such advantage, and at low prices. The effect of the lateral road system, as expounded in this case, will be to sink the value of purchases made, as in the instances first mentioned, and turn the latter into gainful speculations. But a worse consequence than this may be apprehended. Purchases will be made by speculators with no other view than that of forcing lateral railroads through intervening lands, and, this done, of selling out at exorbitant profits.</p>

This court not only held the act constitutional, but wise and happily adapted to bring on the public works a large amount of business, cheapen the article of coal, which is so essential to the manufactures and commerce of the country, and to every family. The argument that it takes one man’s land and gives it to another, is untrue, and a perfect fallacy. It gives only right of way, for which an equivalent is to be paid. It is predicated on the golden rule, that you do to others as you would wish others to do unto you. It is in accordance with, and carrying out the wise provisions of the founder of this state, who gave to every grant six per cent, for roads and highways, which the grantee holds in trust for the public.

It is true that the twelfth section of the act of 1832, regulating lateral railroads (Dunlop, 490), restricts its operation to the counties of Lycoming, Luzerne, Schuylkill, and Northumberland. But the act of 28th of March, 1840 (Pamph. Laws, 176 <em>; </em>Dunlop, 797, star page), in its first section, extends the provisions of <em>the </em>act of 1832 to the counties of Northampton, Lehigh, and Cambria, and also to the <em>owner or owners of lands, mills, quarries, coal or other mines, lime-kilns, or other real estate in the vicinity of any railroad, canal, or slack-water navigation, made or to be made hereafter, by any company, individuals, or by the state of Pennsylvania. </em>The Portage Railroad was made and completed by the state, before the year 1840, and the coal-mines to which the lateral road is desired to be made, are within the distance to the road which the act allows.</p>

If this be settled affirmatively, then ascertain what amount of damages will compensate the defendant for the injury which may be done to his property by the making and using the railroad. It is contended on the part of the plaintiff in error, that the act of 1832 only gives the right to make a lateral l’ailroad to owners who have a legal title, and that title should be in evidence, and this omission is fatal to the whole proceeding. The original petition to the court stated that they were the owners. They gave evidence that they were in possession of the coal-bank and land adjacent, and had built a square log-house 32 by 20, two stories high, and finished in 1846, and in actual occupation from completion. This was a good, equitable title, subject to all the incidents of a legal estate, and gave the owners a right to build a lateral railroad, under the act of 1832, to their coal-mines.</p>
