The other was to secure and enable the plaintiffs to pay certain debts for which they were jointly and separately bound for the defendant to the Lancaster Bank and Savings Institution and to other persons. Private debts of one of the plaintiffs in the confession of judgments, which then existed, were not included. .. As the amount of the liabilities expressed could not be immediately ascertained, each amicable confession was given for a specific sum; but this did no injury to any one. The levy and amount of sale but little exceeded the actual liabilities the confession of judgments were given to secure. If there was an excess, it was not claimed, but went to subsequent executions. There was evidence, that when the defendants went bail for Heiney, who had no real estate, he promised to give them the first judgment, and these judgments were only given to cover their liabilities.</p>

There is no allegation of actual fraud, but it is said to be fraud <em>per se, </em>to give a friend confession of judgment that will cut out the first judgment, and especially in issuing execution for more than the actual liability, and before the liabilities were ascertained; and that it was error in the court to leave the question of fraudulent intention to the jury, to be judged of by the facts proved in the case.
