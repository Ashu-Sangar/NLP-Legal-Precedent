It is not a sufficient answer to this to say, that there was difficulty in the pursuit; be it so, but such difficulty he was bound by the contract of guaranty to encounter ; for the law is, that he must pursue the obligor to insolvency, and his estate so far as to show that it cannot be reached. Why was the collateral security transferred to him, but to enable him to collect Ms debt ? and he might, for that purpose, at the same time pursue the obligor and the collateral security.

The assignment of the bond by A. G. Ege to Jacob Ba'rnitz, was on the 13th of June, 1838. The assignment of C. N. Ege of Ms interest in his father’s estate, was not handed over to A. G. Ege until 6th May, 1841. On the margin of the record of the assignment on the .docket was entered, that <em>J( </em>one of the bonds for $2,000, assigned <a id="p310" href="#p310" data-label="310" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*310</a>to Jacob Barnitz, 13th June, 1838.” But this was no transfer of the security. The assignment of Charles N. Ege’s interest in his father’s estate, was for securing the payment of the three bonds given by him to A. Gr. Ege, which fell due at different periods. At the date of the assignment of the bond in question, A. Gr. Ege held C. N. Ege’s assignment referred to, as security to himself for the other two bonds. The right to the security furnished by this paper, remained in A. Gr. Ege. No right to the interest of C. N. Ege in his father’s estate was vested in Barnitz by the transfer of the bond, because no such right passed by the transfer of a part only of the fund as the security. This point is fully decided in Mandeville <em>v. </em>Welsh, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wheat.%20285" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Wheat. 285">5 Wheat. 285</a>. The object of the second transfer is obvious. Barnitz held the guaranty of A. Gr. Ege. This second agreement was in the nature of a collateral security, that A. Gr. Ege would make good his guaranty. Barnitz then held three securities, viz : the bond on C. N. Ege, the direct guaranty for its payment by A. G!. Ege, and the transfer of a portion of the interest of C. N. Ege in his father’s estate, when it should become due; and this was not given him by C. N. Ege, but by A. Gr. Ege. C. N. Ege became insolvent and left the state, when the guaranty of A. Gr. Ege became absolute; and Barnitz having two securities from him, viz: his guaranty and the assignment of C. N. Ege’s interest, he had a right to resort to either, or both, until he obtained satisfaction: 2 Dali. 115. The assignment of the bond did not carry with it C. N. Ege’s interest, &amp;e.: Mohler’s Appeal, 5 Barr, 418. A person having two securities, one primary and the other collateral, not bound to pursue both. That could not have been done in this case, because, under the will of M. Ege, deceased, C. N. Ege had no present interest in the estate. It was devised to be sold, and when sold he was to have a portion of the proceeds of sale. But it is not yet sold, and whether he will ever have any interest after the sale, is uncertain, or unknown. Barnitz had neither the right nor power to proceed on the alleged transfer of C. N. Ege’s interest. A. G-. Ege still continued the owner of it, and held the evidence of it, at all events, as trustee for the holders of the three bonds respectively referred to in it. Barnitz’s interest in it did not go beyond the right to receive his <em>fro rata </em>portion, if the money had been collected: 13 S. &amp; R. 311. It had no quality of negotiability : Leas <em>v. </em>James, 10 S. &amp;■ R. 307. If a creditor for goods sold take a chose in action as collateral security, he may sue on his original account, and is not bound to resort to his collateral security. This is not the law when the second security was taken by agree<a id="p311" href="#p311" data-label="311" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*311</a>ment, in substitution or place of tbe first, but was collateral or secondary: Lyon <em>v. </em>Huntingdon Bank, 12 S. &amp; R. 61. After tbe bond fell due, on tbe 24th December, 1889, tbe guaranty of A. G. Ege to Barnitz became absolute and unconditional by Ege’s request in writing, that bis brother should not be sued. This created a new relation between tbe parties by contract, and this was never • changed. Tbe request to sue C. N. Ege after be had become insolvent and left the state, was of no avail. Request is as defective in form, as in substance: 3 Barr, 264, 404; 15 S. &amp; R. 30; <a href="/watts/8/0258-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="8 Watts 258" data-case-ids="1848449" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0258-01">8 Watts, 258</a>, 361, 363.

The writing requested Barnitz not to bring suit, adding, “As it is not my desire to have an action brought on the bond.” The use of due diligence by the guarantee, is for the benefit of the guarantor; and he may waive it, as he may waive or give up any other obligation or duty which the law implies for his advantage. And if he does so, it is more reasonable that he should bear any loss that accrues in consequence of his own act, than that it should fall upon the party who merely obeyed his directions^; On the same principle that a surety is not discharged when the obligee gives time to the principal at the request of the surety, on the bond. It is true that some two or more years afterwards, Ege notified Barnitz to proceed on the bond, but at that time the obligor had left the state. But the duty on the part of Barnitz to use due diligence had been waived, and by that waiver it was gone, and could not be required of Barnitz when its performance was impracticable so as to charge him with the loss. ;</p>

The bond was given the 22d May, 1838, and the assignment was made the 13th of June, 1838, so that it formed no part of the original contract, and there is no evidence whatever that it was known to Barnitz at the time the bond was assigned to him, or that it entered into the contract — being a mere indemnity between the brothers, and liable to be revoked or annulled at their pleasure. After the assignment of the bond to Barnitz, that assignment did not carry this security with it; and its delivery to Barnitz did not authorize him to proceed for its recovery. But the interest of the obligor in his father’s estate was uncertain both in amount and the time of payment; the executors of the elder Ege being trustees to manage the estate, with power to sell upon certain contingencies. And it was only the share of the proceeds of “the sale to which the obligor was entitled. It has no similarity to a mortgage, which is carried by an assignment of the bond, the payment of which it secures. There the assignee may proceed on the mortgage and collect his debt. The only effectual way in which Barnitz could have made this fund available, was by proceeding on the bond, obtaining judgment, and issuing an attachment in execution, if, peradventure, that means would have been available. But this he was prevented from doing at the request of Ege, the guarantor. It is admitted that the obligor in the bond was altogether insolvent in 1842, the time when the guarantor requested Barnitz to bring suit, with the exception of this fund, and the obligor had left the state before that time. The fund is still <em>in </em>futuro, so that Ege will lose nothing by the indulgence which he requested Barnitz to give the obligor.</p>
