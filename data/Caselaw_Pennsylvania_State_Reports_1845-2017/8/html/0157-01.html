    <p class="summary" id="b158-8" data-blocks='[["BL_158.11",158,[327,1371,1177,344]]]'>“The defendant has made nine points of law in this cause.

It appears that soon after Mr. Lowry was married to his present wife, Mrs. Eliza McMillan issued a writ against him, in the Court of Common Pleas of Huntingdon county, to April Term, 1846, No. 76. On Saturday before the term of the Huntingdon court to which this writ was returnable, some kind of negotiation was set on foot between the parties, and their respective friends, to settle Mrs. McMillan’s suit against Lowry, and a prosecution which Lowry threatened against Mr. Brotherline on letters written by him and connected in some way with the same matter. It was agreed that ^the suit should be discontinued, and the letters in question given up to Mr. Brotherline. Mrs. McMillan signed a paper authorizing the prothonotary to enter a discontinuance in her suit. When Lowry was shown the paper and asked to sign the order, he refused at first, unless the word ‘ for <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>ever’ was inserted in it. Mr. Brotherline inserted it on Monday, without consent of Mrs. McMillan, and Lowry then signed the order to Mr. Cresswell to give up the letters. But he went the same day to Huntingdon, and retracted his order by requesting Mr. Cresswell to hold on to the letters. Subsequently the prosecution against Mr. Brotherline was pushed to conviction in this county. It is probable that Mr. Lowry retracted his order, and refused to stand by his agreement, because he had ascertained in the mean time that Mrs. McMillan had not consented to the insertion of the word that he thought so necessary. At least this is the construction most favourable to his own character for good faith.</p>

There is no evidence that assigns to her any other motive for signing it, than Lowry’s agreement to give up the letters of Brotherline, and that agreement was not performed, for he refused to give up the letters that same day.</p>
