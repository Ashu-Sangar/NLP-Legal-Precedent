Are we bound to award it in every case as a matter of course, where it is applied for by a widow ? The 36th section of the act of 1832, relating to Orphans’ Courts, declares that the Orphans’ Court of the proper county <em>i shall have power, </em>on the application of a widow or any lineal descendant of the decedent <em>having an interest in such, real estate,’ </em>to appoint and award an inquest. I take it that the limitation of <em>‘interest’ </em>applies as well to the widow as to the lineal descendants of the decedent: for certainly she is as competent to divest her interest, by acts after the death of her husband and before partition, as the heirs are. Where the widow’s interest and her right to have partition are denied, the question must be tried at some stage of the proceedings, and I can see no reason why it should not be tried upon the application for the writ, as well as upon exceptions to the inquest after its return. The practice of awarding an inquest as a matter of course, without further inquiry on the part of the court, even under the act of 1194, which contained no limitation as is expressed in the act of 1832, was reproved by C. J. Tilghman in Rex <em>v. </em>Rex, 3 S. &amp; R. 535. If the facts alleged are of such a nature that the inquisition can throw no light upon them, nor assist the conscience of the court, it seems to me to be the better practice to try them <em>in limine, </em>and thus save the parties the costs of an inquisition which if taken would be quashed.</p>

Simpson about the year 1810 or 1811, two or three years after the death of her former husband, Smith, a judgment was recovered against Simpson, and his curtesy in her dower was seised in execution, and on the 25th day of December, 1822, sold by the sheriff to James Smith, to whom the sheriff made his deed on the 28th April, 1823. Her marriage with Simpson subsisted until the 28th day of August, 1834, when she was divorced; and it is claimed on the part of the respondent that the sheriff’s <a id="p203" href="#p203" data-label="203" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*203</a>sale divested all her rights of dower during the coverture with Simpson, and so undoubtedly is the opinion of the Supreme Court in the case in 3 Barr, already referred to. As to that period from 1810 or 1811, to 28th day of August, 1834, the admitted facts in the case raise a legal bar to her right of dower, and establish, beyond a peradventure, that she is not a widow of the decedent, ‘ having an interest in such real estate.’</p>

It does not appear that Mrs. Simpson was originally a party to the arrangement made by her son James in his sale to Franklin B. Smith, and she would not be bound by that arrangement, unless she adopted it and made it obligatory upon her by her own voluntary act. It is claimed that she did this by her signature to the paper of 8th June, 1837. In one part of- her replication she puts the legal effect of this paper in issue by denying that she ever £ entered into a legal, valid, and binding agreement, or into any agreement of any kind, to accept the annual interest of the said sum of $2,236.15, for and during her natural life, in satisfaction of her dower in the estate of her former husband, James Smith, or of any part thereof and in another part she must be understood as placing her construction upon this paper as a receipt for her dower from the 28th August, 1834, to the 1st of August, 1837.

On the trial of the dower suit, Simpson <em>v. </em>Thomas, it was in evidence, unsupported by any collateral proof; and, under the earnest complaints of Mrs. Simpson, by her counsel, that it was fraudulent when used for anything more than as a receipt for the money acknowledged in it to be paid to her, it was difficult to divest the mind of a suspicion that she may have been overreached. Indeed, the foldings of the paper showed that she may have signed it as a receipt, in utter ignorance that it contained any other words than those which properly constitute the receipt. But all difficulty on this point is now removed by the testimony of Bond Valentine, who describes the great deliberation with which that paper was settled and executed by Mrs. Simpson, with the aid of her counsel, Mr. Potter, and of her nephew, James Dunlap, Esq., <em>‘as a final settlement between the parties in lieu of her dower, and in full of all claims which she made on William A.

    <p class="summary" id="b204-4" data-blocks='[["BL_204.4",204,[336,467,1171,1394]]]'>“ There is nothing in the testimony of Mr. Blanchard, taken on the part of the petitioner, to contradict Mr. Valentine; and no issue has been asked to try the validity of this paper before a jury. That the allegations of the petitioner raise matter for an issue proper for a jury, I agree, and that we have power to send issues to the Common Pleas for the trial of disputed facts, is beyond a doubt; but no issue has been asked for in this case, and no <em>evidence </em>of disputed facts has been exhibited or even alleged. The respondent has introduced the facts sworn to by Mr. Valentine. The petitioner does, indeed, object to the competency of the proof; but exhibits no countervailing facts, nor alleges that she has any to exhibit, so that the court will not direct an issue. Taking, then, the paper to have been fairly executed by Mrs. Simpson, for all that it contained, I have no difficulty in deciding that its legal effect is more than a mere receipt for money. It sets out with an express reference to the article, bond, or mortgage, between Franklin B. Smith and William B. Smith, by which the sum of $2,236.15 had been charged on the estate, <em>‘the interest of which is to le p&gt;aid Mrs. 33. Simpson in lieu of dower.’ </em>Then the bond and mortgage of William Thomas to Dr. Harris, charging $3,000 in ‘ <em>lieu of dower,’ </em>is distinctly stated. Then the fact that the interest on these two sums had been liquidated with the estate of James Smith, the sheriff’s vendee of Simpson’s interest, .up to the 1st of April, 1834, and that the interest from that date to 28th August, 1834, was unsettled, are fully expressed. Then follows a calculation of ‘interest in lieu of dower,’ commencing on the 28th August, 1834, and resulting in the sum of $986.62, for which the receipt was given.</p>

Thomas had invested money on the faith of that arrangement, and now she ratifies and confirms it — she makes it her own — she receives his money in pursuance of it, and if Mrs. Simpson can be bound, she must submit to this self-imposed arrangement. Such is the effect of this paper, if words and figures have not lost all power. Her receipt of money from Mr. Thomas for several years in pursuance of it, was further ratification of the arrangement, and made assu<a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>ranee doubly sure. Has Mrs. Simpson any longer an interest in tbe real estate of her husband, except as secured by the bonds and mortgage of Thomas ? Clearly not. She has accepted them in (lieu of her dower’ — these are her express words. Her dower is given up by her own deliberate act for a chosen and probably a reasonable equivalent, and she is. not entitled to have partition of the estate. Why award her a writ of partition when she is shown to have surrendered its fruits for an equivalent which she holds ? What could she acquire by it? Until she should impeach and overthrow the agreement of June, 1887, she could never have her dower assigned her, and the writ she prays for would accomplish no other purpose than to harass Thomas and load his estate with unnecessary costs.</p>

And they cover the whole ground. As to the two years or more which elapsed from the death of her first husband to her marriage with the second, I have no reluctance to bar her by force of the paper of June 8, 1837, in view of the fact that she retained the possession and enjoyed the profits of the estate. She has no equity to call upon an alienee of the heirs at law for her dower, during a period when she had the whole estate in her possession, without account. And as to the unsettled interest from the 1st of April, 1834, to 28th August, 1834, it is manifest, since the Supreme Court has given effect to the sheriff’s sale, that Mrs. Simpson has no right whatever to this interest, but that it belongs to the estate of her deceased son, James Smith. So that the two objections taken on the part of the respondent are well sustained, and the showing of the parties establishes the conclusion that Mrs. Simpson has not such an interest in the real estate of the decedent, as to entitle her, under the act of 1832, to an inquest of partition.</p>
