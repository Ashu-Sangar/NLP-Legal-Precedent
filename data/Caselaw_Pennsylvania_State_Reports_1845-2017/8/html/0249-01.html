      <em>June </em>1. This case originated in an indictment in the Quarter Sessions, for cutting timber on the land which became the subject of controversy. When the indictment came on for trial, the prosecutors and defendants agreed to convert it into an amicable action of ejectment, in which the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank were made plaintiffs, and John Harper and Sarah Miller, defendants. At the trial of the cause, a verdict and judgment were rendered for the plaintiffs. The defendants, thereupon, sued out this writ of error, on the oath of John Harper, one of the defendants, who entered into the recognisance with Michael Holcomb and Daniel Eckles, as sureties. The judgment of the court below was affirmed, and the record returned to the Common Pleas. A suit was brought upon the recognisance of bail, when Holcomb and Eckles gave their judgment bond for the amount, whereupon the plaintiff made the following assignment to them:—</p>

The cause was down for trial, I think, several times, and as I had some misgivings about a recovery, in consequence of some irregularity in the taxation of the costs, and as Daniel Eekles complained of the hardship of having to pay these costs, without having had any interest in the suit with either John Harper or Sarah Miller, I proposed, before the trial came on, that if he, Daniel Eekles and Michael Holcomb, would give their judgment bond for the amount of the costs in the case of the Bank <em>v. </em>Harper and Miller, I would assign the judgment to them, and they could recover the same from John Harper or Sarah Miller, or both. I explained to Mr. Eekles the importance of this mode of proceeding to him, and how foolish he would be to suffer a verdict and judgment to be entered in the suit then pending against himself, Holcomb, and Harper, inasmuch as nothing could be got from Harper, and he would have to bring a new action against Mrs. Miller, if he could even reach her at all by an action. I told him if he and Holcomb would give the bond, I would assign the judgment to them, and they could proceed against Harper or Miller in the name of the bank for their use, but that the assignment would be at their own risk, and without any recourse to the bank or myself.

I was concerned for George Ege. When the case in the Sessions came on for trial, after the commonwealth had given their evidence in chief, I opened the defence. I stated in the opening that the timber had been cut by George Ege, Esq., and his hands, and that it had been so done under colour of title; that Mrs. Miller had a title to the land on which the cutting had been done; and that Mr. Ege had acted as agent; and that John Harper also had a tax-title to the land; and that the timber cut by Captain Ege had been done so with the consent and approbation of Mr. Harper. My recollection is, that, after the opening was made, and before any evidence was given in for defendants, that it was suggested by the court that the case should be converted into an ejectment, and the costs already accrued should abide the result. Mr. Reed and deponent consulted with John <a id="p257" href="#p257" data-label="257" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*257</a>Harper in relation to the matter, and Mr. Harper agreed that it should be so done, and he made a party. I have stated that Judge Reed and I consulted with Harper — I may be mistaken in this — ■ possibly it was Mr. Graullagher. Captain Ege was satisfied with the arrangement as made. In the suit of the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank against John Myers and George Ege, title in Mrs. Miller was set up by defendants, and Captain Ege represented that he was acting as the agent or attorney in fact for Mrs. Miller. On the trial of the case last mentioned, Captain Ege produced two deeds of an old date, from himself to Mrs. Miller (which had never been recorded), and a general power of attorney from her to him. One of these deeds related to the Wolf tract, the other to the land on which the alleged cutting had taken place, for which Mr. Ege was indicted. In relation to Mrs. Miller’s name appearing in the ejectment along with John Harper’s, my recollection is indistinct, but my impression is, that it was placed there at the suggestion of the counsel of the bank, who wished to include both the persons under whom Captain Ege alleged he cut timber, in the case in Quarter Sessions, in this ejectment, so as to settle the title. In the ejectment case, my agreement for a fee was alone with John Harper.”</p>

It is now said that this judgment was not the subject of assignment, because it was a judgment in an action of tort: now, although it may be that a cause of‘action sounding in tort, may not be assignable, but certainly, when a judgment is recovered in such cause of action, it is assignable, or, upon the death of the plaintiff, passes to his personal representative: the only question then is, was the money paid by the surety, and did he, in consideration thereof, take an assignment ? And the proof in the case shows clearly that he did. The witness, Mr. Showers, states distinctly, that Harper and Eckles were both present when the money was paid to him, and he does <a id="p258" href="#p258" data-label="258" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*258</a>not know which paid it — Mr. Eckles did pay it, and did take the receipt for it to himself.

They were liable on their recognisance for the costs. An action on the recognisance was pending and ready for trial; when they gave their judgment-bond, and took an assignment. This assignment was without consideration, as regards Mrs. Miller; and they were not purchasers for a valuable consideration. The judgment was payment or satisfaction of the recognisance. It created no new or additional liability against Eckles and Holcomb; and it did not therefore create a new consideration for the assignment. The bond and assignment did not place Eckles and Holcomb either in a worse or better situation than they were under the recognisance. When Harper paid the money, or they for him, the judgment against Mrs. Miller was satisfied. Harper paid the bond; or, at all events, furnished the money to pay it. The <em>fieri facias </em>and attachment were, therefore, rightly set aside. If, however, Harper did not pay, and Eckles and Holcomb did pay, they are in no better situation than their principal, who on payment and taking an assignment, could not recover against Mrs. Miller, on the principle settled in Peck <em>v. </em>Ellis, 2 Johns.

The weight of the evidence certainly is, that they were paid by Eckles, one of the sureties in the recognisance. Divesting the case of this assumed fact, this is the ordinary case of a judgment against two persons, fixing them for the costs on execution against both, and a levy on the property of one, the other being insolvent. Whether Mrs. Miller, the complainant, was properly one of the defendants in the ejectment, we cannot now inquire. She appears on the record as such, and it is too late, when the execution for costs is issued, to allege she had no interest in the controversy. Her remedy, if any, is against those who without authority made her a party to the original action. It is very certain the sureties had nothing to do with the controversy in its commencement, and <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>ought not to be affected by the improper conduct (if it existed, which I doubt,) of those who undertook to act for her. It is said, she was no party to the writ of error — but this is an error; for the writ was sued out in the name of both, by the attorney of both: and Eckles and IJolcomb were the sureties of both. By entering into the recognisance, they became jointly and severally bound for payment of costs; and of course .Mrs. Miller as well as Harper may be compelled, by execution, to refund the amount paid.</p>
    <p id="AQl" data-blocks='[["BL_259.4",259,[163,778,1177,1598]]]'>But exception is taken to the execution on another ground. It is said, that the costs paid to the plaintiff by a joint trespasser, or even by his surety in a bond on a writ of error conditioned for their payment, is a satisfaction; and a sale of a judgment for them to such hail, furnishes no additional means for him to make them f&lt;|rm a co-defendant with his principal in the recognisance; and more especially so, when that principal is shown by the record to have been the real defendant in the action in which they are received. The court are of the opinion, that even if the recognisance was paid by Eckles, he had no right to be substituted in the room of the plaintiff in the ejectment, or to have the judgment marked for his use, so as to select which of the defendants he pleases to make the costs from. We do not perceive the force of the remark, that Mrs. Miller was not the principal in the ejectment ; for admitting she was not, nevertheless, she is answerable to the plaintiff as a co-defendant for the costs which follow the judgment. Nor do we think it of any moment whatever, that the original action was trespass in ejectment; for where judgment is rendered, whether the action be tort or contract matters not. In either case it is assignable, either to a third person or to a surety in the writ of error. It is not a case of substitution, but a transfer of the judgment for a valuable consideration, wMch there is nothing to prevent. We therefore see nothing exceptionable in taking an assignment of the judgment by the bail, and proceeding to coerce payment by execution, as in ordinary cases. They were compelled to pay, and had a perfect right to take a transfer of the judgment, as an indemnity. This view of the case would hardly admit of doubt, were we not unconsciously swayed by the supposition of what there is no adequate proof, that the execution was the result of a contrivance between Harper and Eckles to throw the costs on Mrs. Miller. If that had been proved, we agree the action of the court in setting aside the execution would be proper.</p>
