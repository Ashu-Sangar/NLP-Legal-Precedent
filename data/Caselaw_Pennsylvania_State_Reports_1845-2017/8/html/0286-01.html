      <em>June </em>5. .Abraham Adams, the defendant in error, who was plaintiff below, in his statement filed, claimed to recover the sum of $96.62-J from James McGuire, administrator of Hetty Adams, for the board of, and attendance upon the said Hetty in her lifetime, and for taking care of and keeping her stock on the farm, after her death, and for the expenses of her funeral. The defendant pleaded <em>non </em>assumpsit, <em>payment, </em>and <em>set-off. </em>The plaintiff replied <em>non solvit </em>and <em>no set-off. </em>On the trial, before Hepburn, P. J., the plaintiff called witnesses who testified, to some extent, to the boarding of the defendant’s intestate and keeping her stock, which consisted only of a horse and two cows. The defendant then, <em>under Ms plea of set-off, </em>gave in evidence a promissory note, dated April 1st, 1845, given by plaintiff to defendant’s intestate, for $300. On this note credits to the amount of $223.75 were endorsed, which left, on 7th April, 1846, a balance of $92.25 due and unpaid on the note.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b287-6" data-blocks='[["BL_287.6",287,[176,830,1177,692]]]'>1. That the note of Abraham Adams to Hetty Adams, of the 1st April, 1845, to the amount of the balance due upon it, given in evidence by the defendant under his plea of set-off, can only be defeated by evidence of its payment, or a release of it, founded on a good or valuable consideration. That the conversation between Hetty Adams, in her lifetime, and Abraham Adams, the witness; or that between her and Agnes Adams, another witness, not communicated to the defendant till long after the death of Hetty Adams, and not founded upon any consideration whatever; and there being no evidence to show that she had it not fully in her power, up to the time of her death, to collect the said debt, or to dispose of the said note or debt as she pleased, by cancellation, will, or otherwise, it affords no legal reason to defeat the defendant’s set-off, and he is entitled to recover it in this action.</p>
