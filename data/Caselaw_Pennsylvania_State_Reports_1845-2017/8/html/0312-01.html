The other was just entering upon his judicial career. But questions of much less importance to the happiness of society, and the unalienable rights of man, have been, not unfrequently, reconsidered by this court. ,. An important principle of the law of evidence, which had stood the test of more than forty years, and of repeated deliberate decisions of this court, was lately reversed and totally changed in Post <em>v. </em>Avery, and subsequent cases, because it was believed to work injustice in questions of property. The legislature, as in this case, had refused to alter the law as established in Steele <em>v. </em>The Phoenix Insurance Company; and the court, in the exercise of an undoubted right, corrected it themselves. We are, therefore, bold to ask them to re-judge and correct the judgment of the Supreme Court in a question which deeply affects and grieves the consciences of inoffensive and pious men, eminent for honesty, peacefulness, and orderly conduct.</p>

We have political Sabbaths, such as the 4th of July, and 22d of February. We reverence them as days of great political events. But we do not enforce their observance by legislation. But the act in question compels all to observe Sunday as a sacred day. To oblige men to refrain from labour out of regard to its holiness, is to “ control” their religious observance, as much as if they were ordered to kneel before the altar, or the images of the Saints.. And to all those who conscientiously believe that it is not a holy day — that it is not the true Sabbath of the Lord, it is an “interference” with, and a constraint of their rights <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>of conscience. It is no answer to say that the day of rest should be uniform among all. If it were a mere civil regulation, there might be some reason in it; but then it would be made a day of recreation — of relaxation; and most probably those days would not come so frequently. The French, when they discarded its religious character, when they worshipped the Goddess of Reason, and provided only for the rest of the people, fixed the tenth day. But I suppose it requires no other argument than reading the several acts upon this subject,-to prove that our legislation looks to enforcing the <em>religious </em>observance of the day. If the legislature can direct that religious observance, then there is no limit to their power over religious subjects. If they can direct the people to stay at home quietly, they can direct them to go to church, and if they can direct them to attend church, they can indicate the church to be attended. In short, if they have any power over religious subjects, they have all power. Such power would be a perfect union of church and state, so much abhorred by the people of this republic. It would inevitably lead to religious persecutions, and finally to civil and religious tyranny.</p>

To deny transubstantiation or the supremacy of the Pope, was a capital offence under one reign; and to admit them was a capital offence under another. Men were punished as blasphemers for denying the divinity of our Saviour, because the <em>“ Christian </em>religion was a part of the common law.” Men were executed in great numbers by the civil power for denying the <em>real presence, </em>because that was a part of the Christian religion — and the Christian religion was a part of the municipal law. When the Protestants gained the ascendancy, to <em>believe </em>in the real presence was contrary to the ■ Christian religion, and therefore a violation of the law, and punished by the secular arm.

Our laws in relation to acts which are <em>mala prohibita, </em>are designed to punish men for conduct deemed at variance with public policy. Fishing in numerous streams, indecent exposure of person, horse-racing, masquerading,' &amp;c., are on this account interdicted. The Hebrew legislator, in his command as to the Sabbath, had temporal as well as spiritual matters in view, or he would not have directed rest for irrational animals.</p>

It is known to be different, in regard to the same thing, in different parts of the world, under dissimilar religious influences. If laws could be made to conform to all the religious caprices that frenzied fanaticism would suggest, there rvould not be days enough in the week to accommodate such conscientious scruples. Mohammedans would want Friday, another sect another day, &amp;c., &amp;c. * The laws against bigamy would have to be declared unconstitutional, because of the consciences of those who would desire a plurality of wives. And the laws which punish the fornicator and adulterer, and the person who commits incest, would be in the same category, on account of the conscientious scruples of the Battle-Axe Christians. One class would say that the school-law, by making them pay for the education of the children of others, was unconstitutional, while another <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>•would allege the same against the militia-law, because it exacts a small fine for the non-performance of militia duty. Such positions have already been assumed. Listen to them, and qualms of conscience will be powerful in nullifying laws. In this state, where Christianity is said to be the basis of -our laws, there will be no day of rest: 11 S. &amp; R. 406; <a href="/pa/1/0013-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Pa. 13" data-case-ids="949857" data-case-paths="/pa/1/0013-01">1 Penn.

Let it be known that the legislature cannot protect orderly persons in their rest and meditations, and soon we will see the cruel and rapacious uniting to oppress those over whom they have control. If the government cannot supervise the morals of the community, it must be impotent indeed !! But these men, whose tender consciences ask to have this act made void, settled here with the full knowledge of the law. Hence they have no just cause for complaint. The sect has, it is believed, had its rise since the settlement of the state. This court has already decided this question, and in South Carolina it was decided quite recently. Therefore, as the constitution is the same, the act of Assembly the same, and the circumstances of the country the same, that they were when former adjudications were had, no good reasons exist for a departure from them: and as this court holds that a law should not be declared unconstitutional without its provisions are manifestly so (<a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20277" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 277">2 W. &amp; S. 277</a>), it is hoped the judgment of the court below will be affirmed.

      <a id="p322" href="#p322" data-label="322" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*322</a>The question thus raised is not presented to the court for the first time. It was here made as long ago as the year 1817, in the case of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Wolf (3 S. &amp; R.; 4 S.); and, after argument, solemnly decided adversely to the position of the plaintiff in error. Until now, so far as we know, the soundness of this determination has not only passed unquestioned, but is incidentally recognised by other cases. Upon the maxim <em>stare decisis, </em>and looking only to the ordinary course of judicial administration, we might, perhaps, without impropriety, have declined to consider the question as an open one in Pennsylvania. But, impressed with the importance of preserving and protecting the unrestrained liberty of conscience guarantied by the constitution of the United States, and of the several states of the confederacy, including our own, and desirous of retrieving any error which, by possibility, might have been committed in so grave an inquiry, we have given close attention to the ingenious argument addressed to us by the counsel of the plaintiff in error, who, it is understood, represents a portion of our citizens belonging to a respectable Christian sect, which claims and keeps the seventh day of the week as the true Sabbath. The conclusion at which we have arrived, after much reflection, is in consonance with that before announced by this court in the case just alluded to.</p>

No man, living under the protection of our institutions, can be coerced to profess any form of religious belief, or to practise any peculiar mode of worship, in preference to another. In this respect, the Christian, the Jew, the Mohammedan, and the Pagan, are alike entitled to protection. Nay, the Infidel, who madly rejects all belief in a Divine Essence, may safely do so, in reference to civil punishment, so long as he refrains from the wanton and malicious proclamation of his opinions with intent to outrage the moral and religious convictions of a community, the vast majority of whom are Christians. But beyond this, conscientious doctrines and practices can claim no immunity from the operation of general laws made for the government and to promote the welfare of the whole people. In the language of Chief Justice Gibson, the right of conscience, as understood under our organic law, “is simply a right to worship the Supreme Being according to the dictates of the heart; to adopt any creed or hold any opinion whatever, or to support any religion; and to do, or forbear to do, any act for conscience’ sake, the doing or forbearing of which is not prejudicial to the public weal” (Common<a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>wealth <em>v. </em>Lesher, 17 S. &amp; R. 160; enforced in Simons <em>v. </em>Gratz, <a href="/pa/2/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="2 Pa. 416" data-case-ids="951262" data-case-paths="/pa/2/0416-01">2 Penn. Rep. 416</a>). Does the act of Assembly in question impinge upon this natural right or on the constitutional declaration which seeks to foster and protect it ? It is insisted, this question must receive an affirmative response, because, as it is said, the statute treats the first day of the week as a holy and sacred day, and prohibits labour as a profanation of the Lord’s day; and it is thus proved to be, not a mere civil regulation to give rest to man, but an attempt to exalt, by law, the religious belief of certain sects over that of others.</p>
    <p id="b323-4" data-blocks='[["BL_323.4",323,[137,879,1190,1505]]]'>Though it may have been a motive with the law-makers to prohibit the profanation of a day regarded by them as sacred — and certainly there are expressions used in the statute that justify this conclusion — it is not perceived how this fact can vitally affect the question at issue. All agree that to the well-being of society, periods of rest are absolutely necessary. To be productive of the required advantage, these periods must recur at stated intervals, so that the mass of which the community is composed, may enjoy a respite from labour at the same' time. They may be established by common consent, or, as is conceded, the legislative power of the state may, without impropriety, interfere to fix the time of their stated return and enforce obedience to the direction. When this happens, some one day must be selected, and it has been said the round of the week presents hone which, being preferred, might not be regarded as favouring some one of - the numerous religious sects into which mankind are divided. In a Christian community, where a very large majority of the people celebrate the first day of the week as their chosen period of rest from labour, it is not surprising that that day should have received the legislative sanction: and as it is also devoted to religious observances, we are prepared to esti-. mate the reason why the statute should speak of it as the Lord’s day, and denominate the infraction of its legalized rest, a profanation. Yet this does not change the character of the enactment. It is still, essentially, but a civil regulation made for the government of man as a member of society, and obedience to it may properly be enforced by penal sanctions. To say that one of the objects of the legislature was to assert the sanctity of the particular' day selected, is to say nothing in proof of the unconstitutionality of the act, imless in this the religious conscience of others has been offended and their rights invaded.</p>
    <p id="b323-5" data-blocks='[["BL_323.5",323,[147,2389,1179,97]],["BL_324.1",324,[310,374,1182,2052]]]'>But it is argued, with apparent conviction of its truth, that to. compel men to refrain from labour, <em>solely </em>from regard to the <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>imputed holiness of a particular day, is, within the meaning of the constitution, to “control” the religious observance, and to “interfere” with and constrain the consciences of those who honestly disbelieve the asserted sanctity of the selected day. We cannot assent to this. So long as no attempt is made to force upon others the adoption of the belief entertained by the governing power, or to compel a practice in accordance with it, so long is conscience left in the enjoyment of its natural right of individual decision and independent religious action. There is nothing to prevent the unrestrained expression of an adverse belief — though perhaps, with less of imposing effect than power lends to opinion, nor any hindrance offered to the full enjoyment of it, at least, so far as the exercise of religious devotion is involved. The error of the plaintiff’s position is that it confounds the reason of the prohibition with its actual effect, and thus mistakes the mere restraint of physical exertion for the fetters that clog the freedom of mind and conscience. But were this otherwise, the plaintiff’s argument is inapplicable to the act of 1194. The conclusions drawn from some of its language are as inexpressive of its practical operation, as of the principal intent of its makers. The phraseology used may indicate a conviction of the holy character of the first day of the week, but as this simple expression of an abstract opinion, which all other men are at liberty to adopt or reject, carries with it no obligation beyond the influence attendant upon the expression itself, it cannot be said a primary object of the act was, authoritatively, to assert the supremacy of Sunday as of Divine appointment. Had such been the intent, irrespective of its statutory character as a day of rest from secular employment, its framers would not have stopped short with a bare interdiction of labour and worldly amusements. Following the example offered by older states and communities, they would have commanded the performance of religious rites, or at least, some express recognition of the day as the true Sabbath. Such a requisition, we agree with the plaintiff in error, would be a palpable interference with the rights of conscience. But nothing like this is exacted. On the contrary, every one is left at full liberty to shape his own convictions, and practically to assert them to the extent of a free exercise of his religious views. In this, as in other respects, the conscience of each is left uncontrolled by legal coercion, to pursue its own inquiries and to adopt its own conclusions. In this aspect of the statute there is, therefore, nothing in derogation of the constitutional inhibition.</p>

It intermeddles not with the natural and indefeasible right of all men to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of their own consciences; it compels none to attend, erect, or support any place of worship, or to maintain any ministry against his consent; it pretends not to control or to interfere with the rights of conscience, and it establishes no preference for any religious establishment or mode of worship. It treats no religious doctrine as paramount in the state; it enforces no unwilling attendance upon the celebration of Divine worship. It says not to the Jew or Sabbatarian, You shall desecrate the day you esteem as holy, and keep sacred to religion that <em>we </em>deem to be so. It enters upon no discussion of rival claims of the first and seventh days of the week, nor pretends to bind upon the conscience of any man any conclusion upon a subject which each must decide for himself. It intrudes not into the domestic circle to dictate when, where, or to what god its inmates shall address their orisons; nor does it presume to enter the synagogue of the Israelite, or the church of the Seventh-day Christians, to command or even persuade their attendance in the temples of those who especially approach the altar on Sunday. It does not, in the slightest degree, infringe upon the Sabbath of any sect, or curtail their freedom of worship. It detracts not one hour from any period of time they may feel bound to devote to this object, nor does it add a moment beyond what they may choose to employ, Its sole mission is to inculcate a temporary weekly cessation from labour, but it adds not to this requirement any religious obligation.</p>

It leaves all free alike in the exercise of their distinctive religious tenets, saying to none, What doest thou? As I have said, the selection of the day of rest is but a question of expediency, and if from the choice falling on the first day of the week, the Jew and the Seventh-day Christian suffer the inconvenience of two successive days of withdrawal from worldly affairs, it is an incidental worldly disadvantage, temporarily injurious, it may be, to them, but conferring no superior religious position upon those who worship upon the first day of the week. The law intends no preference. The command to abstain from labour is addressed to every citizen, irrespective of his religious belief, and if an inconvenience results to some, it is a consequence of the generality of the provision. But this affords no argument against the constitutionality of the law, <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>however strong the argument might he felt when addressed to the legislature as a reason for a modification of the statute.</p>

Were this so, the law which compels him to inaction upon one of the six, might well be regarded as an invasion of his conscientious convictions. But for this supposed article of his faith, his counsel refers us to no other warrant than that command of the decalogue which teaches, “ Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy; six days shalt thou labour and do all thy work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God; in it thou shall not do any work.” But without other evidence than the mere suggestion of counsel, we cannot believe that the religious sect to which the plaintiff in error belongs, have so construed this commandment as to make it imperative on its members, literally, to labour on every day of the week other than the seventh. Such is not rationally its meaning, nor is it that assigned to the word by the ancient people to whom it was originally delivered by the Deity.</p>
    <p id="b326-5" data-blocks='[["BL_326.5",326,[327,1368,1171,644]]]'>From the beginning even until now, it is regarded by them as intended to set apart a day of religious rest, but not as commanding six days of labour. Within six days the Israelite was directed to do all his work, in order that he might devote the seventh, uninterruptedly, to the service of God, but it was never imagined that he was under an imperative obligation to fill up each day of the other six with some, worldly employment. In the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Wolf, the court rightly repudiates such a notion, and in this it has been followed by other tribunals. Indeed, the meaning of the command is so obvious as scarcely to leave room for construction; and accordingly, so far as we are informed, the practice of all who profess to believe in the Old and New Testaments, has been in consonance with the original interpretation.</p>
