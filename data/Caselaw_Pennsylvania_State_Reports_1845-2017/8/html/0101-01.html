      <em>May </em>16. This was an action of debt brought on an administration bond, to recover a legacy, in which the Commonwealth, for the use of John Walck, a legatee under the will of Dietrick Walck, deceased, and defendant in error, was plaintiff, and Philip A. Small, a surety in the administration bond, and plaintiff in error, Was defendant. The facts of the case, as if found by a special verdict, were submitted for the opinion of the court below, in a case stated, with leave to take a writ of error, and were in substance as follows:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b101-7" data-blocks='[["BL_101.7",101,[112,1269,1177,1199]]]'>Dietrick Walck, in and by his last will and testament, which was duly proved and recorded on the 7th March, 1834, gave certain legacies to John Walck, the plaintiff below, and others, and appointed one Jacob Lehman his executor. Lehman, the executor, filed his administration account in the register’s office of the county, on the 26th day of May, 1835, which was duly confirmed by the Orphans’ Court. The account exhibited a balance of $973.88, in the hands of the executor and in favour of the estate. On the 4th of August, 1835, Lehman presented a petition to the Orphans’ Court, setting forth, that he had settled <em>an account </em>of his administration of the testator’s estate, which had been confirmed by the court, and prayed to be discharged from the further execution of the said trust. The court thereupon discharged him, and on the same day, <em>on motion </em>made to that effect, appointed Henry Y. Slay-maker administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of the estate of the said Die-trick Walck, deceased, on his giving bail in double the amount of the balance in favour of the estate as exhibited by the account of Lehman, the executor. On the 24th of August, 1835, Slaymaker, with Philip A. Small, the defendant below, and another as his sureties, executed and delivered a bond as administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>in the sum directed; 'whereupon, letters of administration were granted to the said Henry Y. Slaymaker, as administrator <em>de bonis non </em>of the said Dietrick Walck, deceased. The conditions of the bond, so far as they are material here, are as follows: — ■</p>

The condition to pay according to the decree of the Orphans’ Court, pursuant to the law relating to collateral inheritance, and <em>the law </em>now in force in the commonwealth, is specific. <em>All </em>the laws of the commonwealth are not meant. The decrees of the coiu’t would be intended to be conformable to law, and the law of collateral inheritance would be embraced under the general phrase. <em>The law </em>referred to is the intestate law. The English bond names the statute of distribution in terms (Toller, 96). Our statute of 1794, relating to intestates, uses the phrase: <em>“pursuant to the true intent and meaning of this act.'” </em>The codifiers tell us that they have borrowed the present form from the act of 1794: Report on Registers’ Act, p. 34. The old act of 1705 is in similar terms to the act of 1794: 1 Dali. Law, App. 43. Instead of a condition to pay according to the will of the deceased, we have a condition not to pay at all, but to surrender the letters in case there be one. A surety cannot be held beyond the terms of his contract.</p>

The plaintiff below is not without remedy. It is better to hold the register responsible under the law for his own negligence, than to strain the contract of the surety to screen the officer. The law recognises the difference between this bond and the one which the case required, and to disregard the distinction is to disregard the law. It cannot be held that it makes no difference what sort of bond is given in any case, and <em>any </em>bond is good for <em>every </em>purpose.

This precise point is ruled in Fulcher <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth for the use of Beale, 3 J. J. Marshall, 592. In that case it iso decided, that if an administrator with the will annexed, has not entered into such bond as his character required, but executes a bond with such conditions as are required in ordinary administration bonds, he and his sureties are not liable on such bond for a legacy. The case is identical with the present; and it is difficult to understand how the decree could have been otherwise. But it is said the bond is not void, but may be enforced as a voluntary bond. And this may be true; but yet it does not vary the question, because still the objection remains, that no one condition of the bond embraces the case of a legacy, and the parties can only be liable for breach of its conditions. Indeed, the bond is executed on the supposition that there is no will; for it is part of the conditions of the bond, if any will is thereafter discovered and proved in the register’s office, the administrator being thereto required, shall deliver up the letters of administration. It is one thing for sureties to enter into an administration bond, <em>cum testamento </em>annexo, another and quite a different thing to bind themselves in a bond as in case of an intestacy.</p>
