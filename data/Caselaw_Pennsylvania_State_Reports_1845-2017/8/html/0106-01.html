On the trial, the plaintiff gave in evidence the bond in suit, which was given by Jacob Brenner, the defendant, to Christian Herr, sen., for the payment of $737, dated December 5th, 1845, and payable on the 1st day of April, 1846, with interest from its date. This bond, it appeared, had been mislaid; and it was supposed to be lost, until some time after the death of the obligee therein, the said Christian Herr, sen. Letters of administration on the estate of the said Christian Herr, son., were granted to the plaintiff, his son, on the 9th day of February, 1846.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b106-7" data-blocks='[["BL_106.7",106,[340,1536,1178,637]]]'>The defendant alleged, and supported his allegations with some proof, that a new bond was delivered by him to the plaintiff, and accepted by him, to supply the place of the bond supposed to be lost; that the parties met on the 4th of April, 1846, three days after the bond became due, and made a settlement, under which the plaintiff, upon his own proposition, agreed to accept and did accept the sum of $650, in satisfaction or payment of the new bond, which was then given up by the plaintiff to the defendant, accompanied with a promise by the plaintiff to deliver up to the defendant the old bond, if ever found. It was also in evidence, that the plaintiff admitted to two witnesses that he had settled with the defendant, but had been compelled to remit a part of the bond.</p>

A part of this was unpaid on the 4th of April, 1846; and has not been paid since. Whatever this part was, a balance remained of the bond; and the question now is, whether the circumstances, insisted on by the defendant as having occurred on the 4th of April, between Chris<a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>tian Herr and himself, constitute an available defence in this action. If one man owes another, and is called on for the money before it is due, and if in consideration of his paying before it is due, the party to whom he is indebted chooses to take less than is owing, it will be a valid satisfaction for the whole. So, if the money owing is to be paid at a distant place, and it is agreed that a less sum than is owing be paid and received where the parties then are, in satisfaction of the debt, this agreement is good and the satisfaction is sufficient. 3 Hawk, 350; <a href="/ky/12/0049-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Litt. 49" data-case-ids="4216109" data-case-paths="/ky/12/0049-01">2 Litt. 49</a>; 3 Bulst. 301; 1 Com.

The amount was not disputed, nor the debt; and a suit might have been brought upon the bond, as a lost bond, and the whole recovered, though the writing had never been found. Whatever amount of this bond remained unpaid, is therefore recoverable in this action, though Christian Herr did say on receiving the money paid by Jacob Brenner — it was all right — though he gave up the new bond, and though he said, that when he found the old bond, he would give up that also. Such an agreement and payment are no accord and satisfaction, and cannot establish a defence for Jacob Brenner, beyond the amount which he actually paid.”</p>

Brenner insists and gave some evidence that he gave a new bond to the plaintiff below to supply its place. It was in evidence that the parties met on the 4th of April, 1846, when the new bond was delivered up and $650 was accepted as payment, when Herr promised that if the old bond was ever found he would deliver it up as cancelled. The defendant in error denies this. The material question was a fact for the jury — the truth of Brenner’s allegation — for if .the new bond was delivered and accepted by Herr, and re-delivered up to Brenner on the payment of the $650, as young Brenner swears, the plaintiff ought not to recover, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Johns.%2088" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="16 Johns. 88">16 Johns. 88</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Johns.%20392" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="5 Johns. 392">5 Johns. 392</a>.
