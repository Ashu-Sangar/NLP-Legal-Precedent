      <em>June </em>1. This was an indictment under the 21st section of the act of the 12th July, 1842, entitled, “An act to abolish imprisonment for debt, and to punish fraudulent debtors,” against Johnson Moore, the defendant below, for passing a worthless $5 note of the Commercial Bank of Millington, in the state of Maryland, on Philip Harman, the prosecutor, representing the said note as a good one, and thereby obtaining a receipt in full from Harman, in discharge of a debt due and owing by the said Moore to the said Harman. The question in this case arose upon the following facts, as proved upon the trial by Philip Harman, the prosecutor:— Johnson Moore, the plaintiff in error, being indebted to Philip Harman, the prosecutor, for work and labour performed by the said Harman, some time in the summer of 1846, was called upon for payment. The parties settled the account in writing, on the 23d day of December, 1846, by which it appeared that a balance of $8.76 was due to Harman. Moore thereupon paid this balance to Harman, who gave him a receipt in full. Harman testified that Moore gave him, in- payment, a $5 Millington Bank note — the note in question — also, a $2 and a $1 relief note, and the rest in silver; that the Millington note remained in his possession from the time he received it from Moore until the trial, with the exception of a short time, one day, when his son took it to purchase some articles at a store, where he ascertained it to be worthless, and returned it immediately to his father. Some time in the following February, soon after Harman ascertained that the note was worthless, he called on Moore, with the note in question, which he alleged had been given to him by Moore in payment of the balance found to be due on their account. The Commercial Bank of Millington, in the state of Maryland, was once in good credit, but had failed several years previously to this transaction. Moore denied that he had given any such note to Harman, and refused to give him another for it. This prosecution was then instituted.</p>

The court (Hepburn, P. J.) instructed the jury that the offence was indictable under the act of 12th July, 1842. The defendant was convicted.

The receipt for the payment of money is not a valuable thing, it has no value either as a loss to the prosecutor, or an acquisition to the defendant: U. S. Crim. Law, 115; Serg. Crim. Law, 464. The indictment is also defective in this, that it does not set out whose personal property, or other valuable thing, was lost or acquired. Did this receipt belong to the prosecutor, or if it did, had it any value in his hands while it remained there, or in the hands of the defendant when delivered to him ? Certainly none: for any evidence that would be sufficient to convict him of an offence for obtaining it, made it of no value to him; it was but <em>primd facie </em>evidence of payment, subject to be defeated in its operation by proof of the allegations now made.</p>
