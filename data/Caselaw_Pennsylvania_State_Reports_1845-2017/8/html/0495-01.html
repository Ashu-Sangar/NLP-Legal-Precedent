It appeared that Fitch, who was a livery-stable keeper, owned two black carriages, and that Dannels, who was also a livery-stable keeper, owned two yellow carriages. For mutual accommodation, they made a temporary exchange: Dannels taking a black carriage, and Fitch a yellow one. To prevent, suspicion of partnership, and to enable them to keep up the prices,, it was agreed that the difference in value between the two carriages should be agreed on, but not paid. They then made estimates of their respective stock, and agreed to keep accounts, and divide profits in proportion to their stock. It was further proved, that they admitted a partnership in the profits, but that the ownership of the property should remain as before.</p>

The main point of defence set up is, that by a collusive agreement between the plaintiff and defendant, a sham trade or exchange ivas entered into between them, of a yellow and a black carriage, for the purpose of carrying on their business. The exact mode in which this exchange was to be beneficial to their business, is not very apparent to me, nor is it material. Each one was to furnish his own stock, and they were to divide the product of the business or earnings of all the stock in proportion to the amount furnished by each. It appears, also, that the joint interest in the amount of business was to be secret, and that each was to be held out to the public as doing business for himself. It is contended by the defendant that as the parties had held out to the public that Dannels was the owner of the black carriage, the-one claimed in this suit, and that the plaintiff was the owner of the yellow one, which he returned to „the <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>defendant before bringing this suit; that the plaintiff cannot now contradict that state of things; that it would be against public policy to permit it.</p>

And this will be done on the general principle that the law will not lend its aid in assisting one or more individuals to cheat others.</p>

They contracted, in relation to these coaches, as individuals. It is not pretended that there was a joint ownership. On the contrary, whether we regard the apparent or real state of things relating to the ownership of the horses and carriages, it was a distinct individual ownership.</p>

      <em>Sale </em>v. <em>Fitch. </em>The action of replevin was sufficient notice to the bail in the replevin-bond, that the plaintiff in that suit claimed to be the owner of the property. Benezer Hale knew that the property was in dispute between the parties, and he undertook as bail <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>to maintain that the claim of Dannels was the best and was good. The condition of the bond is, that “if the said Dannels, the defendant, shall appear, &amp;c., and defend and make good his claim to the said carriage, and indemnify and keep the sheriff harmless in the premises, then the bond to be void, otherwise to remain in full force and virtue.” The defendant did not make good his claim. On the contrary, judgment was rendered against him for $300 damages, with costs of suit. Why then should not the bail abide the tenor of his bond ?</p>
    <p id="b498-4" data-blocks='[["BL_498.4",498,[339,840,1168,494]]]'>The matter set forth in the special plea is not sufficient to discharge and exonerate him, because he did not suffer for what he alleges to have been a secret and fraudulent agreement between Fitch and Dannels, by virtue of which a collusive and false state of the ownership of the property existed in Dannels by consent of the plaintiff Fitch. If Hale had trusted Dannels, by reason of and in consequence of that apparent ownership, either with money, goods, or credit, the authorities cited, and the argument used by the ingenious counsel for the plaintiff in error, would have had full play and effect.</p>
    <p id="b498-5" data-blocks='[["BL_498.5",498,[338,1340,1169,336]]]'>But Hale did not enter bail until after the fog was dispersed, and with full notice of the claim of Fitch. He undertook to maintain the claim of Dannels against Fitch, as between themselves and on their own contracts. If he chose to judge of the law, and was mistaken, it was his own fault or misfortune. The law adjudged the controversy against Dannels, and the replevin-bond became absolute.</p>
