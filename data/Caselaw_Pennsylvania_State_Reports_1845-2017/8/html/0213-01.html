The court not only erred in answering the sixth and seventh points put by plaintiffs’ counsel, in the negative, but in answering the third and fourth points, put by defendants’ counsel, in the affirmative. The court, in answering these points in the affirmative, tell the jury “that the respective rights of the parties depend upon the fairness and honesty of the sale by said Stewart to his sons, John and Thomas“ and if a fair consideration is paid or <em>promised </em>to be paid, such sale is valid, and will vest a good title in the sons.”</p>

This court decided in the case of Kepner <em>v. </em>Burkhart, 5 Barr, 478, that a sale where judgment bonds were given, payable in six successive years, which were intended to be applied by the vendor to the payment of his debts, and were actually tendered by him to his creditors, was fraudulent within the statute of 13 Eliz.</p>

It is sufficient for us that we obtained the verdict of the jury, and the subsequent approbation of the court, in a motion for a new trial. The only topic involving the powers of this court, hinted at by the counsel for the plaintiffs in error, is, that all the facts of the case are such as required of the court below to instruct the jury, that they constituted a legal fraud on the part of the defendants, such as entitled the plaintiffs <em>to </em>a verdict. We might for the sake of the argument concede this, and answer to it; that no such proposition was made to the court below, none such was answered, and none such is now assigned for error. But the debt <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>of the plaintiffs, for which the defendant was but a surety, when he became such surety, he communicated the fact to the plaintiffs, that he had disposed of his property, although he had not at that time actually executed the contract of sale. This shows that the sale made to his sons, was not for the purpose of hindering or delaying his creditors. It is said, too, that the agreement of the father to pay his son for labour performed, was fraudulent, because he had not been previously bound to pay: but whatever may be said with regard to the sufficiency of a moral obligation, as a consideration for a promise, and the old authorities on that subject, the law now is — that a moral obligation predicated upon an actual benefit derived, is a sufficient consideration for a promise to pay. Our own court has settled this: Grreeves <em>v. </em>McAllister, <a href="/binn/2/0591-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Binn. 591" data-case-ids="1788959" data-case-paths="/binn/2/0591-01">2 Binn. 591</a>; Clark <em>v. </em>Herring, <a href="/binn/5/0033-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="5 Binn. 33" data-case-ids="1793634" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0033-01">5 Binn. 33</a>; Austin <em>v. </em>McClure, 4 Ball. 226; Hassinger <em>v. </em>Solms, 5 S. &amp; B&gt;. 12.</p>

But if such allowance were made with a view to creating a debt which had no existence before, and which never was intended to be claimed by the son, or paid by the father, until after the father became largely indebted, and then resorted to for the purpose of concocting a consideration to support a sale by the father to his sons, it would render the whole transaction fraudulent and void in law, and a sale of the property afterwards by the sheriff on a judgment, against the father, would vest in the purchaser the father’s title, as fully and effectively as if the agreement and deed had never been made; and whether this sale is of that character, the jury will determine from the evidence, and find accordingly.”</p>

In Walker’s Estate, <a href="/rawle/3/0243-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="3 Rawle 243" data-case-ids="1822537" data-case-paths="/rawle/3/0243-01">3 Rawle, 243</a>; this court declared that where a son continues with his father after his arrival at full age, and is supported by him (as in this case), without any contract to be paid for his services, he cannot in general, after his death, support a claim against his estate for compensation for his labour. The law on this subject was more fully considered in Candor’s Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0513-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 513" data-case-ids="478603" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0513-01">5 W. &amp; S. 513</a>, where it was solemnly settled, that a child <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>is not entitled to recover wages for services rendered from the estate of his deceased parent, unless upon clear and unequivocal proof, leaving no doubt that the relation between the parties was not the ordinary one of parent and child, but of master and servant. In this latter case, the son, being administrator of his father, claimed a credit for $1,500 for work, labour, and services rendered to his father, while a member of his family, for many years after he arrived at full age, which was allowed by the register and the Orphans’ Court. This court struck it out, although there was evidence of a sister that the old man said Robert should be paid in some way, because such a claim was payment with damage to the rights of creditors, as well as the other heirs, and this court could give it no countenance.</p>
    <p id="b217-4" data-blocks='[["BL_217.4",217,[148,1041,1175,899]]]'>What does this case present but a son living with his father a few years after he became of age; the father being largely indebted, conveying to his son, directing near a moiety of the consideration to be applied to certain debts, and reserving a trust to himself? But little of this direction has been complied with. To establish such a conveyance would lead to the most mischievous consequences. No matter what were the debts of a parent, his children who lived with him, after they were of full age, would take the estate. It is the duty of this court to avoid establishing such a temptation. If old Mr. Stewart had died before this deed was made, his son John could not by law have recovered a cent. Our law is too just in its principles to allow a man indebted to divest himself of his property in favour of his children, for thereby his creditors would be defrauded, and such a conveyance would be void as against them. It is within the letter as well as spirit of the statute of Elizabeth, which cannot be too strictly guarded by the administrators of the law. We think both points in this case ought to have been answered substantially in the affirmative.</p>
