But the courts in England and in many of our sister states, following the lead of Whitcomb, <em>v. </em>Whiting, have decided the very reverse; a consideration that weakens the force of the cases from the same courts cited in this argument, and relied upon as decisive of the very question in this case. Whit-comb <em>v. </em>Whiting, and other cases of the same class, were avowedly “considered” by the court, in Levy <em>v. </em>Cadet, which was expressly ruled “upon general principles,” and was not put upon the fact that the acknowledgment was not made till after the expiration of the six years. It has, therefore, all the effect of overruling them. It must be borne in mind, however, to reconcile the case in this aspect of it with Houser <em>v. </em>Irvine, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0345-01" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 345" data-case-ids="1854666" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0345-01">3 W. &amp; S. 345</a> (in which it is decided that a promise by one partner, after dissolution, but within <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>the six years, hinds the firm, and takes the case out of the statute), that the last case was ruled by the governing principle, in the ease of Desaque <em>v. </em>Davis; in which the general authority of a liquidating partner was held to be far more extensive than it was recognised to be by the court in Levy <em>v. </em>Cadet. In Forney <em>v. </em>Benedict, 5 Barr, 226, it is said that the acknowledgment of the debt does not stop the progress of the statute. It creates a new and independent promise. And the true consideration of the promise made within the six years, is the injury it might work to the creditor by inducing him to repose on it till it would be too late. Hence, where the promise could have no such effect, it is <em>nudum </em>pactum, as was decided in Case <em>v. </em>Cushman. Tested by this rule, there ivas no consideration passing from Eyster to Zent, when the latter relied upon the partial payment made by Heart. It is absurd to say that Heart had authority, as the <em>agent </em>of Eyster, to make payment. The principal debtor agent for the surety, in paying his own debt! It is clear that Heart could make no <em>new express promise </em>that would bind Eyster. How, then, could the latter be bound by an act which gives but the implication of a promise ?</p>

It is, however, only a constructive acknowledgment; yet it is too late to require an express one. But it was some time undecided by the English courts how far a payment by a principal was, in contemplation of law, a payment by the surety in order to take the case out of the statute as to the latter. The decisions at length have settled that the payment of one is an acknowledgment by both, wherever it has been made during their joint responsibility — in other words, before it has been severed by the death of one of them. Burleigh <em>v. </em>Stott, 8 Barn. <em>&amp; </em>Cress. 36, was the case of an action on a joint and several promissory note, brought against the administrator of one of the makers who was a mere surety; to which the defendant pleaded that the cause of action had not accrued within six years; but the plaintiff gave evidence of payment within that period, being the intestate; and as it was made before the joint liability was severed by his death, the plaintiff was allowed to recover. The court went on the ground that the act of one joint contractor is the <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>act of the other, if performed while their responsibility remained the same as it was at first; and on this principle was decided Slater <em>v. </em>Lawson, 1 Barn. &amp; Ald. 396, in which the facts were exactly the same as the preceding, except that the payment was made after the death of the principal by his executrix; and Lord Tenterden, giving judgment, said that when the joint liability has been severed by the death of one of the parties, nothing can be done by his personal representative to arrest the progress of the statute as to the other. On the same principle is Atkins <em>v. Tredgold, 2 </em>Barn. &amp; Cress. 23, in which a payment by a surviving contractor, was not allowed to take the case out of the statute as to the representative of the other. In the preceding cases, the party to be charged by the acknowledgment or discharged by the statute, was a surety; but there is no apparent reason why the rule should not be applied to the case of principal contractors. Perhaps Whitcomb <em>v. </em>Whiting, Doug. 652, and Wood <em>v. </em>Braddick, 1 Taunt. 104, go that far. But it is very clear that a payment under a responsibility which was exclusively several fj-om the first, would stop the statute only as to the payor, and not as to a debtor who happened to be bound for the same debt only by a separate instrument. Now, though the payment here was made by the principal, yet the note on which suit is brought, is joint as well as several, and the makers are still alive; so that the ease is in all respects the same as Burleigh <em>v. </em>Stott, except that the action there was brought against the administrator of the surety, and here it is brought against the surety himself, in full life — a difference which is wholly immaterial. The plaintiffs therefore were entitled to recover.</p>
