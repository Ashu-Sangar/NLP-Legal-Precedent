      <em>May </em>31. This was an indictment against John Clellans and thirty-six others for a riot, accompanied with the aggravation of riotously rescuing from their owners certain fugitive slaves from the state of Maryland, who had been arrested in Cumberland county, in this state, and who were at the time of the rescue in the lawful custody and under the control of their owners, in the county aforesaid, to whom their service was due, under the laws of the state of Maryland. The indictment contained two counts. The <em>first </em>count was for a riot, in the common form; and the <em>second </em>for riotously rescuing certain fugitive slaves from the state of Maryland, who were found and arrested in this state, from the lawful custody of their owners or masters. The jury returned a verdict of <em>guilty </em>against <em>John Clellans and twelve others of the defendants, </em>and not guilty as to the other defendants. The sentence of the <a id="p224" href="#p224" data-label="224" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*224</a>court (Hepburn, P. J.) was as <em>follows: </em>— “Sept. 7, 1847. The sentence of the court is, that you, John Clella'ns, suffer punishment by separate or solitary confinement at labour in the State Penitentiary for the Eastern Distinct, for the period of three years • that you pay a fine of one dollar to the • commonwealth, and the costs of prosecution; and that you be in the custody of the sheriff until the sentence is complied with.” The same sentence was passed upon Jacob Garver, Moses Jones, Augustus Coates, Anthony Boon, John E. Gray, Achilles Yandegrift, Yalentine Thomas, George Norman, Charles Turner, and Henry Myers, ten others of the defendants. The other defendants, James Jones and Eli Butler, found guilty, were on the same day sentenced to imprisonment in the jail of Cumberland county.</p>

The punishment, according to the laws of England, was by fine and imprisonment; to which the pillory, in aggravated cases, was sometimes added: 2 Ch. Or. Law, 490; 1 Haw. PI.

Assault and battery with intent to commit a capital offence, as rape, or murder, or an attempt to commit the crime against nature (offences in their nature infamous), would fall within that class of offences described in the fourth section of the act of the 5th of April, 1790, as “offences not capital,” for which, by the laws in force before the act, entitled “ An act to amend the penal laws of the state,” burning in the hand, cutting off the ears, placing in the pillory, whipping, or imprisonment for life, was or might be inflicted. Many offences punished in England by infamous inflictions,' had not been so punished in Pennsylvania before the act to amend the penal laws, and I would not be disposed to be governed by such cases in this state, or apply them to the construction of our penal laws, nor expose any citizen to infamous punishment for undefined offences not in their nature infamous, at the discretion of any court: 6 S. &amp; R. 226. Again, the same learned judge, in James <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 12 S. &amp; R. 220, held, that the ducking-stool was abolished. This punishment had been ordered to be inflicted by a court in the city of Philadelphia, so late as 1824, on a female in that city who had been convicted as a common scold.
