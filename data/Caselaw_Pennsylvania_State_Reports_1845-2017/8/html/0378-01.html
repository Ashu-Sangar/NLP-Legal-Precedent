      <em>“ From </em>this evidence it appears, that neither of the subscribing witnesses saw Renno execute this bond; that his name was written to it when they attested it, and that the only execution of the instrument, which they saw, was by Miller. It is beyond doubt, however, that Renno did execute the bond, both from his own admissions to Conrad and Witman, and from the proof of his signature, by Mr. Smith. Subscribing witnesses are not necessary to the validity of a bond; their addition alters the mode of its proof. If there are no witnesses to a bond, the proof is directed at once to the handwriting of the obligor: if there are witnesses, they must be called; and this cannot be dispensed with where they are alive and within the jurisdiction, and capable of testifying. When they are dead, abroad, or incapable, it is enough to prove their handwriting, which in that case, in the words of Mr. Justice Duncan, 6 S. &amp; R. 811, £ is not only proof of the obligor’s signature, but it is presumption that it is a deed executed.’ Such being the difference of proof, where a deed is executed with or without subscribing witnesses, it seems to us that an alteration of it, after its execution, as respects the medium of proof, is a very material alteration of the instrument. As far as Renno was concerned, the bond was perfect, as to him, without witnesses; and it matters not that the addition of witnesses, in this particular case, could work no harm, and was made in ignorance or in innocence.</p>

In that case, the persons whose names appeared at the foot of the clause of attestation, were not present at any part of the act of execution; and one of them testified, that he subscribed his name at a subsequent time, when the obligee was going to assign the single bill, under a belief that he was called as a witness to the assignment, on which, it was held, the court properly left the jury to decide whether the alteration of the instrument was fraudulent or accidental. In the present, the witnesses saw one of the obligors, Miller, sign and seal; and the jury ought to have been instructed to inquire whether the form of the clause of attestation was purposely made general, by the contrivance of the obligee, to import an attestation of execution by both obligors, or whether it was done ignorantly and accidentally. If the witnesses <a id="p381" href="#p381" data-label="381" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*381</a>subscribed it as it was prepared, without being practised upon by the obligee, the bond was valid. When Renno sealed it, he knew that it was to be sealed by Miller; and, instead of insisting on having separate witnesses to his separate act of execution, he consented to the course which was subsequently taken, and, therefore, to the consequences of it; but it is well settled that an innocent alteration does not vitiate. Where joint obligors sign and seal separately, it is usual to have separate sets of attesting witnesses; and had the scrivener, in this instance, specially noted, as he ought to have done, that the witnesses subscribed to attest the act of Miller alone, there would have been neither doubt nor difficulty, as to the validity of the instrument. The fact of execution by Renno would have been left open to general proof of his handwriting or acknowledgment; and what reasonable objection can he have to let the case stand on that foot as it is ? Had the witnesses died or gone beyond the jurisdiction of the court, proof of their handwriting would have been <em>primd facie </em>proof of execution by Renno as well as by- Miller ; but the fact might have been disproved, if the truth wrere so, by witnesses to the character of Renno’s handwriting, or the presumption from general attestation might have been rebutted by the testimony of the scrivener, or any other person present at the transaction. If Renno could not disprove his signature because it was genuine, there would be no harm done. The day for invalidating deeds for accidental alterations, even in material parts, has long gone by; and had the cause been put to the jury upon the honesty of the ease, there is no doubt that the verdict would have accorded with the justice of it.</p>
