If the plaintiff fails, he may recover his debt from the witness with costs; but not the costs of this action. If he recovers, the defendant may recover from him his debt and the costs of both actions. The witness was consequently interested.\nThe other point also was properly ruled. A creditor who lets the means of satisfaction slip from his hands, discharges his debtor\u2019s surety; but he must have had the means actually in his hands, or at least a specific lien on it. Permissive supineness will not do it. In the United States v. Simpson, 3 Penns. Rep. 439, the surety was not discharged though the creditor had suffered the lien of a judgment against the principal to expire. That was thought to be a different thing from impairing a security by a positive act,\u201d the surety and the creditor standing in equal want of equity. Had the surety in this instance required the creditor to proceed on his execution, the case would have been different; but it was his business to look after his own interest. The very point seems to have been ruled at Harrisburg in Cathcart\u2019s Appeal, 1 Har. 416.\nJudgment affirmed.",

Morrison on his recognisance of bail for stay of execution, in a judgment obtained by plaintiffs against Hamnet and Schoyer.\nOn the judgment against Hamnet and Schoyer a fi. fa. had issued, which was stayed by order of plaintiff\u2019s attorney. No levy had been made upon it.\nOn the trial, the deposition of Hamnet was offered, on the part of defendant, to prove that an arrangement had been made between himself and Mr. Bigham, plaintiff\u2019s attorney, which discharged Morrison.\nThe deposition was rejected.\nOn same side, it was also offered to be proved by McMillan, that at the time the fi. fa. against Hamnet, one of the principal debtors, was in the hands of the sheriff, and which was stayed by order of plaintiff\u2019s attorney, that Hamnet had sufficient personal property in his possession to pay the debt.\nThe evidence was rejected.\nVerdict for plaintiffs.\nErrors assigned:\n1. In rejecting the deposition of John Hamnet.\n2. In rejecting the evidence of McMillan.\nThe case was argued by Washington, for plaintiff in error.\nMagraw, for defendant in error."
