        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nGibson, C. J.\n\u2014 This action is brought by an equitable tenant in common, as a substitute for a bill in equity, to recover his share of the price of land sold by his co-tenant and trustee of the legal estate. The plaintiff and his trustee, the defendant\u2019s testator, accepted a part of their intestate father\u2019s real estate at the valuation in the Orphans\u2019 Court; but as the choice was made by the testator, as the actor, the title was vested in him exclusively. The foundation of the claim is a resulting trust in a moiety of the land sold by the testator. In equity, the brothers were tenants in common, the testator being a trustee of the plaintiff\u2019s moiety. This is the aspect in which the case must be viewed, to found the action. The testator sold the whole, with the plaintiff\u2019s assent, to another brother, the defendant, who purchased with notice of the trust, and, at the testators\u2019s death, became his executor. The subject of the action, therefore, had no connexion with the subject of the defendant\u2019s administration account; and how it could have been involved in the settlement of it and the decree of confirmation, it is impossible to tell. No part of the assets could come to the plaintiff; and in that respect the case is stronger than Weiting v. Nissley, 1 Harris 650, in which the party entitled to the estate was not bound by the settlement, because the Orphans\u2019 Court had not jurisdiction of the particular matter. In the present case, the defendant is sued for a debt said to be due by him, not as an executor, but as a purchaser of the plaintiff\u2019s equity; and whether the plaintiff was in truth an equitable owner; whether the defendant had paid over the purchase money in ignorance of the trust; or whether it was still in his hands \u2014 no matter whether as purchaser or executor\u2014 were questions which could not be agitated at the settlement of the administration account. They are questions which cannot arise in any case specified in the nineteenth section of the act of 1836, by which the jurisdiction of the Orphans\u2019 Court is limited and defined. They arise in England only on a bill in equity between vendor and vendee; and here, only in an equitable action, as a substitute for it. The present is such an action, and there consequently can be no question about survivorship of remedy. If the plaintiff\u2019s money is in the defendant\u2019s hands \u2014 no matter how \u2014 he must pay it without regard to the claims of the testator\u2019s creditors, because it is no part of the assets. View the case as if the vendee and the executor of the vendor were different persons, and as if the legatees were attempting to surcharge the administration account with the entire price of the land: what would the plaintiff, a stranger to the will, and the vendee, equally so, have to do with it ? Neither would be estopped by tbe decree, because neither would be a party to it. The defendant happens to be both purchaser and executor; but a man\u2019s acts take their character and consequences from the capacity in which they were done. Even if he could have been a party to the decree as a purchaser, the plaintiff was not a party to it as a vendor; and it is a trite rule of .evidence that a party who would not have benefited by a judgment had it been in his favor, shall not be prejudiced by it as an estoppel when it is against him. The admission of the Orphans\u2019 Court proceedings in evidence, therefore, and the direction consequent on it, were erroneous.\nJudgment reversed and venire de novo awarded.",

Canon against Andrew M. Work, (who was plaintiff in error,) to recover a balance of purchase money for land sold by John Work to the said Andrew M. Work.\nA verdict was rendered in favor of the plaintiff below, for $337.26.\nJohn Work, deceased, took part of his father\u2019s real estate, (a farm and mills,) at the valuation of $3000, upon proceedings in the Orphans\u2019 Court, for himself and his brother, Alexander Work. John Work and Alexander Work could not pay the heirs their purparts ; and they sold the farm to their brother, Andrew M. Work, the defendant below and the plaintiff in error in this case. Some time after, John Work, one of the tenants in common, died, and made his brother, Andrew M. Work, one of his executors. Andrew M. Work then occupied two relations, that of executor, and also vendee of the land. He was compelled to settle his administration account, which was referred to an auditor, who charged him with the balance due of purchase money of the land. Before the auditor, amongst other matters, A. M. Work insisted that his mother\u2019s dower was a lien on the land, and that he ought to retain for it. But the auditor decided the point against him, which was confirmed by the court, and is unappealed from. Alexander Work, the surviving owner of the land, assigned the balance of the purchase money to Canon, who had paid off one of the heirs his purpart, which was a lien on the land, in order to satisfy it, and which A. M. Work was bound to pay. This suit was brought in the name of Alex. Work, for the use of Canon, to recover the balance of purchase money due for the land.\nBills of exception were taken by the plaintiff in error to the admission of the auditor\u2019s report, and the assignment from Work to Canon.\nGilmore, J., charged, inter alia.*\nAlexander Work, for the use of James F. Canon, now seeks to recover the balance of purchase money in the hands of Andrew M. Work. The defendant objects, and among other matters, alleges that he has been compelled to extinguish the widow\u2019s dower, which was secured by recognizance, and for this he has paid $300-. But the question of this lien was before the auditor and passed upon, and the court charge that in this action the decree of the Orphans\u2019 Court confirming this report is conclusive in this action, and the correctness of the auditor\u2019s decision cannot be questioned in this suit, and that if the jury believe that Alexander Work was tenant in common with his brother, John Work, in this land, part of which was sold to Andrew M. Work, he, as survivor, could maintain this action of debt, to recover from the defendant.the balance of any purchase money remaining due and unpaid, and that the auditor\u2019s report fixing the amount, and the decree of the court confirming the report, is conclusive. The court, therefore, charge you, that the auditor does pass upon the question, whether the recognizance securing the widow\u2019s dower is a lien, and decide that it is not, and that no deduction should be made to the accountant on this account, and that this report, having been confirmed, is conclusive. Therefore, the only question for your determination is, whether Alex. Work was tenant in common with his brother*, and for the proof of this you are referred to the evidence, &c.\nIt was assigned for error, that the court erred in admitting in evidence the report of the auditor, and in admitting the assignment of Alexander Work to Canon.\nThe case was argued by Sowell, with whom was Oliphant, for plaintiff in error, defendant below. \u2014 He contended, inter alia, that if the balance belonged to Alexander Work, plaintiff below, he should have appeared before the auditor and objected to its being charged against defendant below, as executor.\nJ. H. Deford, with whom was A. Patterson, for defendant in error.\n\u2014 The auditor\u2019s report was offered merely as record evidence of the amount of purchase money due for the land."
