    <p class="summary" id="b212-10" data-blocks='[["BL_212.8",212,[337,1484,1191,948]],["BL_213.1",213,[156,389,1206,303]]]'>The court, Church, J., charged, <em>inter alia: </em>— It is a well-settled rule of law, that when, by the terms of a contract, the performance of the stipulations therein on part of plaintiff forms the considera-' tion and condition for the performance on part of defendant, it maybe considered as precedent to the right to recover; and unless the plaintiff shows a substantial compliance with such precedent condition, or some act or course of conduct on part of defendants showing a waiver of it, he must fail. A slight and immaterial failure or omission on part of plaintiff will not affect him. It must be in substance and material; something which in its character and extent goes to the very essence of the consideration as an entirety. This note is only payable on condition the clock performs to the satisfaction of defendants — not an arbitrary satisfaction — they are bound to be satisfied, and may be deemed to be so unless there be some substantial and just cause for dissatisfaction. If, then, you find that the clock was materially defective, and did not keep correct, regular time, nor strike correctly, regularly, and the hands on the dials did not indicate uniform similar time, these would justify the defendants in their dissatisfaction, and form a defence here. And if the plaintiff was to put the clock up and make it so perform, or else not have payment on the note as expressed in the note, the fact that the clock has remained where plaintiff <a id="p213" href="#p213" data-label="213" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*213</a>left it until the suit brought, makes no difference. Defendants were not bound to return it unless an opportunity has been offered; especially if the residence of the plaintiff is at a distance, and unknown to defendants. They do not seek to recover, but to prevent a recovery against them. If there was only a slight defect, make _ such deduction as is right and just under the evidence, and as will make it good as stipulated for.</p>

Such was the sale in Humphreys <em>v. </em>Carvalho, 16 <em>East </em>45, and many other cases, which it is unnecessary to quote, the principle being settled; and the business is to apply it to the evidence. The defendant promised to pay the price at the expiration of a year, on condition that the clock should perform to the satisfaction of the burgess and town council, or their successors. The corporation, consequently, had a year to signify its determination. This is not a case of warranty, and it is immaterial whether the clock performed well or ill; it was the business of the burgess and council to judge of that, and keep the clock or return it, at the proper time. It was put up, and the plaintiff, who was probably a clock pedlar, went away. The burgess and council were ultimately dissatisfied with it, and after two years, took it down, but did not offer to return it, or attempt to give notice of their dissatisfaction. Three witnesses testified that they had not heard of the plaintiff’s whereabout, then or since; the other witnesses were silent in respect to it. It is clear and indisputable law, that the burgess and council were bound to give notice of their dissatisfaction, with an offer to return the clock, or attempt to do it. They were not bound to follow the <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>plaintiff to a foreign country; but if foreign residence had been alleged, they would have been bound to prove it. If his residence was unknown, they were bound to prove that they had attempted to discover it. If it was known to be in a sister State, they were [ bound to prove that they had attempted to reach him through the post-office. But there was not a spark of evidence to prove that any effort had been made whatever <em>i </em>and the contract had become absolute. The cause, therefore, was not put on its proper point.</p>
