They gave him a deed, and <em>took </em>his bond and mortgage on the lot to secure the balance of the purchase money. This mortgage continued a lien on the lot till the treasurer’s sale. The lot was sold in 1840, by the treasurer, to Kelly, for unpaid taxes, and there was a surplus of the purchase money remaining after payment of the taxes. The surplus amounted to $243.34-|-. Kelly, the purchaser, executed a bond for the surplus to the treasurer, for the use of the last owner of the lot.</p>

The plaintiff in error contended that under said act, the borough, as a lien creditor, has no other or greater right than the last owner of said lot, and that the right of Schwarze having been divested by the aforesaid attachment, the right of the lien creditor, the borough, was also divested. 4</p>
