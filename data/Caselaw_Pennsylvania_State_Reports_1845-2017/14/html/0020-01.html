J. — The record of an action in a State whose jurisprudence is founded on the common law, of which a court judicially takes notice without proof of the fact, consists of the writ, declaration, pleas, and judgment, and this, when properly authenticated, is sufficient to found an action of debt in a court of a sister State, <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>with the effect not merely of a foreign judgment hut of a judgment by a court in the same State. It was unnecessary, therefore, for the plaintiff to exhibit more, particularly an exemplification of the executions, or the marginal entries on the minutes of the <em>bill </em>and. decree in equity. As the effect of the latter was to show the amount which had not been collected, it would be the business of the defendant to produce them, were not the credits admitted by the plaintiffs; and it is immaterial to the issue before me, therefore, whether they were authenticated according to the act of Congress or not. What we have to do with then, is the certificate to authenticate what is properly the record. The judge styles himself in it “ the president judge of the twelfth judicial district of the State of Ohio; which district <em>includes </em>Clark county, in said State of Ohioand the objection is that he does not style himself president judge of the Court of Common Pleas of Clark county. It is true the act of Congress requires the certificate to be the act of the “judge, chief justice, or presiding magistrate, as the case may be,” and consequently of the particular court in which the record is; but are we not to infer from this certificate that the judge was the presiding magistrate of all the courts which composed the district, and consequently of the Common Pleas of Clark county ? If he was a president judge, it was of some court; and if not of each court in his district, of which court else ? We are not to scrutinize the words of such a certificate as the words of an indictment, but to give them a reasonable construction, and above all, not to wrest them from their natural import. It is justly said by Professor (xreenleaf, in his Law of Evidence, Part III. s. 504, that though the States of the Union are, in all things not surrendered to the general government, to be treated between themselves as foreign states, yet that “their domestic relations are rather those of domestic independence than of foreign alienation;” and we are consequently at liberty to look into the constitution and laws of a State for the structure of its judiciary, because its officers share, to the extent involved in the present question, in the distributive justice of the wdiole United States.</p>

That the exact style of t'he office is not necessarily to be expressed, was determined in the Commonwealth vs. Leib, 1 <em>Watts Serg. </em>251, a case nearer to the present in principle, if not in circumstances, than any that has been quoted. By the constitution of Pennsylvania, judges of the Common Pleas are commissioned as such without any other official title; yet they are <em>virtute officii </em>judges of Oyer and Terminer, of Quarter Sessions, and of the Orphans’ Court; yet it was held in that case, that an official bond which a statute required to be approved of by the judges of <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>tbe Quarter Sessions, was good though it was approved of by the actual judges of the Quarter Sessions, styling themselves judges of the Common Pleas. On the same principle it was held in Kean <em>v. </em>Franklin, 5 <em>Serg. Rawle </em>154 , that a recognizance to the president of the Orphans’ Court was valid, though no judge is expressly so denominated in the constitution. But even without pretending to take judicial cognizance of the structure of the courts in Ohio, we would be led by a reasonable and fair interpretion of this certificate, to say that the certifying judge was the presiding magistrate of every court within his district, and of the Common Pleas of Clark county among the rest.</p>

Objection was early taken, that the attested copy obtained was imperfect; it contained only the record proper under the Ohio statutes, and did not contain copies of the executions and other matter, which is no part of a record in Ohio. <em>Swann’s Statutes of Ohio, </em>678. To obviate the objection, the plaintiff produced four distinct attestations: — 1. An attestation of the mere record proper. 2. An attestation of certain minutes and statements, showing the actual present balance due on the judgment. 3. The execution entries. 4. The last attestation includes all matter comprised by the three former attestations, and covers matter, whether of record proper, or of judicial proceedings <em>merely. </em>The act of Congress uses the words “ records and judicial proceedings of the courts of any State.” The fourth attestation, covering all the records and judicial proceedings in the case, must needs comprise every thing which could legitimately come within the province of the clerk’s attestation, and not more. If this be protected by a certificate of the president judge, the case is with the defendant on another ground besides that taken by the chief justice. He contended that the certificate was sufficient. That is not liable to the criticism upon the first certificate, for the judge who certifies is in the fourth certificate stated to be the “ presiding magistrate of the court.”</p>
