The defendant pleads not guilty. On the trial, the plaintiff offered an award and proceedings in a former action of trespass by plaintiff against defendant, to July term, 1845. The arbitrators, who were appointed under the act of 16th June, 1836, reported “that they are of opinion, and do award, that there is due to the plaintiff from the defendant the sum of <em>$10. </em>And by consent.of parties, the arbitrators were authorized to fix and define the line between them, (and other matters connected therewith,) so as to avoid all controversy and dispute hereafter upon the subject. They therefore define the line as follows, viz.,” &amp;c., — “ and that the defendant put and keep up a spout on the south side of his stable, so as to conduct the water that falls upon the roof off the land of the plaintiff. It is understood that nothing herein contained shall interfere with or prevent either party from appealing from said awards — and if appealed from, the rights of neither party shall be prejudiced by any thing therein stated.”</p>

After the arbitrators had met, and certain evidence had been heard, “ it occurred to me it was more important to have the matter settled, rather than how it was settled. I suggested to John W. Babb that the arbitrators should have the whole matter committed to them ; he thought it would be well, but declined to give any authority to do so. He and I had a private conversation about it; he declined giving any authority, and said he had none, and said it was impossible to consult with his father because of his sickness. I then stated to the arbitrators that they might state a line or recommend a line, and if the award was not appealed from, it might be binding on the parties. There was nothing said about the spout.” He further said: “I may have stated that the arbitrators might state a line, and if not appealed from, be final.”</p>

The first had regard to a trespass: the second, to a boundary. That a question of boundary is a subject of arbitration, is plain upon principle as well as authority. An award is an act of the parties performed through their agents, and assented to in advance; and there is no reason why they may not as well establish, by-means of it, what is called, in common parlance,1 “a consentable line,” as by their immediate act. And the cases abundantly prove that an attorney is competent to bind his client; so that the question before the jury was whether the question of boundary had actually been submitted. The award of damages was under the first submission: the award of boundary, at the common law, was under the parol submission, and dependent on the written one for the right of appeal, by which both awards might be annulled. The spout was not within either submission, and the award was so far void. If there was a parol submission, the award of the boundary would conclude the parties in subsequent suits. The question was one of fact, and if there was any affirmative evidence whatever, it was proper to send it to the jury. The plaintiff was present in person at the meeting of the arbitrators, and the defendant was present by his attorney, who, wisely judging it better to have the controversy settled wrong than not to have it entirely settled, proposed that the “arbitrators might state a line, or recommend a line, and that, if the award was not appealed from, it might be binding on the parties.” He thought he was proposing to submit the whole matter, for nothing less could bind. No objection being made on the other side, the arbitrators reported a line-; and as no appeal was taken, the award would, on the terms proposed, become absolute. Now, it is not pretended that there.. <a id="p400" href="#p400" data-label="400" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*400</a>was, in this, an explicit submission expressly offered and accepted; but a parol submission, like any other parol agreement, depends on the assent of the parties ; and it may be signified by acts as well as words. The defendant’s attorney certainly proposed an additional article; the plaintiff did not object to it; and the arbitrators proceeded on the basis of it. To say nothing of acts of confirmation, there was enough in this to send the question to the jury. The record was competent to lay a ground for evidence of subsequent submission; and the cause was in all respects properly ruled.</p>
