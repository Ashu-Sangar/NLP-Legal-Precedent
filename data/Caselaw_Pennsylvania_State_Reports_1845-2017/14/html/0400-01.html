By an indenture made March 6th, 1838, the said John and Joseph Wright let the said premises to Thomas D. Dougherty and Jacob W.

There was an agreement in the lease, that Dougherty and Souder might rent any part or parts of said premises, except the store, during their term. By a memorandum made Sept. 15th, 1838, the Messrs.

Wright are entitled, as the landlords mentioned in the act of 1836, relating to executions, to the amount of rent reserved to them in their lease to Dougherty and Souder, out of the proceeds of the execution against the goods of the defendant Hopewell, who was the under-lessee. The plaintiff contends that Gratz, the original landlord, alone has a claim under the act, and as he has waived his claim, it exists in no one. The claim on behalf of the Wrights is, that <em>they </em>are the landlords mentioned in the act, and that the goods on the premises, being liable to their distress, should satisfy the rent reserved to them in their lease. We find but one authority applicable to this point, viz. the case of Bennett, reported in <em>Strange </em>787, who was ground landlord of a house, in which an under-lessee dwelt, against whom there was an execution; it was held that Bennett was not entitled to rent out of the proceeds of the execution, and that the statute of Ann. c. 14, under which he claimed, extended only to the <em>immediate </em>landlord of the party whose goods-are subject to an execution. This question was started in the case-of Ege <em>v. </em>Ege, <a href="/watts/5/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts 134" data-case-ids="1844070" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0134-01">5 <em>Watts </em>134</a>, but was not decided, being immaterial to the case, which was disposed of on other grounds. The act of Assembly of 1772 was taken from the statute 8 Ann. c. 14; and there seems to be no reason why it should not bear the same con<a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>struction as regards the present question. The 88d section of the act of 1836 contains the additional proviso, that the goods and chattels, &amp;c., taken in execution, there mentioned, must be such as are “ liable to the distress of the landlord.” The object of this provision, it is conceived, can only be to exempt from liability to satisfy rent, such goods as are commonly exempted from a distress, but which, without such provision, would go to pay rent when sold under an execution; otherwise, there seems to be no force in this provision, as all goods on the premises, except those particularly exempted by the common law, or otherwise, are liable to the distress of the landlord.</p>

(Bennett’s case.) This rule, then settled, has ever since been adhered to in England, and is now the law of that country, as is shown by the modern case of Thorsgood <em>v. </em>Richardson, 7 <em>Bing. </em>420. In this particular, our act of 1772 is a transcript of the British statute, and the act of 1836 differs from it only in the additional proviso that the goods and chattels taken in execution must be such as are “ liable to the distress of the landlord.” It is said, the language of this proviso is indicative of a legislative intent to confer the right to a year’s rent upon any of the lessors who might have distrained the goods of the tenant, and is, thus, introductive of a principle different from that which obtains under the statute of Anne. But, for the reason given by the auditor, we agree with him that the object of this provision is to exempt from liability to satisfy rent such goods as are commonly exempted from distress, but which would, without the provision, be subject to the payment of rent when sold under an execution; and not to create <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>a right, before then unknown to the law. We are to take it for granted the lawmakers were aware of the doctrine established by prior adjudications. If so, it is impossible to believe they contemplated a change so radical and important, without employing language better fitted to express it. The argument which favors an intended alteration proceeds upon the ground that the right to demand rent from the sheriff is, necessarily, a concomitant of the power of distress. But the decisions show that the one is not always dependent on the other. Though the right to demand does not, perhaps, exist independently of the power to distrain, the latter is not, of itself alone, sufficiently potent to give birth to the former. It would seem there must also be an agreement, express or implied, as the foundation of the landlord’s privilege to come in under an execution. And there is reason in this, of which the case before us furnishes an illustration. Hopewell rented but part of the whole premises from Dougherty and Souder, and yet the Messrs. Wright claim to receive the whole amount of rent reserved to them for the <em>whole proyerty^ </em>by their demise to Dougherty and Souder. Again, the Wrights agreed to pay to G-ratz $1500 ■per annum, while they leased to Dougherty and Souder for $1200. If the middle men are entitled to come in on the fund in the hands of the sheriff, so is the original lessor, and thus the tenant’s goods would be liable to pay not only what his immediate landlord agreed to pay, but larger sums contracted for by preceding tenants. These considerations show the propriety of adhering to the contract of the parties as the foundation of the right, and this will confine it to the immediate landlord. That is the basis upon which it is authoritatively held the British legislature proceeded, and no sufficient reason has been suggested to induce the belief that our legislature intended differently. It is not enough to say the preceding lessors might have distrained on the same goods for the whole amount of the rent due to them respectively, and, therefore, there is no harshness in making those goods subject, in the hands of the sheriff, for the same amounts. The answer is, that although, to a certain extent, the statutory claim of the landlord was intended as a compensation for balking his remedy by distress, there is nothing in the statute to show it was intended to be commensurate with the multiplications of the remedy which might be created by successive demises. Without, however, further elaboration of the argument, it may be sufficient to repeat that the, right was restrained to the immediate landlord by the interpretation at Westminster, and there is nothing to show an intent to introduce a different rule in this country.</p>
