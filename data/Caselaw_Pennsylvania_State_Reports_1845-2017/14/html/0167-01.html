It will be observed that the claimant gives a credit in his claim for $96.42; the defendant below not having made appropriation at the time of payment, the mechanic has the right to do so. On the trial of this cause below, the defendant made no attempt to deny that the work was performed, and that the mechanic faithfully earned his claim, and the jury, by their verdict, have disposed of all the technical objections to the claim.</p>

The act of the 18th June, 1886, section 12, directs that the claim should set forth the time when the materials were furnished or the work was done, as the case may be. I think, in this ease, there was a substantial compliance with the act. The defendant in error was a stone-mason, and his claim is filed for stone-mason work. The building is well described. His claim is for the work, and for the stone, lime, and sand, done and found, within six months past, viz., between the <em>1st </em>June, 1848, and the 1st April, 1849. The bill is given, but it has no other date. The lien is filed for a specific sum, and it specifies the particular work done. It was for this work done and materials found, six months before the claim filed. The case of Shaw <em>v. </em>Barnes, 5 <em>Barr </em>20, is a direct authority to support this judgment. There the claim was for plastering within six months before the claim filed. This court there said, that these claims are frequently filed by mechanics unaccustomed to legal forms. We allow a claim which is defective in form to be stricken off, on motion and rule, from the record; but after a trial on the merits, technical objections are disregarded by this court.</p>
