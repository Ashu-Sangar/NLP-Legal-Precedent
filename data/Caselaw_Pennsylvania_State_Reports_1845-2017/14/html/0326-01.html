Robert Jones was a resident of Cincinnati, to which place he removed from Greene county. Schacklett &amp; Glyde issued a foreign attachment against him to No. 22 of March term, 1847, which was duly executed on the 18th January, 1847, upon the real estate of the defendant in the county of Greene. On the 22d of January, 1847, an appearance by counsel, and pleas were entered for the defendant. At June term, 1847, the cause was set down for trial by the plaintiffs, when it was continued by the court upon the application of the defendant. It was again put upon the trial list for September term, 1847, by the plaintiffs, when it was continued a second time, upon a like application. At <em>November term, </em>1848, the. cause was reached for <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>trial, when a verdict and judgment were rendered for the plaintiffs. <em>In the mean time </em>attachments were sued out by others, which were executed upon the same real estate upon which the attachment of Schacklett &amp; Glyde was laid, and judgments were also confessed by Jones, as follows:</p>

This continued to be the law until 1759, when it was enacted that lands could only be sold after condemnation, &amp;c. It was under this state of things that the act of 1705 was passed,, which was construed to embrace lands. There is nothing in any of these acts, prior to 1836, nor in any of the adjudicated cases, that recognises the doc<a id="p329" href="#p329" data-label="329" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*329</a>trine insisted on by the appellant. <em>Doubtless, </em>a lien attached as to personal property, arising from its changeable nature; and the officer, if possible, was to take actual possession of the goods attached.

Nor ought they to have done otherwise; at least they did not. The assertion of counsel in McClenachan <em>v. </em>McCarty, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Dal.%20376" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Dal. 376">1 <em>Dal. </em>376</a>, and Ludlow <em>v. </em>Bingham, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Dal.%2055" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="4 Dal. 55">4 <em>Dal. </em>55</a>, uncontradicted as it was in either case by the opposing counsel or the court, is proof of the contemporaneous construction. Mr. Justice Sergeant expresses a belief, in his Treatise, p. 63, that many titles depend on sales by execution on judgments in foreign attachment. As land was not mentioned in the statute, it was not expressly said that an attachment should bind it; but lien was attributable to the execution of the writ as a necessary consequence of a common law principle which creates it whenever property is seized to make satisfaction. A levy on a <em>testatum </em>execution binds the land, though the judgment does not; and it was held in Todd <em>v. </em>McCulloch, 3 <em>Da. Rep. </em>404, and Brown <em>v. </em>Campbell, <a href="/watts/1/0041-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Watts 41" data-case-ids="1838080" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0041-01">1 <em>Watts </em>41</a>, that the lien of an execution levied on a particular tract, survived the lien of the judgment. Though a judgment does not bind a personal chattel, an execution does; and as land is a chattel for purposes of satisfaction, it may be bound by the common law lien of an execution independent of the lien of the judgment by construction of the statute of Westminster the second. The primary intent of a <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>foreign attachment wás doubtless to compel the debtor to put in bail, and, till that was done, the property attached was bound, and so far as it was involved, it answered the purpose of an appearance ; in which respect the execution of an attachment is a species of levy in anticipation of the judgment.. Since the act of .1836, which allows him to enter a common appearance and defend without dissolving the attachment, the primary intent is to sequestrate the property. But it was not intended that a common appearance should impair the lien, or it would have been discharged as well in favor of mortgagees and purchasers as of judgment creditors. The case of a creditor who can raise money on a hypothecation of his land by judgment as readily as by mortgage, is as distinctly within the mischief intended to be prevented, as the case of a mortgagee or a purchaser. But the act of 1836, which expressly declares and defines the lien, restricts it to protection against mortgagees or purchasers, in terms. “ Every writ of attachment executed on real estate,” it is said, “shall bind the same against purchasers and mortgageesand judgment creditors are neither. The clause, however, is but another proof that every codification of the law must necessarily be lame and imperfect, though executed by the ablest hands. The case of a judgment creditor is not within the letter of it, but it is within its equity; and the letter would die did not construction come to its assistance. It would be eluded by a very obvious and simple contrivance — a judgment acknowledged for money borrowed. The interpretation necessary to frustrate it, is not more strained than that which was put on the act of 1798, to limit the duration of liens by judgment <em>inter </em>vivos, which, though the declared object of it was the protection of purchasers, was extended by construction to the protection of subsequent judgment creditors. The difference here is, that the protection is against them. ■ To prevent the machinery of a code from cutting the merits of particular cases to pieces, it is necessary that it be fitted, its mistakes corrected, and its deficiencies supplied, by judicial interpretation, after experience has disclosed them: without which it would work badly, or not at all.</p>
