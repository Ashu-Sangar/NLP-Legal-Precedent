In the ease of a proceeding by attachment under the 27th section of the act of 12th July, 1842, to abolish imprisonment for debt, where the justice had entered a non-suit on account of a copy of the attachment not having been served upon defendant, a bond given under the proviso to that section, is binding on the sureties of the plaintiff in the proceeding, even though the latter clause, as <em>to failure in the action, </em>has been omitted in it.</p>

Where such an attachment has been levied on property of the defendant therein, and a non-suit has been entered by the justice on account of defendant not having been served with a copy of the attachment, the condition of the bond of the plaintiff and his sureties is thereby broken, and the defendant in the original proceeding may recover upon it.</p>

This instrument, with the endorsement upon it, is part of the plaintiff’s evidence. The defendant asks the court, in his first point, here read, to say to the jury that <em>the bond on which the suit is brought is void, and the plaintiff cannot recover, </em>and he gives several reasons for this in his argument: one is, that it is not conformable to the statute, as it does not embrace the two conditions which the statute prescribes. The court, however, dissents from this reason, <em>as the omission complained of is more in ease of the defendant than otherwise. </em>Another is, that the penalty is more than double the amount which the plaintiff before the justice claimed; but then the statute requires such penalty to be at least double the amount claimed, and imports, therefore, that a larger one may be taken, if the justice thinks proper. The court, then, instructs the jury that the bond is not void, so as to prevent plaintiff from recovering. In the defendant’s second point, he asks the court that the judgment of non-suit given by the justice was illegal, and did not work a forfeiture of the bond. But the court replies to the jury, that under the evidence, this is not a true <a id="p416" href="#p416" data-label="416" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*416</a>statement of the law in .the case. His third point is, that there is no evidence in the cause showing a forfeiture of the bond. There is evidence, however, that the parties in the attachment suit appeared before the justice, and after hearing, the defendant, who is plaintiff here, claimed a non-suit on account of the attachment not being legally served and returned, which non-suit the justice granted on account of the defendant’s not being furnished with a copy. And there is evidence also that two horses of the plaintiff in the suit now trying, had been taken under tho attachment and moved to his neighbor’s place. This evidence shows, if the jury believes it, that the bond is forfeited. The condition of the bona is, that Albanus Gillingham shall obtain a judgment of at least one-half his demand of $87.53, in the attachment suit in which it was given; and the judgment of the justice shows that he recovered nothing; for, according to the case of Gould <em>v. </em>Crawford, 2 <em>Barr </em>89, the non-suit granted by him being unapjDealed from, is ■ conclusive. If therefore the jury finds the facts as stated, the condition of the bond has been broken, and the plaintiff may recover the reasonable damages he has sustained in consequence of such taking of his horses. With those observations, this third point is negatived by the court. The defendant’s fourth point is also negatived, the principle stated in it being inapplicable to this caso. The jury will then take the testimony, and without any intimation from the court in regard to it, find the facts for themselves ; and on the facts and tho principles of law which have been stated, make up their verdict. It is proper, however, to add, that the plaintiff has received his horses back, and cannot, therefore, recover damages for them according to their value. What he is entitled to, if the jury finds damages at all, is a reasonable com pensation for the taking and detention of them, if they were taken and detained from him as he alleges, and the consequent loss of their use, and interruption of his business during the time he was so deprived, &amp;c.</p>
