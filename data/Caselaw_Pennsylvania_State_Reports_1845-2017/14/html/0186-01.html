But this pretext is almost too barefaced to require a serious answer. It is not the proceeds of the square the uses of which the city councils are authorized to declare, but it is the property itself which is vested in them for public uses, and to no private use can they possibly apply it. Their power over it is restricted and circumscribed; it is not theirs to sell or to dispose of: they may control it within their right, and designate the use, but can go no further. What difference is it to what use the proceeds are applied ? The property is not theirs for sale. The use to which it is to be applied is but a debt — the private debt of the corporation; and it is violating the first principle of a trust when the trustee attempts to apply the trust property to his own use or to make money out of it. The city authorities, therefore, had no right to sell this property, and the title of the purchasers derived from them is wholly defective, and can avail them nothing.</p>

A public nuisance is certainly contrary to law, and this ingredient to give us jurisdiction is not wanting. The argument that the title to this public square is in the city of Allegheny, and that, therefore, the lot-holders and the public can have but an equity, is, I think, not tenable. The existence of a grantee is not essential to the dedication of a square to public use, and those who purchase lots according to a plan of a town containing such dedication, have a right to the streets, squares, &amp;c., as an appurtenant to their lots.

Thus, we find in Bain and Boslar, <em>Amb. </em>158, and 3 <em>Atk. </em>750, a motion was made for an injunction to stay the building of a house in which to inoculate for the small-pox.

Thus, if there were sufficient ground to believe, in consequence of threats or otherwise, that an individual was about committing waste in timber, &amp;c., or that a corporation was grossly abusing its privileges, <a id="p196" href="#p196" data-label="196" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*196</a>or that a public officer was destroying or about to destroy public books, &amp;c., or, in short, any act was doing, or likely to be done, for which damages could not, perhaps, compensate, and the legal redress might be too tardy and inefficient, which was in the nature of misfeasance, nuisance, waste, spoil, or destruction of property, and the act was contrary to law and injurious to the community or individuals, a summary remedy is given, by the strong arm of an injunction, to stop it, or prevent its being done.”</p>
