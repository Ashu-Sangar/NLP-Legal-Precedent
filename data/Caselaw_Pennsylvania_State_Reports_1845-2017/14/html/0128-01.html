    <p class="summary" id="b128-7" data-blocks='[["BL_128.6",128,[325,917,1180,506]]]'>These were actions of ejectment, brought by McKibbin to recover the possession of three lots of ground, in the city of Allegheny. The plaintiff claimed under a treasurer’s deed to him, dated. July 21, 1842, made in pursuance of a sale for taxes. The lots were assessed after 7th December, 1839, perhaps in January, February, or March, 1840. The Charltons had purchased about two acres of ground in 1837; they sold the lots in question out of it to Blakely, and conveyed them to him by deed, dated June 10, 1839. The lots in question were not cultivated in 1839, but they had been cultivated before, and were cultivated afterwards. The lots in controversy were enclosed by an outer fence, enclosing about two acres.</p>

This lot was in cultivation the year before the assessment and the year after it, the interruption having been occasioned by a sale of it for a building lot to one who was not prepared to make instant use of it. In the mean time it was not thrown out as a common, but suffered to remain enclosed, along with the vendor’s unsold lots, by a common fence. He, or his vendee, was personally liable for the tax, and it could not be charged on the ground.</p>
