      <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>This was an action of debt on the administration bond of M. B. Miltenberger and William Graham, jr., administrators of Joseph Oliver, deceased, in the penalty of $30,000, dated in 1833. This bond was taken by the register of Allegheny county, when letters of administration were granted by him to said administrators, and is in the usual and legal form. George Miltenberger and Samuel Johnston were the securities in said bond. M. B. Miltenberger, one of the administrators, died before the commencement of this suit. The plaintiff’s declaration is in the usual form of a <em>narr. </em>in debt on a bond with a penalty conditioned for the performance of other acts than the payment of money. The <em>narr. </em>after the usual commencement, sets forth the bond and its condition, and after averring that a large amount of assets, amounting to $3577.34, had come to the hands of said administrators, and that the same appeared by the account filed by William Graham, jr., surviving administrator, proceeds to set out the breach (after averment of sufficient assets.) Yet the said administrators did not nor would pay or cause to be paid unto the said John Sheriff, the amount of a certain debt due to him from the said administrators or administrator of said estate, by judgment rendered by M. B. Lowry,' alderman, in and for the city of Pittsburgh, on the <em>11th </em>of January, 1831, for the sum of fifty-six dollars and fifty-nine cents, with costs of suit, and the same to pay, (though often required so to do,) have hitherto wholly neglected and refused, and still neglect and refuse so to do. And the said plaintiff in fact, saith, that the said administrators have committed a devastavit in regard to the assets of the estate so come to their hands as aforesaid, and have wasted and misapplied the same. By reason of which said breach, the said writing obligatory became forfeited, and thereby an action hath accrued to the said plaintiff to demand and have, of and from the said defendants, the said penalty of $30,000 above demanded. Yet the said defendants have not, nor hath either of them, paid the said sum of money above demanded, or any part thereof, to the said plaintiff; and to pay the same hitherto have wholly refused, and still do refuse, to the damage of the said plaintiff of fifty dollars, and therefore the said plaintiffs bring suit, &amp;c.</p>

And the provisions of the statute must be followed. The judgment in this ease, in the particular in which it is complained of, is entirely in conformity with the statute: that is, for the Commonwealth in the amount of the obligation or bond; and secondly, for the plaintiff in the issue, (Sheriff,) in the amount of damages assessed by the jury. It is in vain to say that there ought to be a judgment for the debt found due to the plaintiff, and for the detention of that debt, inasmuch as it is an action of debt, because the statute enacts that the judgment for the <em>debt </em>sued for shall be in favor of the Commonwealth, that is, the amount of the bond; and secondly, for the plaintiff in such issue, that is, the person who is named on the record, as the individual for whose use the suit is instituted, <em>for the damages </em>assessed, and for the costs accrued between such plaintiff and the defendants. In Carman <em>v. </em>
      <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>Noble, 9 <em>Barr </em>372, it is said, that in such cases, according to tbe terms of the statute, there ought to be two judgments, one for the amount of the penalty of the bond, which would be cautionary, in favor of the Commonwealth, and the other for the plaintiff, as the <em>cestui que </em>use is denominated in the statute, for the amount of damage he should prove. In the same case it was ruled, that when the substantial elements of a valid judgment appeared on the record, this court would mould them into the form required by the statute. But this judgment might be supported under the English practice, under their statute, which regulated our practice, until our statutory regulations on the subject, superseded it. In England, at the trial, the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff, with fifteen shillings damages, and forty shillings costs, and also assessed the <em>damages </em>for the breaches; and then, on the return of the <em>postea, </em>the judgment is entered for the debt, which is the penalty of the bond, and one shilling damages, the latter being merely nominal; the real amount of the damages being that assessed by the jury, for the breaches assigned: 1 <em>Saunders </em>58, N. 1.</p>
    <p id="b75-5" data-blocks='[["BL_75.5",75,[141,1174,1183,299]]]'>The jury have found the breach assigned, and assessed damages for it. In that breach it is distinctly averred, that there was a debt due the plaintiff and unpaid, and which the administrator refused to pay; and the nature of the debt is distinctly set out. The jury also find in favor of the Commonwealth, for the penalty; the whole scope and intent of our statute is therefore fulfilled, in this particular.</p>
