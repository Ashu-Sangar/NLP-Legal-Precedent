It is now for the first time discovered that the judges of Pennsylvania, as well before as after the Revolution, were in error, and that the rights of the first builder must be disregarded, although the act of 1721 expressly enacts that the first builder shall be reimbursed. That the act oft 1849 is declaratory of the law, although the whole course of decision was uniform and to the contrary; that William Patten, the owner of the house for the time being, is entitled to the compensation for the party wall, and that the act arrests all proceedings in favor of first builders, commenced by them for their alleged interests in party walls.</p>

The act of 1849 was not passed when the judgment was entered; the judgment was right under the act of 1721. It is no ground to reverse because the legislature has chosen, as they had a right to do, to change the law on this subject. This court will not give a retrospective effect to statutes operating on a right, unless compelled to do so by direct and positive words, Lefever <em>v. </em>Witmer, 10 <em>Barr </em>505, and then the constitutionality of the statute will be considered.
