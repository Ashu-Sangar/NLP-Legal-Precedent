It appears from the evidence that the defendants are mere stakeholders, being the agents of the forwarding house of D. Leech &amp; Co. of this city, and have probably no interest in the questions on trial. The controversy arises between the plaintiffs, merchants, residing in Philadelphia, who sold the goods in question to Jesse Rhodes, of Massillon, Ohio, and certain New York creditors of the said J esse Rhodes, who have issued foreign attachments against him, and attached the goods in the hands of Hays and Black, summoning them as garnishees. The right of these respective claimants it will become our duty to determine.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b50-6" data-blocks='[["BL_50.5",50,[311,490,1176,559]]]'>In May, 1847, Jesse Rhodes sent his agent, Absalom Baker, to Philadelphia, to buy goods on Rhodes’ account. He did so, to the amount of some thousands of dollars, and gave them Jesse Rhodes’ note at six months for the amount of the invoice. The goods were packed and directed to Jesse Rhodes, Massillon, Ohio. Thus marked, the goods, according to the usual course of business in this respect, were collected at one store, or by one of the persons who had sold goods to the purchaser, and by them delivered to the transportation office to be forwarded to Pittsburgh. This service was performed by Atwood &amp; Co., no doubt under the direction of Mr. Baker, the agent of Rhodes. Atwood &amp; Co. then shipped the goods by D. Leech &amp; Co.’s line to Bagaley &amp; Smith, a forwarding and commission house in this city.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b50-7" data-blocks='[["BL_50.6",50,[309,1048,1179,512]]]'>After these goods had left Philadelphia, it appears that a portion of other purchases made by Baker, were attached at Philadelphia in the hands of J. Brown &amp; Co., by certain New York creditors of Rhodes, and it seems to have been apjwehended by some who had sold to Rhodes, that the residue of the’ goods would be attached in this city. Hence Ludwig, Kneedler &amp; Co. were about to send a member of their firm to arrest their .goods in Hollidaysburg. They agreed, however, with Baker, the agent, that he should go forward and stop the goods at that place, and not deliver them to Rhodes until he gave security for the amount of their bill; if he failed to do so, the goods were to be returned to them at Philadelphia.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b50-8" data-blocks='[["BL_50.7",50,[310,1562,1178,517]]]'>The plaintiffs were no parties to this arrangement. But Baker proceed to Hollidaysburg, and there (by order of the carriers, Harris and Leech, it is said on the manifest) stopped the goods, erased the marks upon the boxes of those now in question, and remarked them with a private mark without any direction; but on the boat’s manifest they were directed to be forwarded to the, care of S. A. Wheeler, Akron, Ohio, which, it appears, is on the usual route of canal transportation to Massillon and Uhricksville. The goods being so marked, arrived in Pittsburg, and were attached by Wood and Sheldon and other creditors of Rhodes, and were replevied by Mouille &amp; Co., the vendors. The question is, who shall hold the goods — the vendors or the attaching creditors ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b50-9" data-blocks='[["BL_50.8",50,[311,2078,1176,348]],["BL_51.1",51,[195,416,1183,345]]]'>The plaintiffs contend, that after the sale and shipment of these goods to Rhodes, and before he had received them, it was ascertained that he was insolvent, and that, consequently, they had a right to pursue and retake the goods at any time before they came to the actual or constructive possession of Rhodes, the vendee. When a vendor sells goods on credit to another, he has a right to resume the possession of the goods while they are in the hands of a carrier or middleman, in their transit to-the consignee, or ven<a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>dee, and before they arrive into his actual possession, or to the destination which he has appointed for them, on his becoming bankrupt or insolvent. This the law calls the right of stoppage <em>in transitu, </em>and it can only be exercised as between the vendor and vendee ; and, as the property is vested in the vendee by the contract of sale, it can only be revested in the vendor, during its transit to the vendee under the existence of the above circumstances: 2 <em>Kent’s Com. </em>540; <em>Story on Sales </em>257; <em>Smith’s Mercantile Law </em>547.</p>

It is not necessary, to prove insolvency, that he should have been declared a bankrupt or insolvent by a judicial tribunal, nor that he should have made an assignment of his property. If the fact exist, no matter how proved, if sufficiently and satisfactorily proved, the law requires no more: <em>Story on Sales </em>270. You have the testimony of Baker that Rhodes was indebted some $60,000, and that his assets were but $26,000, and that his creditors were watching for these goods on the line of transportation, and actually attached them before they reached Ohio, for debts which he was not able to pay — sufficient to satisfy you, I presume, of Rhodes’s entire insolvency.

It is not, however, every constructive delivery that will destroy the right in question. The delivery to a carrier or packer to and for the use of the vendee, or to a wharfinger, is a constructive delivery to the vendee, but it is not sufih cient to defeat the right, even though the carrier be appointed by the vendee: 2 <em>Kent’s Com. </em>545. It will continue until the place of delivery be in fact the end of the journey of the goods, and they have arrived to the possession or under the direction of the vendee himself. It is also settled that the transitus is at an end if the goods have arrived at an intermediate place, where they are to remain stationary under the orders of the vendee, and until by his directions they are again put in motion for some new and ulterior destination. They are, however, to be deemed in transitus so long as they remain in possession of the earner as such, even though such carrier may have been appointed by the consignee himself, and also while they are in any place of deposit connected with the transmission and delivery of them, and until they arrive at the actual or constructive possession of the consignee: <em>Smith’s Mercantile Law </em>552; <em>Story on Sales, </em>sec. 335, 336, 337.</p>

Chancellor Kent seems to be of opinion that a solvent for the difficulty may. be found in this rule: “ That if the delivery to a carrier or agent of the vendee be for the purpose of conveyance to the vendee, the right of stoppage continues, notwithstanding such a constructive delivery to the vendee; but if the goods be delivered to the carrier or agent, for safe custody, or for disposal on the part of the vendee, and the middleman is by assent converted into a special agent for the buyer, the transit or passage of the goods terminates, and with it the right of stoppage 2 <em>Kent’s Com. </em>545. The rule no doubt is entirely correct, with the exception of the case of goods delivered on board a ship belonging to or chartered by the vendee, which, in effect, is a delivery to the vendee himself: Bolin <em>v. </em>Huffnagle, <a href="/rawle/1/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Rawle 9" data-case-ids="1819364" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0009-01">1 <em>Rawle Rep. </em>9</a>.</p>

But the defendants contend “ that the delivery of the goods to Atwood <em>k </em>Co. upon the order of Baker, and their shipment by Atwood <em>k </em>Co. under his instructions, was such a delivery to the vendee as excludes any right of stoppage in transitu on the part of the vendor.” But for what purpose were the goods delivered to Atwood <em>k </em>Co. ? Was it for safe keeping or disposal? Certainly for neither. Then was it for transportation to the vendee ? The testimony shows that they merely collected them for transportation, and the fact that they were immediately transmitted on their way to Ohio, is satisfactory that they were delivered for no other purpose, that they were still in <em>transitu, </em>and that the right of stoppage was not at an end.</p>

But what authority had Baker to intercept the goods on Rhodes’ account at that place ? According to his own testimony he did it as the agent of certain creditors of Rhodes’s, and for their benefit, so that in fact it may have been an exercise of the right of stoppage <em>in transitu </em>by the vendors, though I do not perceive that he made much effort for the protection of those by whose orders the stoppage was made.</p>

And .in Whitehead <em>v. </em>Anderson, 9 <em>Meeson &amp; Welshy </em>534, Parke Baron observes: “ The law is clearly settled that the -unpaid vendor has a right to retake the goods before they have arrived at the destination originally contemplated by the purchaser, unless in the mean time they have come into the actual or constructive possession of the vendee. A case of constructive possession is where the carrier enters expressly or by implication into a new agreement distinct from the original contract for carriage, to hold the goods for the consignee as his agent, not for the purpose of expediting them to the place of original destination pursuant to that contract, but in a new character for the purpose of <em>custody </em>on his account, and subject to some new and further order to be given to him. It appears to us very doubtful whether the act of marking, or taking samples, or the like, without any removal from the possession of the carrier, as though with the intention of taking possession, would amount to a constructive possession, unless accompanied with such circumstances as to denote that the carrier was intended to keep, and assented to keep the goods in the cha-r racter of an agent for custody: "9 <em>M. &amp; </em>W.534. This case is cited with approval in Bonath <em>v. </em>Broomhead, I <em>Barr </em>304, by Judge Rogers. I see nothing, therefore, in the transaction, to put an end to the transitus at that point.</p>

Neither is it certain that if they had been delivered to Bagaley &amp; Smith, they were to be retained for further orders from the consignee or the person to whom directed. It is the duty of the forwarding house to expedite goods to their places of destination; and they would fail in that duty if. they did not, as soon as practicable, send them as directed, without delay for any further order than that found in their manifest, or the directions on the goods themselves.</p>
