Benner <em>v. </em>Phillips, 9 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>13; Murphy’s appeal, 8 <em>id. </em>165, and in many other cases. These cases settled another principle, as well as an important rule of practice, that a writ of <em>scire facias </em>may be issued upon a judgment against executors, in which proceeding a judgment may be entered against the heir or devisee, in accordance with the provisions of the act of 1834. By the 34th section of that act, the lien of debts of a decedent upon his real estate, is limited to five years, and under the provisions of this act, if suit he brought against the executor or administrator, within five years after the death of the decedent, and a <em>scire facias </em>to bring in the heirs or devisee be issued within five years from the rendition of the judgment in the original suit, the lien of the debt upon the real estate will be preserved.
