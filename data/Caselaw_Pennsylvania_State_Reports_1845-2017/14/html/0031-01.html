The court enumerates to the jury what are the undisputed facts, and directs them to find a special verdict on the disputed facts. The court say to the jury, <em>“ </em>It is therefore agreed that you shall find a special verdict on the disputed facts, and that the court shall enter such judgment thereon, and on the facts not disputed, as the law requires.” The paper book states that the jury returned negative answers to the two first points submitted to them, and then found specially, as to the disputed facts.</p>

There did exist another species of special verdict, as where the jury returned a general verdict for the plaintiff, subject, nevertheless, to the opinion of the court, on a special case, stated by the counsel, on both sides, on a matter 'of law: <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Black%20378" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Black 378">3 <em>Black. </em>378</a>. But this proceeding has gone <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>out of practice, perhaps never existed in Pennsylvania, and is nothing like the present ease. A special verdict is where the jury find the facts of the case, leaving the ultimate decision of the cause <em>upon those facts, </em>to the court, concluding conditionally, that if upon the whole matter thus found, the court should be of opinion that the plaintiff had a good cause of action, they then find for the plaintiff, and assess his damages; if otherwise, then for the defendant : <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Black%20378" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Black 378">3 <em>Black </em>378</a>; <em>Boote on Suit at Law, </em>158.

I apprehend there is no reported case, of any authority, where the court have gone beyond the facts found in the special verdict; for it is the province of the jury to judge of and find the facts, and the province of the court to declare the law on the facts so found. The undisputed facts ought to have been incorporated into the special verdict. :. And if they had omitted them by mistake, the court might upon motion and full evidence, have amended the special verdict: <em>Strange </em>514; <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20259" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="4 Watts 259">4 <em>Watts. </em>259</a>.
