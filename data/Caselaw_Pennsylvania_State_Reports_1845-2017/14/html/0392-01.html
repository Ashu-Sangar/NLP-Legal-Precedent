A main question submitted to the jury was, whether the sale and delivery had been so far completed prior to the attachment, as to divest the property in, or possession of the goods out of plaintiff, and to vest it in the purchasers, Clements &amp; Hall. This question was decided in the negative by the jury, who found for plaintiff 1146.52.</p>

Hopkins, a former clerk of plaintiff, who proved the sale by plaintiff to Clements &amp; Hall, through one professing to act as their agent, and the terms of sale, and he proved what portion of the goods so sold were seized by the sheriff. Hopkins likewise proved that a certain book produced before him was what was called the <em>“order, book” </em>of plaintiff, in which he or his clerks were in the habit of entering such goods as were from time to time ordered from him. This book was afterwards produced, and plaintiff offered to read the entries therein, <em>made by ITopJcins, </em>relative to the purchase of Clements &amp; Hall; to this, defendants objected, the objection was overruled, exceptions taken by defendant, and the book read.</p>

In this instance, the purpose was to prove, not a sale, but that there was, in the transaction, no more than an agreement to sell on a condition not performed, and the entries were offered to identify the subject of it, not the value. They were consequently before the court, not as book entries, which are competent to prove only a sale and delivery. They were imbodied in the testimony of a <em>witness who made them, </em>and verified them, as memoranda to designate the goods selected; and who testified that the ticks and marks placed opposite to the items were used to distinguish the casks or packages delivered to the drayman. The witness did not, as is usual in regard to book entries, authenticate the book and leave it to speak for itself; he testified to the particulars of the transaction from his own knowledge; and, thus corroborated, the entries were clearly admissible.</p>
