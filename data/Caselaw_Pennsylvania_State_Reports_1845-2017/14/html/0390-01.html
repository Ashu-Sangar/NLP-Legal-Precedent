      <em>. </em>A judgment was entered in the District Court in the name of Joseph Clegg against Philip Banks. Judgment entered, September 24, 1889, on bond and warrant of attorney. May 8, 1841, this judgment marked to the use of Francis Blackburne. July 20, 1843, this judgment marked to the use of John Taylor, junior.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b390-10" data-blocks='[["BL_390.9",390,[337,1243,1186,949]]]'>In February, 1845, the case was on trial, before Stroud, J., and after defendant’s evidence under the plea of payment had been concluded, Mr. Fallon, plaintiff’s attorney, was offered on the part of plaintiff to prove admissions by Blackburne and Taylor, at the time the judgment was marked to the use of Taylor, that Blackburne was merely the agent of Taylor in the transaction. Objected to, because the declarations or conversation took place in the absence of the defendant. The evidence was admitted, and exception on the part of defendant. Mr. Fallon testified that he never was counsel for Clegg. In July, 1843, either on the day the judgment was marked to Taylor’s use, or a little before, Blackburne and Taylor were at his office. No consideration for the assignment was paid, and both informed him that the judgment had been transferred to Blackburne, merely as Taylor’s agent. After this testimony was given, Blackburne, the assignee of the judgment, was offered to rebut the defendant’s proof of payment, and to show that <em>Taylor </em>was from the first known to Banks as the owner and purchaser of the judgment, and that it was transferred by Clegg after notice to defendant, who represented it as wholly due. His admission was objected to on the ground that he was a plaintiff in the <em>scire </em>facias, and that he had an <em>apparent </em>interest in the case, which could not be removed by his own testimony.</p>
