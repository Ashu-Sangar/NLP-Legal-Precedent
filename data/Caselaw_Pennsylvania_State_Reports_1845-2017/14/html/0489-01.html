All that relates to the actions of the parties subsequent to the execution of the deed of trust, has nothing in it that bears on the integrity of that transaction, except that Mrs. Greenfield habitually spoke of the instrument as her will; whence an argument that she was deceived in supposing that she was executing an ordinary will, and not an irrevocable instrument. But though she spoke of it as a will, she spoke of it as an irrevocable one; and, almost to the last, exulted in the belief that it was so. She knew she had made a posthumous disposition of her estate, and it was natural for a person ignorant of technical terms, to designate it as she did. Even Rush, a trustee, and privy to the whole transaction, called it her will. As to its being, in fact, a testamentary act, and therefore revocable, the argument is scarce worth an answer. ’Tis true, a deed containing a posthumous disposition has been proved as a will; but here the trust was not entirely posthumous, for the legal title Avas vested in the trustees, in order to let them manage the property in her lifetime, and to pay as much of the produce as she should desire into her hands. There was nothing testamentary in that. But according to all the proofs, the very object of resorting to a trust deed, was to make the disposition unalterable; and, if the OAvner of property cannot tie up his hands in regard to it by such an instrument, he cannot do it at all.</p>

It is charged that neither was read to her, nor the contents made known to her, prior to, and at the time of the execution of them, nor ever after, till the time of her decease; and it is said, that the charge is corroborated by the confidential relation in which one of the trustees stood to her, in connection with the exorbitant compensation reserved, and the provision for exempting the trustees from responsibility for their agents, or for each other. As compensation merely, the sum of $40,000 for managing an estate worth only five times as much, Avould be inordinate; but if she thought proper to give a princely recompense to those who served her, there could be no indelicacy in accepting it. Not a drop of her blood ran in the veins of any living creature; for the allegation of her consanguinity to the Reeses, and supposed attachment to them, has been entirely disproved, if any thing can be disproved. Indeed, it seems to have been their importunities principally, against which she sought protection. Now all the depositions show that she was generous to a fault; indeed, she seemed to have a passion for giving; and she might well give munificently to those who helped her to accomplish the closing object of her life, a settlement of her property, which would secure her from imp sition in her second childhood, and prevent litigation <a id="p496" href="#p496" data-label="496" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*496</a>about her property after her death, of which she spoke with fear and apprehension. Nor was this trust thought, by others a thing to be coveted. Mr. Cowperthwait deposed that both he and Dr. Hulings declined it. But the amount of compensation was suggested by Mr. Rush, the colluding trustee; and it is clear that he, the husband of a member of the Rees family, and the father of another, did not think it too great. As to the disqualification of a lawyer to act in a trust about which he has been consulted professionally, I know nothing of it. His confidential relation can, at most, give cause of suspicion, which may be removed.</p>

Unfortunately, Mr. Justice Baldwin and Alderman Pettit, the only two disinterested persons present, have passed away; but they have stamped the transaction with the impress of their high character. Foul play in the presence of Judge Baldwin could not have been successfully practiced, nor can it be successfully imputed; and we accordingly find that the bill does not directly charge either fraud, imposition, or misrepresentation. I am far from clear that it might not have been demurred to. If a party who can read, as Mrs. Greenfield could, will not read a deed put before him for execution; or if, being unable to read, will not demand to have it read or explained to him, he is guilty of supine negligence, which, I take it, is not the subject of protection, either in equity or at law. At law, it certainly is not. “If the party that is to seal the deed, can read himself and doth not, or being illiterate or blind, doth not require to hear the deed read, or the contents thereof declared, in these cases, albeit the deed is contrary to his mind, yet it is good and unavoidable.” <em>Touch. 56. </em>But, adds Mr. Preston, the editor, “Equity may correct mistakes, frauds,” &amp;c. For this he refers to Manser’s case, 2 <em>Co. </em>3 b, in a note to which there is a reference to Bennet <em>v. </em>Vade, 2 <em>Atk. </em>324, which was the case, however, of a conveyance by a man on the verge of insanity, who had even been married at the instigation pf others, without proposal made to him, or without being conscious that he was so; who had been cautioned by a friend not to sign papers; and who stood so much in awe of the grantee, that the bare name of the latter would reduce him to submission when he was furious. That was a case of undue influence. The principle of Mr. Preston is asserted also by Mr. Thomas, in a note to Thoroughgood’s case, 2 <em>Co. </em>9 b, for which he refers to Jones <em>v. </em>Crawley, <em>Pinch’s Rep. </em>161, which was a case of positive misrepresentation; and to the Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Sothon, 2 <em>Vern. </em>497, which was a case of compulsion; neither of which sustain the principle for which they were quoted; and the <em>dicta </em>of these respectable editors have to encounter authorities which bear the other way, without the benefit of adventitious aid. In an anonymous case in <em>Skin. </em>159, one who could read, made an <a id="p497" href="#p497" data-label="497" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*497</a>agreement for a lease for twenty-one years; the lessor cjrew a lease for one year, but read it twenty-one; and equity refused to relieve the lessee, because he could read and would not; and in this it certainly carried the principle of non-intervention a great way. But in Willes <em>v. </em>Jernegan, 2 <em>Atk. </em>251, equity refused to relieve against a hard bargain made by a man with his eyes open, because there was no fraud. Nor will a party be relieved merely because he put an unguarded confidence in another: Langley <em>v. </em>Brown, <em>id. </em>202. Now, if Mrs. Greenfield neither called for the deeds, nor inquired what the trustees were to have, she left them to make their own terms, and she was bound by it. Such a thing as fraud, imposture, or deceit, by them, is neither charged nor proved. The complainant relies exclusively on the abstract effect of the fact— if it be a fact — that the deeds were not read to the grantor at the time of execution, or the contents made known to her at any time before; yet as she could read and did not, my opinion is that the complainant be not relieved on that ground, without -superadded proof of management and surprise.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b497-5" data-blocks='[["BL_497.5",497,[164,1169,1192,1255]],["BL_498.1",498,[293,490,1195,679]]]'>Of all the persons present at the act of execution, John Bouvier, Joseph Howell, and Samuel W. Rush, alone survive, and can speak of what took place. Mary Richards, it is true, deposed that Mrs. Greenfield told her Judge Baldwin had read the deeds to her; but she was evidently mistaken, for the respondents do not allege in their answer that they were read then. Mr. Bouvier says they were produced by her, and their nature was explained to her by Judge Baldwin. Mr. Howell says that, being asked if she knew their contents, she replied that she knew all about them; but both say they had been in her possession for several days for examination. Mr. Howell further says that the clause for compensation was suggested, as he believes, not by the trustees, but by her. That she did not consider that she had been overreached in regard to it, is evident from the fact proved by the complainant himself, that she had subsequently made a voluntary offer of a sealed note to Mr. Bouvier of $5000 in addition. It will not do to say that this note may have been procured by an abuse of confidence, for Mr. Bouvier is too good a lawyer not to know that it was altogether worthless, as it could not prevail against the declaration of trust. Now, these answers of the trustees, though not evidence of any fact in favor of themselves, are nevertheless sufficient to rebut the-whole charge in the plaintiffs bill, and to leave the proofs to stand on the depositions and exhibits. We have the affirmation of two-of the surviving trustees against that of the complainant, which would be enough to satisfy even the Roman law. I say nothing-of the answer of Mr. Rush, whose position in the cause is too equivocal to let his admissions be evidence against his co-trustees, even did not the general rule prevent it. But giving the complainant the benefit of his affirmation, the proofs on the pleadings <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>would stand in equilibrio; and how do they stand on the testimony of witnesses ? In vain do we look into it for a syllable on the subject, except the statements of Mary Richards already noted; and we are to presume foul play in the absence of proof of it! Long experience in these matters teaches me that a deed is very seldom read over to the grantor in the presence of the magistrate in attendance; nor is it usual to communicate the substance of it to the grantor, except in making the separate examination of a married woman. That is presumed to have been done before. Had 'the trustees insisted on having these deeds read to Mrs. Greenfield, deaf as an adder, I would have applied to them the spirit of Lord Mansfield’s remark, that he had never known a forged will which did not purport to have been executed according to the strictest requirements of the statute of frauds. The presumption of innocence in this case, casts the <em>onus </em>of proof on the complainant, and he has failed to sustain it.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b498-6" data-blocks='[["BL_498.4",498,[299,1178,1186,1204]]]'>But he insists that he is entitled to the profits of the estate and an account. I think it clear that he is not. In the declaration of trust, the respondents say “ we will apply the income and profits thereof as the said Elizabeth shall direct; and for want of such direction, that we will invest the profits, after deducting all expenses, in some stock, or lend the same upon security; and that such sums shall be considered as under the same situation, and for the same trusts, as the property conveyed to us as aforesaid, and after the death of the said Elizabeth Greenfield, for the uses and purposes following, to wit,” and they are then set down. She reserved a right to spend the whole of the profits in her lifetime; not to direct the application of them by will, an exercise of power on her part, she was anxious above all things to preclude. Had they continued to swell, as they did till they reached the amount of fourteen thousand dollars in the year immediately preceding the loss of half the estate in <em>the </em>stocks of the Mississippi banks, she would have had as much to bequeath, on the principle of'the argument, as half of the original amount of the estate, and have been exposed to the importunities and impositions she so much dreaded. When the settlement was executed, she frequently spoke of it in a tone almost of exultation, that she was done with such dispositions for ever. But the trusts were to take up whatever was unexpended at her death; indeed it would seem that each annual surplus was to be invested as trust money in her lifetime. The complainant, therefore, is not entitled to either the profits or an account, in his character of administrator with the will annexed; and, if that were otherwise, the Common Pleas had acquired jurisdiction of <em>the </em>account at the filing of the bill.</p>

At the time of its inception, Mrs. Greenfield was of ample fortune, very far beyond any amount of debt for which she was liable. Indeed, there appears to have existed, at that time, but a single debt, and for this provision was made. Those averred to have been since created, cannot be invoked in aid of this attempt to invalidate the arrangement, for a voluntary settlement of an estate, made by one unindebted at the time, or who reserves sufficient to pay all existing debts, cannot be successfully attacked by subsequent creditors, unless, indeed, there be something to show the settlement was made in anticipation of future indebtedness. I know some doubt was thrown upon the soundness of this principle by Thomson <em>v. </em>Dougherty, 12 <em>Ser. &amp; R. 448; </em>but it was afterwards dissipated in Mateer <em>v. </em>Hassin, <a href="/pr/3/0160-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 P.R. 160" data-case-ids="11258292" data-case-paths="/pr/3/0160-01">3 <em>P.R. </em>160</a>, supported by a multitude of cases cited for the defendants on the argument.</p>
    <p id="b502-7" data-blocks='[["BL_502.5",502,[304,1321,1188,1162]]]'>Neither is there the slightest pretence for saying the settlement must be accepted as a testamentary disposition, or that the donor was unduly induced to give it effect under the erroneous idea that it was a last will, or something in the nature of one. That it is not so, in fact, is abundantly shown by the reasons given at <em>Nisi Prius, </em>in corroboration of which, numerous authorities might be adduced. It may, however, suffice to refer to Thompson <em>v. </em>Brown, 3 <em>Mill &amp; Keen </em>32; and the concurring American cases of Hester <em>v. </em>Young, 2 <em>Kelly (Geo.) Rep. </em>31-46; Jackson v.Culpeper, 3 <em>Kelly </em>569-573-574; Cumming <em>v. </em>Cumming, <em>ib. </em>460-484; and Allison <em>v. </em>Kurtz, 4 <em>Kawkes </em>141-171. These settle the difference to be not in the form but effect of the instrument used, which, if it convey an estate <em>in presentí, </em>cannot be a will, for that operates only <em>in futuro. </em>The subject is well discussed by Mr. Jarmin, in his treatise on wills, where it is shown the true principle is that ascertained by Thompson <em>v. </em>Brown. That case, in the particular under consideration, is identical with the present. As was well observed at the bar, the instruments here in question, purport, first, to be made <em>inter vivos, </em>and to take effect immediately; second, that they did take effect immediately, by the delivery of the deeds and the transfer of the whole estate; third, that provision was made in them for the action of the trustees during the life of Mrs. Greenfield ; fourth, that those provisions were executed for ten years ; and, fifth, that the instruments were complete, and calculated for instant operation. All of these features are utterly inconsistent with the aspect of a purely testamentary disposition, and therefore disprove the deeds in question, as belonging to that class.</p>

The proof is, she was acquainted with the nature of testamentary dispositions, having executed at least two wills before that time; that she became dissatisfied with the liability to solicitation and the consequent annoyance to which the revocable nature of these exposed her; that to escape from this, and by way of protection even against herself, she desired to make an irrevocable arrangement of her affairs, and that, with this view, she perfected the disposition of which she after-wards spoke as unchangeable by any mere exertion of her desire. It is true, that she sometimes referred to it as her “will.” But as it was to be chiefly operative after her death, it is not at all surprising one unacquainted with the strict import of the term, should occasionally misapply it, when referring to documents which dealt largely in posthumous gifts. Yet, certain it is, that she frequently alluded to it, as being unalterable “ as the laws of the Medes and Persians,” and seemed to exult in that fact, as her protection against imposition and obtrusive importunity. It is also true, that after the conversation with Charles Roberts, in which he reproached her with extravagant expenditure, she seems occasionally to have entertained a desire to revoke the prior arrangement, and to <em>resume </em>the <em>full </em>dominion of her property. But there is evidence that these expressions of impatience were made during moments of excitement, probably induced by the remarks of interested persons calling into question the action of the trustees, and thus prompting an enfeebled intellect to a suspicion that those in whom she had trusted were exerting an improper exercise of the power vested in them. Yet, even in her conferences with Mr. Gilpin relative to the testamentary paper afterwards executed, she recognized the then distasteful fact that she had relinquished the command of her property, by the expression of her dissatisfaction with the existing condition of her affairs, and of her desire to resume the absolute control of them, with a view to a new disposition. This, while it certainly indicates present discontent, seems tcf point unerringly to prior knowledge of the nature of the disposition already made. Indeed, without wading through it in detail, I may indicate the tendency of the mass of the testimony on this point, by saying that, in my apprehension, it establishes both Mrs. Greenfield’s intention to make a final disposition of her estate, and her knowledge that she had done so. Whether her subsequent discontent was created by the practices at which I have hinted, or was the result of spontaneous repentance, it is almost needless to remark, it was impotent to destroy the trusts she had created, even though her desire to do so was manifested by her execution of the testamentary paper prepared by Mr. Gilpin.</p>

The general rule is, that a party executing a legal instrument is presumed to be acquainted with its contents. Where it is of ordinary import, unconnected with suspicious circumstances, and uninfluenced, actually or presumptively, by the peculiar relation subsisting between the maker of it and the party to be benefited by it, the burden of disproving the presumption lies on him who would impeach the deed. Nay, the authorities show that, usually, if one who is about to execute an instrument can read it, and neglects to do so; or being blind or illiterate, chooses to act without requiring the contents to be made known to him, he will be bound to it, though it turn out to be contrary to his mind: <em>Touch. </em>56 ; Hollenbeck v. Dewitt, 2 <em>John. R. </em>404; King <em>v. </em>Longnor, 1 <em>Nev. &amp; Man. </em>576. Doubtless, a fraud, actively practised upon a party so situated, would vitiate his act, and it has been made a question whether, in an ordinary case, equity would correct a mistake in a deed so executed ? If so, most certainly a chancellor would not interfere except upon distinct and convincing proof of the alleged mistake, by him who averred it. So far as the general disposition of this estate is involved, I perceive nothing to withdraw it from the operation of the ordinary rule I have stated. In this aspect, it presents an instance of one who, possessed of wealth but destitute of relatives, was desirous to provide for the future disposition of her estate among those whom, during a long and active life, she had regarded as friends. So far as appears, this was effected without the slightest improper interference by them, or any thing to induce the most remote suspicion of undue influence or unfair practice. No whisper of it has been heard in the proofs. Indeed, so far as the general beneficiaries are concerned, the deeds are unassailed upon this ground. Nor- is there any room for the suggestion of incompetency from imbecility of intellect. The evidence shows she was capable of comprehending the contemplated distribution of her estate, and the piljsumption is she did understand it, at least to the extent of the dispositions in favor of persons not parties to the deeds.</p>

In this instance, he acted upon the express suggestion <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>and recommendation of Mr. Howell, in whom the donor reposed the most implicit faith. It is evident, both these gentlemen exercised over her an almost unbounded influence, and were thus enabled to give direction to her thoughts and actions. Mr. Rush also stood towards her in a fiduciary relation; and the fourth trustee, Mr. Roberts, was brought into the business by Mr. Howell, under a recommendation well calculated to command her utmost trust. For a considerable time before the conveyance, it is proved she was improvident, if not extravagant, in the expenditure of her fortune, and, in reference to it, singularly open to solicitation and importunity. In the language used at <em>Nisi JPrius, </em>she was generous to a fault, and seems to have been haunted by a passion for giving. While indulging this inclination for expenditure, the deeds in question were made. By these is reserved to the trustees the sum of $40,000, being $10,000 to each, professedly as compensation for assuming the burden of a trust which might have been terminated in a year; and, according to every probability, would not endure for a very long period. As a reward for the future management of an estate worth, at the utmost, only five times as much, the sum named has been well designated as inordinate. Yet this fact will by no means justify a charge of actual fraud against the parties who principally managed this transaction. As already intimated, there is no proof in the cause to warrant so grave an accusation, especially of individuals enjoying the eminent reputation which all accord to these trustees. I can very well imagine how, without a violation of conscience, they might conceive themselves entitled to a princely remuneration, under the circumstances then surrounding the donor. But in spite of this concession, a rule of public policy and ]5ure morals, founded in long experience of the humati heart and knowledge of man’s cupidity, interposes to forbid an allowance of the claim. In this feature, the case presents what is called a constructive fraud, springing from the confidential relations existing between the parties. This peculiarity, withdrawing it from the operation of ordinary rules, throws upon the beneficiaries the duty of showing expressly that the arragement was fair and conscientious, beyond the reach of suspicion. In requiring this, courts of equity act irrespective of any admixture of deceit, imposition, overreaching, or other positive fraud. As it has often been said, the principle stands independently of such elements of active mischief. It' is founded upon a motive of general policy, and is designed to protect a party, so far as may be, against his own overweening confidence and self-delusion, the infirmities of a hasty judgment, and even the impulses of a too sanguine temperament. It has been beneficially applied to those confidences which owe their birth to the relation of parent and child, guardian and ward, trustee and <em>cestui que trust, </em>and, above all, attorney and client. To guard against the strong influences which these connections are <a id="p506" href="#p506" data-label="506" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*506</a>so apt to originate, the law not only watches over the transactions of the parties with great and jealous scrutiny, but it often declares transactions absolutely void, which, between other parties, would be open to no exception. This is emphatically true of the relation of client and attorney, and to persons standing in a situation as <em>quasi </em>guardians or confidential advisers. Many of the cases establish the doctrine that, while these connections exist in full vigor, the adviser shall take no benefit to himself, from contracts or other negotiations with the advised: (Hatch <em>v. </em>Hatch, 9 <em>Vesey </em>297; Wood <em>v. </em>Downes, 18 <em>Vesey </em>126; De Montmorency <em>v. </em>Devereux, 7 <em>Clark &amp; Finelly </em>188:) a doctrine intended to supersede the necessity of any inquiry into the means used or the exertion of influence in any particular case, which is often difficult, if not impossible from the very nature of things: Welles <em>v. </em>Middleton, 1 <em>Cox R. </em>125; Wright <em>v. </em>Proud, 13 <em>Vesey </em>137. Other authorities, where the transaction is one of contract and sale, conceding that it may not be absolutely void <em>ipso facto, </em>throw upon the agent the burden of establishing its perfect fairness and adequacy, and that it was the deliberate act of the confiding party, after being fully informed of his rights, interests, and duties, and put upon his guard against even the suggestions of his own inclinations. It must appear affirmatively that no advantage has been taken of the client; and if this be not absolutely established <em>uberrima fide, </em>equity will treat the case as one of constructive fraud. An attorney, or other confidential adviser, is not permitted to avail himself either of the necessities of his client, or of his good nature, liberality, or credulity, to obtain undue advantages, bargains, or gratuities; and it has been said, there would be no bounds to the crushing influence of the power of an attorney who has the affairs of a man in his hand, if it were not so: Gibson <em>v. </em>Joyes, 6 <em>Vesey </em>278; Montesquieu <em>v. </em>Sandys, 18 <em>Vesey </em>313; Jones <em>v. </em>Thomas, 3 Y. &amp; <em>Coll. </em>498. A judicious writer on this subject has observed, that equity “ does not so much consider <em>the </em>bearing and hardship of this doctrine upon particular cases, as it does the importance of preventing a general public mischief, which may be brought about by means secret and inaccessible to judicial scrutiny, from the dangerous influence arising from the confidential relations of the parties.” 1 <em>Story’s Eq., </em>sec. 311.</p>

In Wright <em>v. </em>Proud, Lord Eldon said, an attorney shall not take a gift from his client while the relation subsists, though the transaction may be not only free from fraud, but the most moral in its nature; a <em>dictum </em>which Lord Brougham observed was afterwards reduced, in Hatch <em>v. </em>Hatch, to this, that it is almost impossible for a gift from client to attorney to stand, because the difficulty is extreme of showing that every thing was voluntary and fair, and with full warning and perfect knowledge: <a id="p507" href="#p507" data-label="507" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*507</a>Hunter <em>v. </em>Aikens, 8 <em>M. &amp; Keen </em>113; and see Edwards <em>v. </em>Meyrick, 2 <em>Hare R. </em>60-68.</p>

Under its operation it is impossible the declaration in favor of the trustees should stand. At the date of the transaction the creator of the trust was a very old woman, in a great measure dependent for advice and direction in her pecuniary affairs upon those in whom she placed her confidence. Unacquainted with legal forms and unused to the transaction of legal business, it is highly improbable she could have made herself acquainted, without assistance, with the long, dry, and tedious details of the two deeds, though they might have been left with her for several days, as the answers aver. No one of those who constantly surrounded her ever saw her perusing them, or in any way attempting to master the contents; and there is no shadow of independent proof that any one offered to assist her in this irksome task. To be sure, two of the answers allege, in substance, that the deeds wmre read to her by Mr. Bouvier, and that at the time of their execution, either Judge Baldwin or Alderman Pettit explained to her the nature of them. On the other hand, Mr. Rush, in his answer, positively avers the papers were neither read nor explained to her; Judge Baldwin having expressly declined to do so. But were we, after a general replication, at liberty to accept the two first answers as proof, they do not go far enough. I think it may be said, without hazard of error, that to uphold such a claim as is made here, by these trustees, it is not enough to show, generally, that the instruments were read to the party, or to aver broadly that the contents were explained to her, or that she admitted her knowledge of them. Under the wholesome rules I have brought to view, at the very least it ought to be proved the attention of the party was called to the very provision, with full and candid explanations of its character and effect; and that, after taking it into her “fair, serious, and well informed consideration,” she assented to it uninfluenced by those who are to be benefited by it. In saying this, I have borrowed the idea of Lord Eldon, and quoted some of his language in Hatch <em>v. </em>Hatch, when speaking of a gratuity, by way of remuneration, offered by an emancipated ward to his late guardian, for the care and labor exerted in the management of his estate; and he added: “ But the court cannot permit it, except quite satisfied that the act is of that nature, for the reason often given; and recollecting that in discussing whether it is an act of rational consideration, an act of pure volition uninfluenced, that inquiry is so easily baffled in a court of justice; that instead of the spontaneous act of a friend uninfluenced, it may be the impulse of a mind misled by undue kindness, or forced by oppression, &amp;c. And, therefore, if the court does not watch these transactions with a jealousy almost invincible, in a great majority of instances <a id="p508" href="#p508" data-label="508" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*508</a>it will lend its assistance to fraud.” These remarks are full to our purpose. Looking to the whole case, as it is presented by both proofs and pleadings, the questions may be asked, was Mrs. Greenfield aware that by the terms of the declaration, her estate was to be burdened with the payment of $40,000 as compensation to the trustees ? Did she know that this sum was payable though each of the trustees might decline the burden of the trust within a year after its creation ? She might have been acquainted with the first provision without being cognizant of the last, for they are widely separated in the deed. Who shall say it was not so ? And yet to sustain them, I repeat it must be clearly established she not only knew of, but comprehended both, thoroughly. The answers, at most, aver that she suggested the amount of compensation hex’self; but was she made aware of the clause under which it might be reduced to a mere gift ? It is extremely difficult to believe she understood and deliberately assented to this. The doubt is sufficient to invalidate the provision. It was said, on the argument, that all the cases in which donations and gratuities were disallowed, are either cases where no service was rendered, or of past services, which, it is thought, differ in pi’inciple from those where the services are prospective. I am not aware of any instance in which this distinction is taken. But, as in our case, the declension of all service and responsibility was optional with the trustees, I am disposed to regard the sums dedicated to them rather in the light of a gift than as payment, and to submit it to the rigidity of inquisition to which such gifts are always exposed. Under such a scx’utiny, it must necessarily fail. The trustees acting ixx this matter through Bouvier, as their representative, who himself was the attorney of the donor, they all stand in the categox*y of confidential advisers who have attempted to secure a benefit to themselves, through the influence appertaining to their confidential positions. It is impossible to discrimiixate between them. Each is so intimately dependent on the others, that the fall of one necessarily drags down all.</p>

But Morse <em>v. </em>Royal, 12 <em>Vesey </em>373, shows that in these cases, an asserted confix’mation is regarded with the same spirit of jealousy as attaches upon the original transactioxx, and that it is required to stand upon the clearest evidence. Of confirmation, in the particular under coxxsideration, we have not the slightest testimony. Indeed, it is not asserted the old lady ever saw the papers after they were executed.</p>

As we have seen, very different considerations are applicable to these several interests, and the rights flowing from them are to be measured by very different rules. Each may stand without the other, and thus the declaration of trust may be established in respect of those dispositions not obnoxious to an avoiding principle, while those entitled to a less favorable construction may be declared void. This power of discrimination is entirely within the province of a court of equity, where.a trust is divisible into distinct parts. In the exercise of a sound discretion, regarding distinct individuals as independent parties, it may uphold all of a transaction free of the taint of fraud, actual or constructive, while it decrees the destruction of those portions of it open to such an impeachment.</p>
