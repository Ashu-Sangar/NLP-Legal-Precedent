Elfelt, one of the plaintiffs, being under examination, said, in relation to a note on J. &amp; Gr. C.

It has not been paid since. I think this note was received by the firm in June, 1841.

The court overruled the objection, and plaintiffs’ counsel excepted. The witness said: If this note is credited, I have no recollection of it.

Direct personal notice is not pretended; it is notice by mail that is alleged. Notice of this kind should appear with some degree of certainty in the proof of it. We should be informed positively where the notice was sent to, and when it was sent. Evidence of the deposit of a written notice in some post-office, to some other unascertained post-office, say the Supreme Court, 7 <em>Barr </em>438, is too loose and unsatisfactory to satisfy the rule, which requires great certainty and dis-. tinctness of proof, to charge an endorser on the foot of a post-office notice. Where was the notice in this case sent ? There is nothing in the case to satisfy us as to that. Now, if the plaintiffs fail in either of these particulars — proof of demand or of notice — your verdict must be for the defendants. If you are satisfied that the proof establishes notice and demand, you will then consider how much the plaintiffs are entitled to recover.</p>

This was the single ground upon which <em>the </em>ease was made to rest at the second trial. In treating <em>it, </em>the court below, as it appears to us, very fairly instructed the jury in accordance with the prior adjudication here. The duties of demand and notice incumbent on the plaintiffs were clearly pointed out, and the evidence tending to show performance or the contrary was properly referred to the jury. It is true, this reference was attended by instructions on the subject of the certainty and distinctness of the required proof, and an expressed opinion of the value of the proof given by the plaintiff. But those instructions are in entire harmony with ascertained rules, as is proved by the cases cited on the argument, and it would not be difficult to show the opinion expressed is fully justified by the character of the evidence reviewed. Indeed, upon this head, less was said in disparagement of the plaintiff’s ¡jase than its defects would seem to warrant. It appears to me, that without at all jeoparding the truth, the jury might have been told there was not sufficient evidence of demand and notice of non-payment. Were this, however, otherwise, it would furnish no cause for reversing the judgment, since no attempt was made to impose on the jury the impressions of the judge, as a binding direction. In this respect they were left free in the exercise of their judgments, under the repeated assurance that to them alone appertained the decision of the disputed facts. We perceive no error in the charge.</p>

It is therefore powerless to create an interest in the subject of the action, which did not exist before, or to impose a liability which the law did not then recognise. Nor did the legislature intend otherwise. By its very terms, the statute was to operate prospectively. No retroactive force was conferred upon it, nor any attempt made to confer it. Collecting its character from its language, we find it to be accordant, in this particular, with the dictates of sound policy and abstract justice.</p>

The answer returned by the witness to the first question objected -against, worked no injury. It is simply, that he had no recollection on the subject. Besides, the court, in its charge, gave to the plaintiffs the benefit of their averment that the note had been accepted conditionally. Upon this concession the cause was tried, and, therefore, no inconvenience was inflicted by the question complained of.</p>
