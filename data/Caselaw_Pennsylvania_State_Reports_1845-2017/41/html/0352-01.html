    <p class="summary" id="b355-9" data-blocks='[["BL_355.9",355,[147,936,1177,1246]]]'>Sometime in 1835 or 1836, the defendant, Abdin Abbott, and his brothers Ananias and John, entered into articles of agreement with the executors of Daniel Perkins, for the purchase of two hundred acres of land at two dollars and a half per acre. Immediately afterwards, they divided the land into three equal parts, and each one took possession of one of these parts as his share of the purchase. In November 1858, while each one was in actual possession of his part, Cornelius Hall, under whom the plaintiff claims, purchased from Ananias five acres off the piece in his possession. Abdin Abbott, the defendant, was present at the execution of the contract between Ananias and Hall, witnessed it, heard it read, and, immediately upon its execution, assisted in measuring off the five acres to Hall, who paid the purchase-money, took actual possession of the land, cleared it, built a blacksmith shop and log-house on it. The contract between Ananias and Hall provides for a deed when one is obtained from the executors of Perkins. Nothing was said by Ananias and Abdin as to the nature of the agreement with Perkins’s executors, which was, that no title could be had till the two hundred acres were paid for. Ananias failed to pay for his share. The parties having failed to pay the purchase-money, ejectment was brought in 1845 by Perkins’s executors, when the contract was surrendered. Afterwards, a new contract was made, and in 1853 the executors conveyed the land to Abdin and John Abbott, and A. G-. Munsor. Ananias never paid any portion of the purchase-money. It was not alleged or denied, that Abdin had bought from Ananias his interest in the contract with Perkins’s executors ; but he permitted Ananias to have possession of a part, embracing the five acres in dispute.</p>

Ejectment is substituted for a bill in equity, and one judgment on an equitable title was held conclusive in Seitzinger <em>v. </em>Ridgeway, <a href="/watts/9/0496-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 Watts 496" data-case-ids="1850034" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0496-01">9 Watts 496</a>, although not coupled with any conditions.

And in a suit against Abdin Abbott, who was no party to the agreement, and who is sought to be reached only by reason of representations which estop him from setting up his own title against that which Hall bought from Ananias, there is no decree in equity needed. Hall, or his vendee, has title enough to try that question, under our law, without any conditional verdict. If Hall had a complete title, lacking only the conveyance, and Abdin Abbott has done anything that estops him from setting up his after-acquired title against it, Hall’s vendee may recover against him, though his claim has already been tried and defeated in one action of ejectment.</p>
