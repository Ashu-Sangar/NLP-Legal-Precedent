If it can be shown that the notice, if written, was actually received by the endorser in due time, then there is no difficulty; but if you cannot, then certain rules have been established which, if complied with, are considered as equivalent to notice, although the notice may never have reached the endorser, and he may have been entirely ignorant of the dishonour of the paper.

Second, by proof that the notice actually came to hand in proper time, though the letter containing the notice was not properly directed or sent by the most expeditious or direct route. The fact of notice and its reception in due time are the only matters material to the drawer or endorser of a dishonoured bill; the manner or place in which he received such notice is immaterial, for all the objects to be answered by its reception it is equally available to them. To the holder it is immaterial whether the evidence of notice consists in the legal presumption arising from due diligence which supplies the place of specific evidence, and is binding on a jury as proof of its reception, or it is established by direct evidence or such circumstances as will in law justify them in drawing the inference: <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pet.%20132" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Pet. 132">2 Peters 132</a>.”</p>

The first bill states the reading in evidence by the plaintiffs of the note and protest, and gives the testimony of William Brewster, a clerk of the defendants, who proved the insolvency of the maker, and that he had no funds in the hands of the defendants at the maturity of the note, which was payable at their office— that he placed the note in the hands of a notary for protest on Saturday, 25th August 1855, between ten and eleven o’clock at night, having been there before; the notary demanded the note of the witness at his office, and he told him there were no funds. Witness then said: “ He (the notary) made out the protest and notice, and he and I went to E. J. Kelso’s dwelling-house. The house was closed, the lights out, and the family retired. I rang the door-bell; a lady put her head out of the chamber window and asked what was wanted ? I asked if Mr. Kelso was at home; I said I had a note for him, and it was important that he should get it that night. She directed me to put it under the door; I did so, and Mr. Brown, the notary, and I left.” <em>“ </em>The note was put into my hands by the bank about four o’clock p. M.; went to Brown’s office; he was not in; went at six o’clock p. M., not in; went again after ten o’clock; notary asked for funds; I told him there were none.” The plaintiffs having closed, the defendants produced Misses Mary and Emeline Kelso, who proved the facts as stated by Mr. Brewster, and that one of them went down and took the notice from under the door. The defendants then offered to prove that the notice of the protest of said note was received by Mr. Kelso, and the plaintiff’s counsel objected, because the issue now trying is, whether the <em>acts done </em>by the defendants were or were <em>not sufficient in law </em>to charge the endorser of the note, and the fact whether the endorser got the notice accidentally or otherwise, is not material in the issue now trying. The court overruled the objection, and in this they were clearly right, for the breach laid in the <em>narr. </em>was, that they “ did not give nor cause to be given immediate notice of the non-payment of the note to the endorser, but wholly omitted and neglected to do so,” and proof having been given that such notice was given and received by an adult member of the family at his dwelling-house, it was certainly competent to show that it was actually received by the endorser, thus showing that the omission and neglect with which they were charged were entirely disproved. The effort is to place presumptive notice above actual notice, which cannot be permitted, the sole object of all the rules on this point being to secure to the endorser the earliest information of the dishonour, that he may take immediate measures to protect himself against loss from the default of the maker of the note, or of the drawer of the bill.</p>

    <p id="b331-7" data-blocks='[["BL_331.7",331,[200,688,1167,861]]]'>The first instruction, that if the defendants gave the note to the notary on the day it matured, and in time for protest and the giving of notice, it was sufficient, and in this there was clearly no error, and the second instruction, which appears in connection with the first, is liable to the same observation; “and,” said the learned judge, “ if the note was handed to the notary between ten and eleven at night, and he placed notice of protest, then made, under the door of the endorser, at the request of the daughter of the endorser, before twelve, and she took it up and placed it on her father’s desk, and he got it, it was sufficient.” This ruling is sustained, as we have seen, by all the authorities. But it appears, from the facts thus alluded to, that the bills of exceptions gave only portions of the evidence, and we should not have known, by anything upon their face, that the record of the suit by the same plaintiffs against E. J. Kelso, the endorser of the note, had been put in evidence at all, that proof, or some other which was not made, being necessary to show that the amount of the note was lost to the plaintiffs. We gather the fact that this record was given in evidence from the statement of the defendants in error in tlieir printed argument.</p>

There the notary, after receiving the note for protest, went to the house of the maker (about ten miles from Boston), and ai’rivod there about nine o’clock in the evening; that there was no light in the house, and the inmates appeared to have retired for the night; that he rang the bell, and after some time the maker came to the door with a light, and he presented the note, stated its contents, and demanded payment, which the maker refused, saying that he could not, or would not, or should not pay it; that he returned with the note to Charlestown, and on the same evening a proper notice of dishonour was addressed to the defendant at North Cambridge. This occurred on the 26th August 1853, and the court held the demand was sufficient to charge an endorser. If this be the law as to the demand, why should it not be the law as to notice of non-payment?</p>
