This was several years ago, and since then these associations have obtained frequent legislation, without getting any explicit renewal of what <em>they </em>suppose to be the Act of 1855. On the contrary, the subsequent legislation about premiums involves a repudiation of their interpretation. We have had occasion to speak of it in some late cases, and need not say more of it now.</p>
