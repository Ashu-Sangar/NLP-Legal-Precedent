Buildings had been erected at intervals on both sides of it, and no attempt at reclamation appears to have been made by the original owner of the soil. It seems hardly to have been contested that the street had been dedicated to public use and accepted. It was contended, however, that the dedication did not comprehend all the ground which the city graded and paved. The work was done upon no more than was thrown open and used by the public — nowhere more than forty feet in width, and in some parts not quite so much, for not quite so much in width at those places had been thrown open. But the defendants below undertook to prove that it was a street uniformly of thirty-three feet in width, and that consequently the city had no right to grade and pave more than that width and charge the expense to their lots. To show this they offered in evidence a draft of the street made in 1863, for Jacob Dellenbaugh, a tenant under the defendants, never recorded and never brought to the notice of the city. This was rejected, and its rejection is made the basis of the first assignment in error. How this draft could have shown that all had not been dedicated to the public which had been thrown open and enjoyed as a thoroughfare for more <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>than twenty years, the plaintiffs in error bare not succeeded in showing to us. And how a private draft, made or caused to be made by a tenant, and retained by him without notice to any one, could have been evidence that the owner had not dedicated all that had been thrown open, is quite incomprehensible. There was no error in rejecting it.</p>

It is a sufficient answer that the ordinance has no application to any other than a forty feet street. Wherever this street was forty feet in width the directions of the ordinance were followed; wherever it was less, the ordinance had nothing to do with it.
