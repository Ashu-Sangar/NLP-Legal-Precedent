On the 6th day of January 1800, he made another charter, antedated March 21st 1793, to correspond with the first one, in which lie changed the grant before made for public use, reserving a part <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>thereof to himself. In this last charter there was a mill mentioned, which was not built until after 1795, but which was in operation in the year 1800. It was acknowledged and recorded January 6th 1800. The reservation in this charter is as follows, viz.:</p>

Connell died in 1813, leaving a widow and children, one of whom married John W. Phillips. Phillips purchased the shares of some of the other heirs, and claimed the entire interest of Connell. In 1853 he sold the one-half of his interest (being one-fourth of the bridge, with the rights and privileges belonging thereto) to James H. White, the plaintiff. Under this purchase, White claimed the piece of land between Water street and the river, and extending from Rogers’s Mill to Spring street, as reserved by Connell in the second charter, was in possession thereof when the trespass was committed, and had been there for a number of years. There had been erected upon this piece of ground a toll-house to one of the old bridges; which house was still standing at the time of the alleged trespass.</p>

This paper is neither acknowledged or recorded, and, for the purposes of this case, was marked A, whilst the other, in the same way marked B, is witnessed by Jonathan Rowland and Alexander McLean, and is acknowledged on the 6th day of January 1800, before Jonathan Rowland, and recorded the same day in book C, p. 339. Zachariah Connell died in 1813, leaving a widow and children, one of whom married John W. Phillips.

By the deposition of Mr. Phillips, in relation to these charters, it appeared that he had not the charters, and that he had no recollection of seeing the first charter since he loaned it to Mr. Davidson; nor did he know in whose possession they were, but he thinks Mr. Davidson took a copy of them. Mr. Thomas R. Davidson, the son of Mr. William Davidson, proved that the paper marked A is a true copy of a paper exhibited to him by his father, purporting to be the original charter of the borough of Oonnellsville. He compared it with the original at the time of signing. He had no knowledge of the handwriting of the original charter. The burgess of the borough of Oonnellsville testified that he examined amongst the papers of the borough for the charters, and could find no original charter.
