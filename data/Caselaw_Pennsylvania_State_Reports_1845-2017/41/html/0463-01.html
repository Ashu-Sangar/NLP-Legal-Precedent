The city, however, has made an appropriation, guarded with reasonable provisions, which are within the scope of their power and discretion. How, then, could the plaintiff sue ? As the councils have made the appropriation, he has not demanded it from the proper officer appointed to pay the same, and without such a demand no suit is well founded: Luzerne County <em>v. </em>Day, 11 Harris 143. The appropriation to pay the sum awarded was to be paid when the city solicitor, upon proper searches, shall certify there are no liens upon the land to be taken ; and have also provided for the opening of the street.

The case of City <em>v. </em>Dickson is not a precedent for this, as the Act of 1855 was only applicable to that case, and the construction of that act was only before the court; nor was the question of the allowance of interest raised, as the city, in that case, had taken possession of the ground by laying water-pipe therein.

Petitioners under the general road laws have no right to sue; but at the end of a year, if they are not paid, all the proceedings are at an end, and they are not troubled with an apprehension, like the defendant in error, that the municipal authorities will tear away their houses from over their heads, destroy their business, and turn their families into the street, whenever the city councils determine to exercise the right of eminent domain conferred upon them by the Act of 1855. To this well-founded liability, time brings no termination; for while, according to the learned counsel’s argument, the right to sue is gone, the proceedings are not vacated; and years after the aw'ard, while the owner is in the full tide of successful business on his premises, he may be stopped in his pursuits, his business interrupted, if not totally destroyed, and the only recompense he gets, is the amount considered by a jury years before, adequate to the damage then, though the property taken may have doubled in value, and the damages to him be treble what they were when assessed. This 17th section of the act (quoted by the counsel as the 18th) was passed simply to remove a doubt which prevailed as to the concluding clause of the 7th section of the Act of 21st of April 1855, under which this suit was brought. By that concluding section, councils are authorized “to institute an inquiry as to persons benefited by the opening of <em>any </em>new street, and to withhold appropriation for the opening of the same, until the persons found to be benefited shall have contributed according to the benefit to be derived therefrom towards the damages awarded to the owners whose ground will be taken therefor.” And it was in doubt whether this applied to the opening of new streets, where the proceedings had been under the general road laws altogether. It was likewise not entirely clear whether the class of cases mentioned in that very section, namely, where councils, by ordinance, ordered <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>the opening of the street, and provided a method of obtaining payment by suit on the award, without the necessity of an appropriation by councils, were liable to be subjected to the restriction ; and it was to put an end to this obscurity, and subject both class of cases to the operation of this rule, whenever councils, by inquiry instituted, ascertained rvho were benefited, and the proportion those so benefited were to contribute towards the damages assessed to others, as “ <em>councils may have determined to he just,” </em>that the 17th section of the Act of the 13th of May 1856 was passed. In the case under consideration, no such inquiry ever was instituted by councils, no assessment upon any person for contribution was determined by councils; so that even if the proceedings had in this case, prior to this act, did not take it out of its operation, no subsequent action of councils was ever taken to bring it under its provisions. The ordinance of October 22d 1860 was not the foundation of the plaintiff’s right to recover; it formed no part of his evidence in chief, when the city solicitor took the point that no recovery could be had until appropriation had been 'made, and it was discretionary with councils when to appropriate.</p>

We could not have ruled otherwise, with the Act of April 21st 1855, P. L. 266, before us. There is no sufficient reason for applying a different rule to the present case. It was under the same Act of 1855, that Broad street was ordered to be opened through the land of the plaintiff below, and under that act a jury was appointed to assess his damages. The assessment was not completed, it is true, until after the supplementary Act of May 13th 1856, P. L. 567, was passed; neither was the assessment in the case of Dickson against the city. That supplement, even if it is <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>applicable to this case, has not taken away the right to sue, given by the Act of 1855. Both acts contemplated that the councils would make an appropriation to pay the damages assessed; but the right to sue after a year, in case of non-payment, was given, •independently of any appropriation. Possibly all the objects intended to be accomplished by the Act of 1856 may not be apparent at first sight, if at all, but the principle seems to have been to require the approval of the Court of Quarter Sessions, of the report of a jury assessing damages, before any can be paid, and to apply a common rule to proceedings to open streets, whether commenced in councils, or in the ordinary course before the court, under the general road laws. The Act of 1855 authorized the councils to withhold appropriations for opening a street, laid upon any of the public plans of the city, until the persons whom they might, upon inquiry, have found benefited, should have contributed towards the damages of the landowners. The Act of 1856 confers the same authority to withhold appropriations for opening other streets not laid upon the public plans, until owners or citizens to be benefited, shall have made such contribution as the councils determine to be just. These are clearly the principal, if not the only objects which the legislature had in view in the passage of the Act of 1856. Certainly they manifested no intention to take away, or restrict the right of a landowner to sue, which had been conferred by the Act of 1855. He could not- sue until a year had elapsed, and it may have been supposed that within that time the contributions imposed upon the persons benefited, would be paid. Whether this be so or not, if a right to withhold appropriations for opening a street, under the Act of 1855, did not debar a landowner from bringing a suit for damages after the expiration of a year, though the street be not actually opened, as was held in City <em>v. </em>'Dickson, why should the same right given by the Act of 1856 prevent a suit? We think it does not, and that the District Court was right in refusing to charge the jury that the plaintiff was not entitled to recover until the street was actually opened.</p>

In Stewart <em>v. </em>County, 2 Barr 340, it was decided, that interest on damages awarded for opening a street in the county of Philadelphia, was not demandahle until the land taken had been entered upon by the public. The road laws then in force were quite unlike the Act of 1855, under which this plaintiff claims. When Stewart <em>v. </em>The County was decided, not only could a street not be opened until the damages had been paid, but no right to sue for them was given by the statute, and after the lapse of a year without payment, the entire proceedings <a id="p470" href="#p470" data-label="470" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*470</a>were vacated. The worst that could befall the landowner, therefore, was the loss of interest for a single year, and that, it was thought, the legislature did not intend to compensate. This was a comparatively small matter; for if the damages assessed were not paid within a year, a new assessment was necessary before the road could be opened. But the Act of 1855 expressly enacted, that no proceedings to assess damages on any street laid on a public plan, shall lapse by the delay of a year in paying such damages, and it authorized a suit to be brought for the sum assessed, at the expiration of the year. Under this act, the first assessment fixes irrevocably the extent of the liability of the city, the sum due to the landowner, and the time when he has a right to his money. Delay of payment beyond that time is consequently an injury, for which the only compensation is interest. It is a common rule to allow interest for the detention of money after it should have been paid. Delay of payment is not the less •an injury, because the landowner may continue the occupation of the land. Such occupation can be but permissive, at all times subject to the paramount rights of the public. The land cannot be built upon or improved, except at the hazard of the improver, and it is worthless for sale. Its principal value has been taken away by the ordinance directing the street to be opened, and the city has acquired the right to enter at will. In our opinion, the District Court was correct in instructing the jury to find for the plaintiff the amount of the award, with interest.</p>
