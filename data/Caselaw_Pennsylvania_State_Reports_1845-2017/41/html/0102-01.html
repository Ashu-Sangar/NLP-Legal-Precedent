The plaintiff below filed a <em>narr. </em>for work and labour done, materials furnished, money expended, and specially for damages suffered by defendant below in failing to pay the debts of said boat, whereby the plaintiff was harassed and damnified, accompanied with a bill of particulars, &amp;c. To this the defendant below' pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>set-off, payment with leave, &amp;c., accompanied with bill of particulars, and specially, that plaintiff and defendant were partners in the entire transaction of the building, construction, and running of the steamboat Nebraska. The plaintiff below alleged that the contract between himself and defendant was, that he, the plaintiff, was to put the engine into the steamboat Nebraska, and if it did not answer the purpose intended, that the plaintiff was to have the privilege of taking it out, and in that event, for all other work done beyond the construction of the engine, he was to receive a fair compensation. But if the engine did answer the purpose intended, theh he was to have an interest in the boat to the extent of the value of the engine. The defendant contended that all the work done by Cumpsty, and all the materials furnished, was for an interest in the boat, to the extent of the one-third of its entire value, and that they were partners in the proportions of one-third and two-thirds.</p>

The engine did not answer the purpose intended, and the whole adventure seemed likely to prove a failure.</p>

In the fifth cross-interrogatory of plaintiff, the witness was asked, “ Were you a witness in the former suit between Cumpsty and Wright, about the engine? What business do you follow now, and why did you leave Armstrong county?” To which the witness answered: “I was; I am a confectioner by trade, am now doing -the baking and attending to the dining-room at F. Sulzner’s Hotel in this place (Athens, Limestone county, Alabama). I left Armstrong for the purpose of resuming my business of confectioner, or on a steamboat in trade on the lower Mississippi river, and in New Orleans, where I can do better than I could there, and where I claim as my home.” In the rebutting testimony of plaintiff below, the record of Armstrong county Quarter Sessions, Nos. 29 and 82, September Sessions 1860, showing indictments against Jacob Stein for riot and assisting prisoners to escape, was offered in evidence, to impeach or contradict the witness. This was objected to because the witness’s attention was not called by the interrogatory to this record, as a reason for his leaving the county, and it was therefore not proper to contradict him, nor was it evidence to impeach his veracity.

But the jury were then instructed to deduct in “ <em>proportion as the work failed to answer the purpose.” </em>What is a failure? Certainly a power that would propel the boat one mile per hour, is not a complete failure as to movement, but it is a <em>proportionate failure, </em>and one that would render the boat a complete failure as to the <em>“ </em>object intended.” The want of a bolt, a band, or the proper balancing of a wheel might cause a piece of machinery, otherwise well constructed, to perform indifferently or badly; with this remedied <a id="p108" href="#p108" data-label="108" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*108</a>it would perform well, and this would be such “ comparatively slight particular or deviation,” as in Preston <em>v. </em>Finney, would entitle a plaintiff to recover. But general instructions to “ deduct in proportion as the work failed to answer the purpose,” go far beyond the rule. The object of putting the engine and machinery in the boat, was to obtain an ordinary degree of power and speed; any failure from this, in whatever proportion, was a total failure, and the jury should have been so instructed: Miller <em>v. </em>Phillips, 7 Casey 218. 4. The error assigned in this exception raises the question, Could the jury, in this action of assumpsit, under the pleadings and the allegations as to what the contract was by both the parties, go into a settlement of the accounts as presented, if they found a partnership to exist? The instructions are, “If, however, the jury should believe there was a partnership, how stands the matter then ?” followed by comments as to the relative value of the engine. The whole of this part of the charge is predicated of the fact that the jury may find a partnership to exist. At law one partner cannot in general sue his copartner, in an action in form <em>ex contractu, </em>but must proceed by account of bill in equity; and this whether the partnership is general or particular, unless on a final balance of all accounts, a particular sum be found due : 1 Chitty on Plead. 39 ; Story on Part., §§ 218— 222, and notes on same pages; Killam <em>v. </em>Preston, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 14" data-case-ids="1856520" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0014-01">4 W. &amp; S. 14</a>; Anderson <em>v. </em>Allan, 9 S. &amp; R. 241; <a href="/watts-serg/4/0014-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 14" data-case-ids="1856520" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0014-01">Id.,</a> <a href="/watts-serg/6/0235-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 235" data-case-ids="480077" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0235-01">6 W. &amp; S. 235</a>; Van Amringe <em>v. </em>Ellmaker, 4 Barr 281; McFadden <em>v. </em>Heart, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0468-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 468" data-case-ids="478858" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0468-01">5 W. &amp; S. 468</a>.

The rule upon the subject of affecting the credibility of a witness, is clearly laid down in Cameron <em>v. </em>Montgomery, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Whart.%20132" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="5 Whart. 132">5 Whart. 132</a>; Megehan <em>v. </em>Thompson, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20541" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 541">9 W. &amp; S. 541</a>. The record of a criminal proceeding is evidence to impair the credibility of a witness: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Knap, <a href="/mass/26/0505-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="9 Pick. 496" data-case-ids="2058477" data-case-paths="/mass/26/0505-01">9 Pick. 496</a>; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Green, <a href="/mass/17/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="17 Mass. 160" data-case-ids="2036070" data-case-paths="/mass/17/0130-01">17 Mass. 160</a>, 515, 549. 2. The testimony of Dr. W. A. Bur<a id="p109" href="#p109" data-label="109" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*109</a>leigli was admissible in this case. In the case in which it was given, the identical questions were-' involved which were in issue here, to wit, whether or not a partnership existed between the plaintiff and defendant, and to what extent; and whether the purchase by Johnston, of the steamboat Nebraska, was in his own right, or in trust for the defendant, J. K. Wright. The issues were the same — the parties were the same in interest. “ Complete mutuality or identity of <em>all </em>the parties is not required; identity not in name but in interest, is enoughHaupt <em>v. </em>Henninger, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20140" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="1 Wright 140">1 Wright 140</a>. Philip Mechling, the other party defendant in the <em>replevin, </em>was a mere depositary of the engine — having no interest in the ownership, and taking no part in the case. Whether the absence of Dr. Burleigh was such as to admit his testimony, was a matter in the sound discretion of the court trying the cause: <a href="/watts/7/0309-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="7 Watts 309" data-case-ids="1846902" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0309-01">7 Watts 309</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20293" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 293">3 W. &amp; S. 293</a>; 8 S. &amp; R. 387; 10 Barr 418; Haupt <em>v. </em>Henninger, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%20140" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="1 Wright 140">1 Wright 140</a>; Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Johnston, 11 Casey 72. 3. The exception to the charge in this instance is certainly hypercritical. The undertaking of every mechanic is to do his work substantially and skilfully, with reference to the object intended. Every machine or work is designed for some practical operation, and its construction under skilful workmen is ordered with special reference to its contemplated use; any other rule would be marked by the greatest ignorance of the simplest rules of mechanics. It results from this rule, that the damages sustained by a man for whose use a piece of machinery is made, are just in proportion to the failure of the machinery to answer the purpose for which it was designed, which proportion is exclusively for the determination of the jury. It may be a total failure, or only a partial one. It may be an honest failure on the part of the mechanic, or a designed and fraudulent one, and the damages will depend upon howthe jury find the facts. 4. The theory upon which the plaintiff rested his right to recover in this case, is clearly stated in the second point put to the court, to wit, that the partnership Avas only to the extent of the engine, and that only upon condition that the engine anSAvered the purpose for which it was intended. This the plaintiff in error admits in his “history of the case.” It is true, the conclusion of the charge of the court would seem to go a little beyond this, and Ave contend that the court Avere right. This Avas a partnership upon condition, confined to a single adventure. No debts were outstanding against the firm, and no profits to divide; the whole adventure had been closed by the delivery of the engine to Cumpsty, and the payment of the price of the hull, $1000, to Wright — no equities were to be adjusted: Brubacker <em>v. </em>Robinson, 3 Penn. R. 295; Gillis <em>v. </em>McKinney, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2079" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 79">6 W. &amp; S. 79</a>; Galbraith <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/watts/2/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="2 Watts 86" data-case-ids="1840166" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0086-01">2 Watts 86</a>; Borrell <em>v. </em>Borrell, 9 Casey 492; Curtin <em>v. </em>Cameron, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Whart.%20279" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="5 Whart. 279">5 Whart. 279</a>. This part of the <a id="p110" href="#p110" data-label="110" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*110</a>charge, however, did no wrong to the plaintiff in error, and therefore he has no right to complain. The relative values of the engine and the hull were admitted facts. The engine $500, and the hull $1000; the whole adventure was, therefore, $1500. The rights of the parties were as one to two : Cumpsty one-third, and Wright two-thirds. They had received, by their own admissions, precisely in this proportion, and. if the jury had adopted this view of the case their verdict would have been for the defendant. In no event could it have been for the plaintiff to the amount for which it was returned. This court have the right to follow the charge into the jury-room and watch its effect; and if it produce no effect they will refuse to reverse, even if the charge be erroneous. This view is fully sustained by these authorities: <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Whart.%20292" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="6 Whart. 292">6 Whart. 292</a>; 17 Penna.

He had not denied that such bills had been found, for he was not asked the question. How, then, did the existence of the bills contradict him ? If he had denied the fact of their existence after being asked, then if that fact was relevant to the issue, they might have been given in evidence to contradict him. The nature of the evidence to contradict being two solitary facts, not necessarily in the mind of the witness when testifying, or of the essence of his testimony, he surely should have been asked about them before his answer could be contradicted by proof of their existence. This is undoubtedly the general rule: 2 Greenl. §§ 462, 467; McAteer <em>v. </em>Mullen, 2 Barr 32. The witness was asked his reasons for leaving Armstrong county, and he replied that he had left to engage in his business as a confectioner on the Mississippi river. Now, the bills of indictment were offered to show that he gave a false reason. They were improperly received, for two reasons. First, the question was about irrelevant matter, and could not be contradicted. Courts will not indulge parties in trying collateral issues that have nothing to do with the case, and hence an irrelevant answer, as it is presumed to have and ought to have no effect on the case trying, must be taken as true, and therefore no contradiction is allowed. Secondly, the evidence did not contradict the witness. The existence of the indictments found did not prove anything outside of themselves; much less did they contradict the reason given for leaving the county, or even raise a presumption that it was not true.</p>

      <a id="p111" href="#p111" data-label="111" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*111</a>But after all, we think the error was innoxious in so far as this case is concerned. Stein proved no partnership between the plaintiff and defendants, and this was the object in taking his testimony. He proved but little, and that little went to establish a joint ownership to the extent of one-third in the boat; but it made out no partnership in the legal acceptation of the term, nor nothing like it. As therefore he proved nothing beneficial to the defendant, or which could have benefited his defence, he cannot complain that he was injured.</p>
    <p id="b113-6" data-blocks='[["BL_113.6",113,[155,803,1169,559]]]'>The next assignment of error is to the reception of what Dr. Burleigh had sworn on a former trial between these same parties, about the matter of the contract about this boat, he being out of the state at the trial. We think the identity of the subject-matters in dispute was the same in both actions, and so were the parties, excepting that, owing to the nature of the action, being replevin, a stranger to the contract which was involved in that controversy was included, but the parties here were parties plaintiff and defendant there, and we think the identity is sufficient, and brings the admission of the evidence within the ruling in the Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Johnston, 11 Harris 72, and Haupt <em>v. </em>Henninger, <a href="/wright/1/0139-02" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="1 Wright 138" data-case-ids="625957,626029,626098" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0139-02,/wright/1/0139-01,/wright/1/0138-01">1 Wright 138</a>, and the rule as stated in 1 Greenl. 163, 164. This assignment of error therefore fails.</p>
    <p id="b113-7" data-blocks='[["BL_113.7",113,[155,1362,1168,559]]]'>3. The third error is to the charge of the court. The declaration was for a <em>quantum meruit, </em>and unless this was met by showing a special contract, it was not within the rule of actions on entire contracts, where entire performance or its equivalent must be alleged, and be followed by proof showing complete performance or dispensation therewith by the party entitled to performance. Preston <em>v. </em>Finney, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2055" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 55">2 W. &amp; S. 55</a>, and Miller <em>v. </em>Phillips, 7 Casey 218, were of this class. But no such special contract was declared on or shown in this ease, and hence, for defective workmanship a compensation might be allowed by a deduction from the amount claimed; or if the work was worth nothing, a jury might so find by their verdict. The judge committed no error in this part of his charge.</p>
    <p id="b113-8" data-blocks='[["BL_113.8",113,[155,1921,1180,516]],["BL_114.1",114,[310,422,1166,1455]]]'>4. But a further error is assigned to the charge, in which the court seems to expound the law so as to allow the jury to settle.’ the indebtedness of the parties even if a partnership should be found to exist. I doubt whether there was a technical partnership proved in the case, but if there was, it does not follow that there Ayas error in allowing the jury, in the equitable action of <em>assumpsit, </em>to settle the rights of the parties, as there Avas no pretence that there Avere any debts due by or in favour of the firm. If it was a partnership, it was in the ownership of the boat. It was alleged that one Avas to contribute the hull and the other the engine, the former to bo tAvo-thirds owner and the latter one-third. It was a question whether Wright had not got the <a id="p112" href="#p112" data-label="112" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*112</a>hull, and it was a fact that Cumpsty had got the engine; but the court said, “If, however, the engine as got by Cumpsty was worth less than one-third of the entire proceeds, then plaintiff would be entitled to recover what would make him equal.” It would be difficult to see what might be coming to plaintiff if the possession of the engine which he had got by his action of <em>replevin </em>Avere equal to one-third: but the question of partnership was pressed on the other side, and the general question, irrespective of this assignment, was contended for by the plaintiff in error. Even if this Avere so, the transaction being a single one, the plaintiff might recover what Avould make him equal with his copartner, and to this effect clearly are the cases of Brubaker <em>v. </em>Robinson, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20P.%20R.%20295" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="3 P. R. 295">3 P. R. 295</a>, Gillis <em>v. </em>McKinney, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2079" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 79">6 W. &amp; S. 79</a>, Galbraith <em>v. </em>Moore, <a href="/watts/2/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="2 Watts 86" data-case-ids="1840166" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0086-01">2 Watts 86</a>, Borrell <em>v. </em>Borrell, 9 Casey 492. The old doctrine of the books, Avhich requires a balance to be struck, and an express promise to pay it, or to pay any balance to be ascertained in cases like the present, does not now exist to the extent formerly held. This is abundantly shown in Van Amringe <em>v. </em>Ellmaker, 4 Barr 281; in Gillis <em>v. </em>McKinney, and in Borrell <em>v. </em>Borrell, <em>supra. </em>In these cases the doctrine of a recovery on an implied promise is clearly held. It is certain there are authorities to the contrary, but the cases cited are among the latest on the subject. They show a disposition of the courts to remove, whenever it can be done, the necessity for a resort to the cumbrous remedy by account render. While the action still remains a remedy, appropriate in cases of trading and dealing as partners, the disposition is to limit rather than enlarge the necessity for it as a remedy; and in the later cases cited, it is superseded as between partners in a single transaction or adventure, only. The objection here at most only raises a question of remedy and not of right, as was said in Van Amringe <em>v. </em>Ellmaker, and every purpose of justice may be as well attained in an equitable action of <em>assumpsit </em>as in account render. We see no error'calling for a reversal of the judgment in this case. And the</p>
