J. Kennedy for $1188.37, on which judgment was entered on the 22d September 1859, and <em>ajft,, fa. </em>issued to No. 89 August Term 1859, by virtue of which a levy was made upon the property mentioned in the replevin, as well as other property of the said M. J. Kennedy, <a id="p186" href="#p186" data-label="186" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*186</a>which were sold by the sheriff, but the amount made was not sufficient to satisfy the judgment. On the 22d December 1859, the defendant in the replevin filed an affidavit of Austin J. Kennedy, setting forth a certain alleged agreement between the plaintiff and defendant relative to the goods levied upon, and then moved the court to direct an issue to be formed, in which the said Madison J. Kennedy shall be plaintiff, and the said Catharine Kennedy defendant, to try the right of the said Madison to have a credit on the said judgment for the amount of loss sustained by said Madison by the sale of said goods at sheriff’s sale, in violation of said agreement, on which affidavit and motion the court made the following order: “ December 22d 1859, the court direct an issue on the within application, to ascertain what credit, if there be any, the said Madison J. Kennedy may be entitled to, arising out of the facts within alleged, in which the said Madison is to be the plaintiff, and the said Catharine Kennedy shall be the defendant. The plaintiff to file a <em>narr. </em>in <em>indebitatus assumpsit </em>within twenty days, to which the defendant shall plead <em>non assumpsit, </em>and thereupon the parties to proceed to trial.” This was accordingly done. There is some difference in the statements of this order in the docket entries, or abstract of the proceedings, the word “money” appearing in them instead of “ credit.”</p>

Kennedy, a son of Mrs. Kennedy, and a brother of the plaintiff in the feigned issue, testified that he made a contract with his mother and D. 0.

Such unsuccessful attempts to control the final process of the court, and to pay a judgment by damages for breach of an alleged contract or agreement, uncertain in its character, and in one respect practically impossible, should be frowned upon by the courts. Their tendency is to foster litigation, and to make it interminable, to the certain detriment of both parties.</p>
