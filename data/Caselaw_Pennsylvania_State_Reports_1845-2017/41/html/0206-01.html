Where is the evidence in the case it was ever perfected? The court would intimate it was in the deed from Thomas S. Christie to George Crane, and is the same deed given in evidence under our bill of exceptions. How does that help the case ? There is not a spark of evidence in the case that Todd’s title was in <em>any way connected </em>with George Crane’s title. That deed showed most clearly an outstanding title to this land in Crane. If Crane ever conveyed to Todd it was for them to show it.

It is a contract to execute certain deeds or pay $2000. The defendant, in the court below, might have shown that the land was worth less than $2000. He did not attempt it, but rested his defence on other grounds. It was not a penalty in the sense of either the cases cited by the plaintiff in error. This case does not present a question of damages, but simply a construction of the agreement of the parties, in which the courts must be governed, not by their view of the policy or propriety of the bargain, but by the intention of the parties. Todd did not surely agree to deed his land to Burr, and receive therefor a nominal sum. The contract was one in which a court of equity would decree a specific performance.</p>

Inf such cases the measure of damages is the value of the land at | the time it ought to have been conveyed: Cox’s Administrators <em>v. </em>Henry, 8 Casey 18, and the cases cited. In McClowry <em>v. </em>Croghan’s Administrators, 1 Grant’s Cases 307, this subject was greatly discussed upon the authorities, and it was held by Judge Williams, of the District Court of Allegheny county, that the breach of a contract to lease is the same as a breach of a contract to sell land, and that the measure of damages in such a case is the price paid for the lease and its interest, and not the value of the bargain.</p>

That the same rule prevails in respect to parol contracts was abundantly shown in Malaun <em>v. </em>Ammon, 1 Grant’s Cases 123, afterwards approved by the whole court in Hertzogg <em>v. </em>Hertzogg, 10 Casey 418, and Dumars <em>v. </em>Miller, <a href="/citations/?q=18%20Johns.%20Rep.%20219" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="18 Johns.

What the obligee was entitled to receive was the stipulated titles, or their value. And their value was to be estimated as the parties estimated it in the bargain of exchange. In other words, the value of that which the plaintiff was to receive is to be measured by the value of that which he gave.</p>

      <a id="p214" href="#p214" data-label="214" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*214</a>In regard to the admission of the deed from Thomas S. Christie to George Crane, we are inclined to believe, from the very unsatisfactory statements of the paper-books, there was no error. It is nowhere explained that Todd claimed title under Crane, but we conjecture that such was the fact. If such were the fact, it was very competent to show the only defect in Crane’s title cured by the Christie deed, and that deed would cure it, for it enured to the benefit of Todd and his alienee. If, however, Todd did not claim under Crane, the evidence would seem to be irrelevant. The paper-books are very full of evidence touching the bargain between Todd and Burr, but as they do not exhibit the derivation of Todd’s title, we will assume it to be as the court must have understood it when they admitted the Christie deed. We consequently see no error in admitting the deed.</p>

They could not omit the qualification in regard to the waiver of inspection of the land, for it was in the evidence.
