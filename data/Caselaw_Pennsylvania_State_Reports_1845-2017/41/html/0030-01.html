The plaintiffs’ claim was a book account, commencing October 8th 1856, and running to October 1857, and was closed by a note of Drennen &amp; Patterson for $517.53, on which this suit was brought.</p>
    <p id="b39-10" data-blocks='[["BL_39.10",39,[178,1857,1166,559]]]'>On the part of the defendants two agreements, both dated the 16th of September 1856, were given in evidence — the first between Francis Patterson and his brother William E. Patterson, substituting the latter in the place of the former, in the article of the 24th of July 1856, and the other an agreement for a partnership between the said Drennen and William EAving Patterson. Neither of these Avere made public, and certainly were entirely unknown to Mr. Walker, when he took the notes of Drennen &amp; Patterson. It is certainly a little singular, that the last agreement says, that by the agreement of 24th of July 1856, Francis Patterson and Drennen had made arrangements for going into the mercantile business in Elizabeth, and the counsel for the defendant asks the court to negative that construction.</p>

      <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>. The assignments of error relate first to the admission or rejection of testimony, which we will first dispose of.</p>
    <p id="b40-5" data-blocks='[["BL_40.6",40,[300,512,1162,299]]]'>1. There was no error in admitting evidence of the declaration of Drennen, that the firm was composed of himself and Francis Patterson. It was evidence against himself, and was so stated by the court. In the same manner, the declarations of Francis, that he was a partner with Drennen, were evidence against Francis, and the two sets of declarations showed that both agreed that they were partners.</p>
    <p id="b40-6" data-blocks='[["BL_40.7",40,[300,811,1162,216]]]'>The 2d error is not sustained — the record not showing that any such testimony was given, and of course the defendants suffered no injury — and this disposes of the 4th assignment of error, as the court could not be called on to admit testimony, to rebut what does not appear to have been given in evidence.</p>
    <p id="b40-7" data-blocks='[["BL_40.8",40,[301,1027,1163,213]]]'>4. The court were right in rejecting the deed of the 24th of February 1858, which was long after the transaction in question had happened, and could have no retrospective effect upon it. The 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th assignments of error relate to the charge of the court, and their answers to the defendants’ points.</p>
    <p id="b40-8" data-blocks='[["BL_40.9",40,[304,1241,1164,841]]]'>It seems clear from what we have already said, that the court could not affirm the naked proposition, that the agreement of 24th of July did not constitute the defendants partners in law, and that the court went as far as they could be required to go. It was a most important link in the chain to prove a partnership, and, connected with its consummation in October, made out a <em>strong primd facie </em>case, at the least, of partnership. So, the answer to the second point is perfectly proper, or otherwise two persons might hold themselves out to the world as partners, say to every one that they are partners, and years afterwards, a secret article of partnership between the irresponsible partner, and another irresponsible person of the same surname, as the only responsible party, may be produced to relieve him, and defraud all the creditors of the firm, who have given credit to it solely on the faith of his name. The third point is correctly answered, and we do not perceive that any injustice was done by the remarks of the court, objected to in the 8th assignment of error, followed as they were by the statement basing the courts’ instruction upon the assumption, that the papers were correctly dated.</p>
    <p id="b40-9" data-blocks='[["BL_40.10",40,[308,2094,1160,84]]]'>The charge of the court was. a liberal and fair one, and if we had the power, we would not disturb the verdict.</p>
    <p id="b40-10" data-blocks='[["BL_40.11",40,[1082,2180,340,42]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
