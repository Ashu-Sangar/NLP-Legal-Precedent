No more so than to erect the breakwater, which they did, or in the contract to build a dwelling-house on the lots conveyed, as in Hamilton <em>v. </em>Elliott, 5 S. &amp; R. 375; or in the undertaking to pay certain bonds given by the grantors, as in Bear <em>v. </em>Whisler, <a href="/watts/7/0144-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts 144" data-case-ids="1846813" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0144-01">7 Watts 144</a>; or in the conditions imposed on the grantee, that at her death she should leave lawful issue that would live to the age of twenty-one years, as in Westenberger <em>v. </em>Reist, 1 Harris 594.

In the older cases cited in their support, many conditions less explicit than this were held to create contingent estates, subject to revert or take another channel upon non-compliance. Here the time and place within which the condition was to be performed are clearly designated, viz.: within two years, and within the city limits, on these lots, or elsewhere in the city.</p>

Then, as the anticipated benefits to result from the performance of the condition were incidental or collateral, and to the person or body politic of the grantor, and not to the estate granted, no encumbrance or peril to the title is created by this condition. Nor does the objection that the grant thus interpreted tends to create a perpetuity or an inalienable .estate, apply to this condition. Whenever performed, the title would have become absolute so far as that was concerned. Indeed, if the bloomery had been built, the ultimate incidental advantages to the city would have been an equivalent for the ground-rent, the payment of which, it has been held, may be made the contingency upon which a fee should vest.</p>

If two conditions are imposed as preliminary to the acquisition of title, the first possible and the second impossible, the law may relieve against the consequences of not performing the latter. But this furnishes no excuse for non-compliance with the former, which is legal and possible. A man must do justice before he asks equity. This is not a case for the infliction of penalties on the grantor, who may have innocently, though unadvisedly embraced in his contract a condition which the law in its policy cannot sanction. The law regards all forfeitures with disfavour. While it will protect the title of the alienee against incongruous and uncertain conditions calculated to bind or fetter- it in its transmission, it will at the same time be just to the alienor, by allowing him all the legal consideration for which he stipulated. Otherwise, a vendor might avoid the payment of the entire consideration of his purchase by the insertion in his contract of some trivial or unimportant condition, which turns out to be against the policy of the law, such as a restraint upon alienation. Such a rule would not be in harmony with the justice which our laws seek always to administer.</p>

We do not so understand the action of the city councils. At the request of the defendants the councils resolved <em>‘ </em>that the Sharon Iron Company be permitted to erect a good and substantial blast furnace on their water-lots, or within the limits of the city, instead of a bloomery, &amp;c.,’ and extend the time for its construction to the 1st of November 1855. There is no waiver of any rights either asked or granted. The defendants asked a favour, not a forfeiture, and it was granted. Is there any justice in visiting upon the plaintiff the penalty of a forfeiture of its title for yielding to the earnest request of the vendees in a matter affecting their interests alone, and without any consideration? The fairest interpretation to be given to the action of the councils is, that it was a consent on their part not to insist on their right of defeasance, if the vendees would erect, as they proposed, a blast furnace in their city by November 1st 1855. They exacted no contract, took no covenant from defendants to do so; but <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>had the furnace been built, equity would have relieved the defendants against an attempt on the part of the plaintiff to reenter, on account of their not having built the bloomery.

The Sharon Iron Company did not within two years erect a good and substantial bloomery on these lots, nor within the limits of the city. But upon the petition of the agent of the Sharon Iron Company, the Select and Common Councils of the city of Erie, on the 10th July 1854, passed the following preamble and resolution: — “ Whereas, the Sharon Iron Company, by virtue of a resolution passed by the Select and Common Councils of the city of Erie, September 1st 1851, purchased of said city ten water-lots, east of Holland street, on certain conditions specified in said resolution, one of which conditions being ‘ that the said company shall in two years erect a good and substantial bloomery thereon, or within the limits of the cityand whereas, it is now thought, on account of the result of more recent experiments, that the interest of the company will be best promoted by the use of a ‘ blast furnace’ instead of a ‘bloomery,’ while the change will be equally if not more advantageous to the city; therefore, Be it resolved by the Select and <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>Common Councils, That the Sharon Iron Company be permitted to erect a good and substantial ‘ blast furnace’ on their water-lots, or within the limits of the city, instead of a bloomery, as required by the resolution aforesaid, above referred to, and further, that the time for the construction of said works be extended until 1st November 1855.”</p>
    <p id="b353-6" data-blocks='[["BL_353.6",353,[138,670,1170,1632]]]'>The blast furnace never was built, the company failed, and the property in question has passed into other hands. The clause in the original resolution incorporated into the deed was a condition, not a covenant, and “ where the language imports a condition merely, and there are no words importing an agreement, it cannot be enforced as a covenant, but the only remedy is through a forfeiture of the estate.” “But upon principle,” says Selden, J., delivering the opinion of the Court of Appeals in Palmer <em>v. </em>Fort Plain and Cooperstown Plank-Road Company, 1 Keenan 389, “ independent of all authority, it would seem impossible to come to any other conclusion. It by no means follows, because a grantee consents to take an estate subject to a certain condition, that he also consents to obligate himself personally for the performance of the condition. Many cases might be imagined in which one would be willing to risk the forfeiture of the estate, while he would be altogether unwilling to incur the hazard of a personal responsibility in addition.” Now, this clearly was a condition only, and was broken at the end of the two years, and the city of Erie might have taken advantage of it and re-entered upon these premises; but instead of doing this, they dispensed with the condition and waived the forfeiture, permitting their grantees to do something else. The original condition is therefore gone, and, as a condition, is as if it had never made a part of the original conveyance. This is clear law, and although Dumpor’s Case, 4 Coke’s Rep. 119, was quarrelled with by Sir James Mansfield, it was the undoubted law of England until altered by a late Act of Parliament (22 &amp; 23 Victoria, ch. 35), and has been recognised in this state, New York, and other states of the Union. Chancellor Walworth, in Williams <em>v. </em>Dakin, <a href="/citations/?q=22%20Wend.%20209" class="citation" data-index="30" data-cite="22 Wend. 209">22 Wend. 209</a>, in speaking of this case, says: “But although that decision has so long been acquiesced in as a settled rule of law, in relation to the title to real property which was liable to be forfeited by the breach of a condition subsequent, that it should not now be disturbed, it ought not to be extended to other cases. That decision proceeded upon the principle that where an estate is granted upon a <em>condition </em>subsequent, if the condition is once dispensed with the estate becomes absolute in the grantee, and cannot be divested by any future breach.”</p>
