Some treat the phrases, inevitable accident, perils of the sea, navigation, or road, as entirely equivalent to the phrase, act of God, as used by lawyers and judges; and others treat them as expressing different ideas. Again, some treat them as identical terms, for the purpose of making inevitable accident mean act of God, in the sense of a sudden and violent act of nature, as lightning, tempests, &amp;c., while others make them equivalent for the purpose of making act of God mean any accident which the carrier cannot, by proper care, foresight, and skill, avoid. And many of them overlook entirely the common custom of merchants, which is the common law in such matters, that all bills of lading, and all the printed forms of them, contain the exception against losses by inevitable accident, perils or dangers of the sea or road, &amp;c. No man expects any other form unless when he specially contracts for it; and therefore no man is in danger of being caught up by the technical phrase, act of God, unless when he has failed to sign the usual bill of lading. If he signs the bill he is held according to the usual custom of commerce; he ought to be held no otherwise when he fails to sign it.</p>

We suppose there never was a time when bills of lading did not contain the exception against the inevitable dangers of the sea or road, though the law always implied it. We pick up the evidence of it as far back as 1629 and 1670, Palmer 551, 3 Keble 73, and doubt not that it may be much more remotely traced.</p>

Moreover, Coke used the phrase, the act of God excuses, as equivalent to <em>impotentia excusat </em>legem, and also as equivalent to an accident ■which is “ so inevitable that, by no providence or industry of him who is bound, it can be prevented,” or, as in Shelley’s Case, “which no industry could avoid nor policy prevent.” Again, .he uses the phrase in 1601, as applicable to a sudden storm: 1 Bulst. 280, 1 Roll. Rep. 79; and certainly that is one of the many kinds of inevitable accidents that may be so described.</p>

It is used also by the judges in Coggs <em>v. </em>Bernard: Lord Raym. 909, in 1704; but they do not define their meaning in using it, and the case did not require it, and they give no indication that they attached to it any other than what had been its usual meaning. Holt, C. J., in his opinion, refers to Morse <em>v. </em>Sluce, as the leading case on the subject: 3 Keb. 72, 112, 135; 1 Vent. 190, 238 ; 1 Mod. 49, in 1670; and there the court say, 3 Keb. 114, that the carrier is “ not liable for inevitable accident, when it is <em>vis cui resistí non </em>potestand Hale, C.

R. 27, introduced a somewhat different view; holding that, to be an act of God, it must be such a one “ as could not happen by the intervention of man, as storms, 1'ightning, and tempests.” He calls this a liability independent of the contract, and says it appears in all the cases for the last <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>hundred years; and yet we confess that we have not been able to discover that this statement has even a general accuracy. And there is no need of a warranty or insurance independent of the contracts, for it is expressed in them in the words safely to carry and to deliver in good order, which are to be found in all carriers’ contracts, when they are written; and which are therefore implied, as within the intention of the parties when the contract is not written. The contract of insurance in these words is quite absolute; but it is not reasonable to receive it so, for it is not so intended; and the difficulty has always been to define the <em>excep-1 </em>tions to it.</p>

Act of God no more excludes human agency, than such terms as <em>Peo miente, Peo juvante, ex visitatione Pei; </em>Providential dispensation, or the Roman terms, <em>fataliter, divinitus, easus fortuities, damnum fatale, </em>all of which originally referred to the intervention of the gods, in the sense that the appropriate human agency was powerless. It is only by an arbitrary definition of the term that we depart from the meaning of the contract, and fall into difficulties in administering rights under it.</p>

When rights depend on the life of a man, they are determined by his death, if it be not caused by him who owed the duty; and this death is called the act of God, whether it proceeds from nature, accident, carelessness, or suicide.</p>

It is by the intervention of man that vessels bound to and from England keep so far north as to fall in with icebergs and sometimes be destroyed by them. There is human intervention when a vessel is driven by a storm against a wharf, or pier, or bridge, constructed by men. If a storm drives a vessel from her mooring, by dragging her anchor or parting her cable, it is because the human means of holding her are insufficient. If a death happen by an inevitable accident in the working of mines or other excavations, or in <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>conducting steamworks, or by tbe fall of a house or of some fragment of it, there is human intervention, and yet it may very properly be reported as a death <em>ex visitatione Dei. </em>It is impossible, therefore, to define inevitable accidents by excluding the element of the intervention of man; for this element itself needs definition.

In the performance of that duty it has three points to which its attention must be directed. In the first place, it must see that the nature of the necessity (or accident) pleaded be such as the law itself would respect, for there may be a necessity that it would not. A necessity created by a man’s own act, with a fair previous knowledge of the consequences that would follow, and under circumstances which he then had a power of controlling, is of that nature. Secondly, that the party who was so placed, used all practicable endeavours to surmount the difficulties which already formed that necessity, and which, on fair trial, he found insurmountable. I do not mean all the endeavours which the wit of man, as it exists in the actual understanding, might suggest; but such as might reasonably be expected from a fair degree of discretion and an ordinary knowledge of business. Thirdly, that all this shall appear by distinct and unsuspected testimony; for the positive injunctions of the law (or terms of the contract), if proved to be violated, can give way to nothing but the clearest proof of the necessity that compelled the violation.”</p>

It is, therefore,.because he is presumed, and almost conclusively presumed, to be in fault in such cases, that he is held liable; and not because he has a remedy over against the wrongdoer, or the township, or hundred: 1 Salk. 143. He is not liable when robbed by pirates on the high seas or by the public enemies, because against these he has no police protection, and there is no presumption of fault on his part.</p>

The carrier is bound to carry safely, and if he fail to do so, the burden of proof of a valid excuse is cast upon him. If he show a cause which the law admits to be sufficiently serious to be called inevitable, he has merely prepared the way for showing that he used 'all possible care. At this stage of the case, the law does not presume any fault on his part; but simply demands that he shall complete his excuse by showing that, in the midst of the danger, he exerted all the ski'll and care he could to avoid it. If this be made out, then he stands entirely without fault before the law, having performed his whole duty under his contract, as <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>it is interpreted by the law, according to the customs of merchants and carriers.</p>
    <p id="b387-6" data-blocks='[["BL_387.6",387,[156,510,1166,605]]]'>Now, if, instead of charging him because his excuse leaves him still in fault, we charge him because he has a remedy over, Owen 57, Moor 462, then we should have to inquire of the fact, has he such a remedy as can be of any avail to him. He has none, of course, in a case of inevitable collision, without fault on either side. He may have none where the other vessel is sunk by the accident. He may have none, if the collision happened off the coast of Africa, or his vessel be seized by order of some foreign government. He can have none that is available, if the opposite parties to the collision are irresponsible. Surely we have no evidence in commercial customs that a carrier insures against such accidents, and for such a reason. And if such were the reason, then there is no insurance when both colliding vessels are free from fault, for then neither has any remedy.</p>
    <p id="b387-7" data-blocks='[["BL_387.7",387,[155,1113,1165,431]]]'>And certainly the law cannot impose such a liability for such a reason; for one state cannot make laws for another state, as it would do by saying that the injured vessel shall have its remedy against the wrongdoer wherever he may be found. If the law imposes the insurance, “independent of the contract,” instead of enforcing the terms that are involved in it, then the insurance cannot reach beyond the state which imposes it, for no state enforces the mere law of another state, while all civilized states do enforce contracts made abroad, according as those contracts were understood in the place where they were made.</p>
    <p id="b387-8" data-blocks='[["BL_387.8",387,[154,1543,1163,340]]]'>We might easily carry out these views so as to show that the defendants, being without fault in this collision, are not liable; but we prefer not to do it. We rather wish that what we have said, may be useful in leading to an investigation that will expose, in a conclusive way, the fundamental mistake which has led to so'much discordance as prevails in the decisions of courts, and between many of them and the actual customs of trade. We can decide this case well on other grounds.</p>
    <p id="b387-9" data-blocks='[["BL_387.9",387,[152,1883,1163,257]]]'>We are quite satisfied that the weight of authority and of reason, shows that the ordinary exceptions in bills of lading of unavoidable accidents, have a much larger sphere than that which is attributed to the term act of God, by the very strict interpretation of some writers and judges; while, for the present, we think that expression has been unduly narrowed.</p>
    <p id="b387-10" data-blocks='[["BL_387.10",387,[151,2141,1164,299]]]'>There are cases where there is no bill of lading, or where the ordinary exception of perils of the sea does not appear, and where the innocent carrier is held liable: 1 Wright’s Ohio Eep. 193; or where both were innocent and both liable: 2 Zabriskie 372; <a href="/citations/?q=27%20Me.%20133" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="27 Me. 133">27 Maine 133</a>. These cases must proceed upon the notion that there is an insurance against collision, and other analogous accidents, where at least, the usual exceptions are not provided.</p>

They mean that they shall not be answerable as insurers against accidents which the law respects as inevitable; but that, if they prove such an accident falling upon them without any previous fault of theirs, and that they had a proper vessel and crew, and did all in their power to extricate themselves from the danger, they shall be as free from liability as they are from fault. We think, therefore, that this case was rightly decided.</p>
