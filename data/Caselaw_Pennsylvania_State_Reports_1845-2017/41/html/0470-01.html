To this the defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit, </em>and on the trial, requested the court to instruct the jury, that “ the plaintiffs having shown no license to sell the vinous and spirituous liquors in controversy, are not entitled to recover in this suit.” The court below (Hegins, P. J.) after reciting the facts, charged: — “ The plaintiffs in this case claim to recover the value of a lot of liquors sold and delivered to the defendant, who was an innkeeper in this county. The first ground .of defence is, that the sale and delivery of the liquors was made by their agent in this county. The plaintiffs are wholesale liquor dealers, and, it is alleged, are licensed there to sell vinous and spirituous liquors by the gallon, and in larger quantities. A license to sell vinous and spirituous liquors in Philadelphia, would not authorize them to sell in this county; and if the contract of sale was made by the plaintiffs’ agent in this county, and delivery here made in pursuance of it, the plaintiffs cannot recover, and your verdict sho'uld be for the defendant.</p>

He would be bound both to plead and prove the matter he relied on. Nothing like this was done here, and the judgment must be affirmed.</p>
