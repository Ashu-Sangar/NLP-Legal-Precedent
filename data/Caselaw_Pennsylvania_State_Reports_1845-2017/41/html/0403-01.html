There is no temptation to widen it by judicial construction — the inclination of the judicial mind is rather to narrow it. But as it is a trust for the people of Pennsylvania, judges have no right, from motives of ease and convenience, to surrender, weaken, or obscure, by judicial refinements, one single one of the powers granted. The legislature may qualify them, and in a few instances have done so, as in the Justices Act of 1810, where the Courts of Common Pleas are empowered to issue <em>cettioraries </em>to justices of the peace, and to give judgments thereupon, which shall be final, “ and no writ of error shall issue thereon.” In numerous decisions it has been held that these words oust our jurisdiction over judgments rendered by the Common Pleas on <em>certioraris </em>to justices of the peace. The result of the authorities touching the general subject of our appellate jurisdiction, was well stated by the present chief justice, in Gorsline <em>v. </em>Place, 8 Casey, when he said: “ The judicial authority of this court extends to the review and correction of all proceedings of all inferior courts, <em>except where such, review is expressly excluded hy statute.” </em>There is a class of cases in our books which would seem to establish another exception — that of a case stated by the parties, wherein they agree to submit their disputes to the Common Pleas, without expressly reserving their right to a writ of error. The first of these cases was Fuller <em>v. </em>Trevor, 8 S. &amp; R. 529, which was an amicable reference of a pending cause to <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>referees, subject to the opinion of the court on all legal points and objections. The Court of Common Pleas rendered judgment on the report of the referees, and this court held that a writ of error would not lie to that judgment, because the agreement did not provide that the case should “ be considered as of the nature of a special verdict and subject to a writ of error.” In Kline <em>v. </em>Guthart, 2 Penna. R. 495, which was a reference under the Act of 1705, and a judgment on the award, Gibson, C. J., gave the <em>rationale </em>of the ground on which a writ of error is denied to such judgments. He regarded awards as in the nature of verdicts, exceptions to them as motions for a new trial, and judgments upon them as overruling such motions ; and inasmuch as writs of error never go to verdicts, nor to mere discretionary exercises of power by the courts, such records are not reviewable here. To the same effect were Wilson <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 3 Penna. R. 532, and Berg <em>v. </em>Moore, 7 Barr 94; whilst Davis <em>v. </em>Barr, 5 S. &amp; R. 516, and Kelley <em>v. </em>Shoenberger, <a href="/watts/7/0394-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="7 Watts 394" data-case-ids="1846870" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0394-01">7 Watts 394</a>, frequently cited to the same point, are not applicable to it, as any one will see who consults them. If, then, we have an established exception, additional to the one exception stated by the chief justice in Gorsline <em>v. </em>Place, it is where a case is referred by agreement of parties to an auditor or referees, without an express reservation of the right of review, and the Court of Common Pleas passes only on exceptions to their report. The presumption of law is, in such cases, that the parties meant to bind themselves by the award of the domestic tribunal of their own providing, and therefore we leave them bound; for, whilst consent of parties cannot confer jurisdiction upon us, it may take it away. I need not allude to another class of cases, such as viewers of land damages and other special statutory tribunals, between whom and this court there is no recognised relation whatever, for these do not fall within the range of the present discussion.</p>

This is necessary to all appellate jurisdictions, where cases come up by writs of error or <em>certiorari. </em>The only mode provided by law for bringing evidence or the opinion of an inferior court upon what is- technically called “the record,” is by a bill of exceptions, sealed and certified by the judge; and, as bills of exception are not allowed in the Quarter Sessions, no question <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>■which arises out of the evidence in that court can be got up into this court. Hence, whilst <em>certiorari </em>lies to the proceedings of the Quarter Sessions, in road eases, in pauper cases, in contested election cases, and in other statutory causes committed to the jurisdiction of that court, the writ brings up nothing but what appears upon the record, without a bill of exceptions. Our correctional power extends no farther in such cases than to keep the court within the limits of its jurisdiction, and to see that that is exercised with regularity according to law: Carpenter’s Case, 2 Harris 486; Mifflin Township <em>v. </em>Elizabeth, 6 Id. 17; Union Canal Co. <em>v. </em>Keiser, 7 Id. 134; Mauch Chunk <em>v. </em>Nescopeck, 9 Id. 46. And especially is this the rule, where, as in Carpenter’s Case, the statute under which the proceeding is had declares that the Common Pleas “ shall proceed upon the <em>merits </em>and determine <em>finally </em>upon the same.” Though bills of exception do prevail in the Courts of Common Pleas, the legislature may restrict our jurisdiction, and these words have been held to restrict it in the manner above stated. Neither these words nor any equivalents, however, are found in the Acts of Assembly under which the present case is prosecuted, and we are, therefore, under no special restrictions. The Act of 3d May 1850, Purd. 239, provides that the elections of district attorneys shall be contested and decided in the manner provided for contesting the election of county officers, and by the 153d section of the General Election Law of 2d July 1839, Purd. 300, the Courts of Quarter Sessions have jurisdiction to hear and determine the contested elections of county and township officers— nothing being said about the finality of the courts’ decree, as in the act of the same date relating to the election of prothonotaries, &amp;c., under which Carpenter’s Case occurred.</p>

Such, however, is not the meaning of the reference. The reference is, rather, to the provision of the 143d section, which empowers the committee to compel any person, not a legal voter, who voted at the election in question, to declare under oath for which candidate he voted. This was a new and extraordinary power, and, being conferred on a legislalative committee, the statute meant, by the reference, to confer the same power on Courts of Quarter Sessions when sitting in contested elections.</p>

A bill of exceptions compels the facts upon the record. Neither the court nor the adverse party can resist it, but the parties cannot be compelled to agree, nor the court to admit their agreement to record. Still both may be done, and thus the purpose of a bill of exceptions fully attained. The agreed facts become, in such a case, as real a part of the record as if a special verdict had been received and recorded. The court to whom the legislature committed this contested election is provided with a jury which might be used to ascertain facts, and a special verdict is as much legal ground for judgment in the Quarter Sessions as in the Common Pleas.

And so understood, there was nothing in the State Constitution, when the Act of 1818 was passed, which its terms could be thought to contravene. The Constitution of 1790 was then in force, and the qualifications of an elector which that instrument prescribed, were that he should be a freeman of the age of twenty-one years; that he should have resided in the state two years next before the election, and within that time paid a state or county tax, which should have been assessed at least six months before the election — or he should be a son, between twenty-one and twenty-two years of age, of a citizen qualified as aforesaid. This was the constitutional rule, and the whole of it, up to January 1st 1839, when the amended Constitution of 1838 took effect; and, therefore, when the revisers of'our civil code, who were very competent constitutional lawyers, reported in 1834 a general election law, substantially the same that is now in force, they did not hesitate to retain the substance of the Act of 1813. Had their report been made after the Constitution of 1838, we would scarcely have expected them to incorporate the provisions of the Act of 1813, for, as we shall see hereafter, the Constitution of 1838 made the precise place of voting an element of suffrage.</p>

We are not to wonder at this, for instances of even more careless legislation are not uncommon.

If, in the hurry of closing a long session of the legislature, any one of the numerous provisions of the act suggested a constitutional doubt to the mind of a single member, he doubtless dismissed it upon faith in the revisers, without remembering that he was called to consider a very different constitutional question from any that engaged their attention.

The idea of a registry of legal voters a.s means to purity of elections was hinted by Ch. J. Tilghman in 1816, in Catlin <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 S. &amp; R. 266. When the third article came up in the Convention of 1838, the political party who had favoured the Philadelphia registry law brought forward and supported this amendment as calculated to accomplish substantially the same results for the whole state which the registry law proposed to accomplish for Philadelphia. The political party to whom the registry law had always been distasteful, opposed the amendment as an unnecessary clog upon freedom of suffrage, but on a division it was adopted by a vote of sixty-four to sixty, every member from the city of Philadelphia, where the registry law had proved acceptable, voting for it, and <a id="p419" href="#p419" data-label="419" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*419</a>every member from the county of Philadelphia, which had never relished the registry law, voting against the amendment: Con.

Construing the words according to their plain and literal import (and we must presume that the people of Pennsylvania construed them so when they adopted the amendment), they mean, undoubtedly, that the citizen, possessing the other requisite qualifications, is to have a ten days’ residence in an election district, and is to offer his ballot in that district. The second section of this article requires all popular elections to be by ballot. To “ offer to vote” by ballot, is to present oneself, with proper qualifications, at the time and place appointed, and to make manual delivery of the ballot to the officers appointed by law to receive it. jThe ballot cannot be sent by mail or express, nor can it be cast outside of all Pennsylvania election districts and certified into the county where the voter has his domicil. We cannot be persuaded that the constitution ever contemplated any such mode of voting, and we have abundant reason for thinking that to permit it would break down all the safeguards of honest suffrage. The constitution meant, rather, that the voter, <em>in propria </em>persona, should offer his vote in an appropriate election district, in order that his neighbours might be at hand to establish his right to vote if it were challenged, or to challenge if it were doubtful.</p>

The words “election district,” do not occur in the Constitution of 1790. The word “ district” was often applied by that instrument to subdivisions of the state for senatorial, representative, and judicial purposes, but never for purposes of general elections. Election districts acquired their first constitutional recognition in 1838. They had, however, long been familiar to our ordinary legislation. “ When any township or townships hath or have been divided, or hereafter shall be divided, in forming any <em>election </em>district, an inspector shall be chosen for each dis<a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>triet,” said the 7th section of the Act of 15th February 1799 (8 Smith’s Laws 340), and since that time we have had innumerable Acts of Assembly creating, dividing, and subdividing election districts, until the legislature grew tired of the subject, and, in 1854, turned it over to the Courts of Quarter Sessions, to fix election districts, “so as to suit the convenience of the inhabitants thereofPurd. 1069. Always, from 1799 down to the present hour, election districts, within the meaning of our statutes, have denoted subdivisions of Pennsylvania territory, marked out by known boundaries, prearranged and declared by public authority. Whether composed, as at different periods they have been, of counties, or cities, or townships, or boroughs, of wards or of precincts, they have always been such subdivisions of our own territory, and no man has ever been known to suggest the formation of an election district by Pennsylvania authority outside of her state borders. Now, whilst the constitution did not stop to define election districts, it took up and incorporated them as the legislature had theretofore or should thereafter define and regulate them. It referred itself to the legislative will on the subject. And, therefore, election districts mean in the constitution just what they mean in the statutes. This necessary dependence of constitutional principles upon auxiliary legislation was explained in Maxwell’s Case, 3 Casey 444. We must understand the constitution, then, as prescribing to the qualified voter, that his ballot is to be cast in such an election district as the legislature may erect by itself or through the courts. And the legislative power over election districts is unlimited within our own state. Whether they could form a district <em>beyond </em>our territorial jurisdiction for the convenience of our own citizens, is a question which need not be considered, for no such legislation has been attempted. But it is quite clear to our minds that the legislature might erect a military camp within tbe state into an election district, and the moment they should do so the constitution would apply itself to that district in the same manner as to any other.</p>

This is a part of the condition of suffrage. Undoubtedly the primary signification of the word “residence,” as used in the constitution, is the same as domicil — a word which means the place where a man establishes his abode, makes the seat of his property, and exercises his civil and political rights, but I am not satisfied that the constitution meant to limit itself to this strict and technical definition of residence. Referring the subject of election districts to the legislature, as we have seen that it did, I incline strongly to think that the constitution meant, also, to leave the subject of residence in an election district to legislative discretion, and, therefore, that the legislature are as free to declare <a id="p421" href="#p421" data-label="421" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*421</a>what shall be residence in an election district for ten days next preceding the election, as they are to prescribe the boundaries of the district. When they have not exercised their power nor attached to the word any other than its ordinary legal signification, it is to be received according to its primary meaning in the constitution, as equivalent to domicil. But if they should make a military camp in- Pennsylvania an election district, and declare that military sojourn and service therein for ten days should be equivalent to a constitutional residence for the purposes of election, I would be extremely loth to think such a law unconstitutional.

The 43d section does not affect to create an election district. There is not a word in it for that purpose. There is no designation of boundaries, no subdivision of territory, nothing, not a word or thought which bears the slightest relation to our legislation on the subject of election districts. But it is said the place which the commanding officer is authorized to appoint is the substantial equivalent of an election district. Not so for many reasons, for these two particularly: 1st. There is no prior public designation of the place. One purpose of having election districts designated on some public record is, that all parties interested may know where to resort to find the ballot-box. Some go there to vote — - others to watch for illegal votes — others to electioneer, but all <a id="p422" href="#p422" data-label="422" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*422</a>have an interest in knowing where the law of the land has directed the election to be held. The military commander makes no public proclamation of the place he appoints, no record exists of his appointment. 2d. A second and perfectly conclusive reason why the place fixed by the commander cannot be regarded as an election district is, that the legislature have no power to authorize a military commander to make an election district. It is a part of the civil administration — this designating of election districts — and however it may be committed by one of the three co-ordinate departments of the government to another of those departments, as by the legislature to the judiciary, no civil functions of either department can be delegated to a military commander. This would be to confound the first principles of the government. If the legislature had said in the most express terms that the commander might declare his camp, wherever it might happen to be, an election district, it could have availed nothing, for the constitution, in referring to the legislature for election districts, recognised them as among the <em>oivil </em>institutions of the state, to be created and controlled exclusively by the civil, as contradistinguished from the military power of the state. The constitution says “the military shall, in all cases and at all times, be in strict subordination to the civil power,” which is marking a distinction between the two powers with great emphasis. To the civil and not to the military power did the constitution intrust the formation of election districts, and therefore the civil cannot commit it to the military.</p>

Without an election district there can be no constitutional voting. The.43d section provides for no election district, and no military commander can be empowered to form one — hence it follows, as an inevitable deduction, that the “ place” referred to in that section is inconsistent with the constitutional requisition of an election district, and that whatever votes have been cast in pursuance of that section since the Constitution of 1838 came in, have been cast without authority of law. If the place of voting has been, as in many instances we know it has been in other states, and in the District of Columbia, the assumptions set up in behalf of it have only been the more extravagant. For, observe, it has first been assumed that the constitution was intended to have extraterritorial effect; next, that the legislature had power to make election laws to be executed not only in Pennsylvania, but in other states; then that the 43d section established election districts wherever a commander of a troop or company should be pleased to appoint; and finally, that the presence of the soldier-voter at that place— though it might be on a forced march or in the tug of battle — was <a id="p423" href="#p423" data-label="423" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*423</a>
      <em>residence </em>for ten days within the meaning of the constitution, no word of legislation having ever said it should be so considered. Nay, not only had no legislation authorized this last assumption, but this very 43d section had excluded it by declaring that the soldiers entitled to vote at the places appointed by military commanders should be “ <em>qualified citizens.”</em>

This word “ hereinbefore” is a reference to prior sections of the same statute, but the qualifications for suffrage-are not contained in any prior section— another instance of careless legislation. It is not till we get to the 63d section that we come to the subject of qualifications. The 63d section re-enacts the 1st section of the third article of the constitution in terms. If we read the word hereinbefore as if it were written hereinafter, or if we construe it as referring to the consti tutional clause of qualification (and in one or the other of these ways it must be taken), it comes to the same <em>thing </em>— a <em>demand for the constitutional qualifications of suffrage in every soldier who claims to vote under the </em>43&lt;7 <em>section. </em>It says, in effect, that the soldiers who offer to vote in the election district wherein they have resided ten days immediately preceding the election, shall be entitled to vote in any place their commander appoints, provided it be not within ten miles of the district wherein they have resided for the last ten days — which is downright nonsense.

The learned judge refers himself to several cases, in which this court have set up judicial implications as to the spirit and meaning of the constitution, in order to support Acts of Assembly that were inconsistent with the letter of the constitution, but he failed to observe that, in all these cases, there was <em>ground laid in the constitution itself </em>to support the judicial implication. Take for example the Acts of Assembly that were discussed in Zephon’s Case, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0068-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 68" data-case-ids="481756" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0068-01">7 W. &amp; S. 68</a>, Kilpatrick’s Case, 7 Casey 178, and Foust’s Case, 9 Id. 340, all of which were supposed to conflict with that provision of the constitution which requires the president judge of the Common Pleas to be one of the quorum of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. Everybody knows that the constitution betrayed an anxiety that the trial of high crimes should be presided over by a judge “ learned in the law,” and as it provided for no such judges, except in the instance of the president of the Common Pleas, it, therefore, required <em>him </em>to be present in the court of highest criminal jurisdiction. But when the legislature provided associate judges “learned in the law,” for certain Courts of Common Pleas, <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>everybody saw how the overruling purpose of the constitution would be just as well carried out by allowing such associates to constitute the Oyer and Terminer, as by requiring the president judge to be always present.

The legislature, considering that three months was none too much time for the people to look up a good judge, provided that if a vacancy occurred in less than that time before the annual general election, the choice should be postponed till the general election of the next year — the vacancy being filled, meantime, by executive appointment. We held the Act of Assembly constitutional, because it aimed at the accomplishment of one of the great and apparent purposes of the constitution. We could not consider the interval of three months unreasonable, because it was the very period which the constitution itself fixed, for the election of a governor when a vacancy happened in that office in the midst of an official term.

It does not deal with suffrage carelessly. It withholds it altogether from about four-fifths of the population, however much property they may have to he taxed, or however competent in respect of prudence and patriotism, many of them may be to vote. And here let it be remarked, that all our successive constitutions have grown more and more astute on this subject. Penn’s frame of government, made in April 1682, gave the right of suffrage to “ every freeman of the province;” his law's, agreed upon in England in May 1682, gave it to every inhabitant of the province who should purchase a hundred acres of land, or who shall have paid his passage, and taken up a hundred acres of land at a penny an acre, and cultivated ten acres thereof; and to every person that hath been a servant or bondsman, and is free by his service, that shall have taken up fifty acres, and cultivated twenty, and to every resi<a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>■dent of the province that pays scot and lot to the government.

Now the labour of the Constitution has not been to restrict suffrage in any spirit of distrust of popular intelligence, but it has been to define it so exactly that it might be preserved from abuse and perversion. The constitution affords ample ground for judicial implications in favour of legislation that tends to ascertain legal voters and votes with precision and exactitude, but not an atom of ground for implications in behalf of a law that opens the ballot-box anywhere and everywhere, under supervision of military officers wholly unknown to our civil administration, and where no officer can possibly be who is specially charged with the supervision of state elections.

Have they a right to charge the constitution with disfranchising them ? Is not'the truth rather this — that they have voluntarily assumed duties that are inconsistent with the right of suffrage for the time being ? Such is our case, and such is the case of the volunteers in the army. The right of suffrage is carefully preserved for both them and us, to be enjoyed when we return to the places which the constitution has appointed for its exercise. It is forcing a gratuitous assumption upon the constitution to treat it as intending that the volunteer in the public service, shall carry his elective franchise with him wherever his duties require him to go. There is no word or syllable in the instrument to justify the assumption.</p>

As a court of justice we cannot feel the force of any such consideration. Our business is to expound the constitution and laws of the country as we find them written. We have no bounties to grant to soldiers, or anybody else. It may be said, however, in answer to this suggestion, that the hardship of missing an annual election is one of the least the soldier is called on to endure, and this they share in common with the patriot soldiers of all the loyal states, for it is understood that no state but Pennsylvania has attempted to extend civiUsuffrage to an army in <em>the </em>field. To voluntarily surrender the comforts of home, and friends, and business, and to encounter the privations of the camp and the perils of war, for the purpose of vindicating the constitution and laws of the country, is indeed a signal sacrifice to make for the public good, but the men who make it most cheerfully and from the highest motives, would be the very last to insist on carrying with them the right of civil suffrage, especially when they see, what experience proves, that it cannot be exercised amidst the tumults of war without being attended with fraudulent practices that endanger the very <em>existence </em>of the right. Whilst such men fight for the constitution, they do not expect judges to sap and mine it by judicial constructions.</p>
    <p id="b430-6" data-blocks='[["BL_430.6",430,[280,1309,1162,716]]]'>Finally, let it be said that we do not look upon the construction we have given the constitutional amendment as stringent, harsh, or technical. On the contrary, we consider it the natural and obvious reading of the instrument, such as the million would instinctively adopt. Constitutions, above all other documents, are to be read as they are written. Judicial glosses and refinements are misplaced when laid upon them. Carefully considered judicial implications may indeed be made from them in support of statutes — never to defeat statutes — when such implications are grounded in the constitution itself, and' tend to accomplish its obvious purposes, as well as to promote the public welfare. But when asked to set up a construction that opposes itself to both the letter and the spirit of the instrument, and which tends to the destruction of one of our fundamental political rights — that free and honest suffrage on which all our institutions are built — this court must' say, in fidelity to the oaths we swore, that it cannot be done.</p>
