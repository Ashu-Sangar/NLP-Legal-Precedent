The counsel for Miss May, however, did not urge that the share of Samuel S. Neide lapsed, and therefore, being part of the residue, it was to be distributed amongst the testator’s next of kin, as undisposed estate. But he claimed, that under the words of the residuary clause, Samuel’s share would survive to the other grandchildren of the testator. It was not alleged that the gift was joint, and, therefore, survived by the <em>jus aeerescendi; </em>but the claim was put upon the ground, that the gift of the residue was to a class, and therefore, those, and those only, who belonged to that class at the time of the distribution, were entitled to take.</p>

No authority has been cited for this, except those which establish the general position that the survivors of a class take, in case of the death of any before the time of distribution, nor has any principle been suggested on which to base such distinction. The authorities, however, lead to a different conclusion, which, it will be seen, is founded on reason.

Thus, before a distribution among survivors can take place, both the father and mother must be dead. A grandchild was living when the will was made, and died leaving to survive him his mother, who continued to live to the period of distribution, and is living yet. She is the person designated by the will to take, in place of her dead child. Is there any inflexible rule of law which will override and trample down this plain intent ?

Wms. 113; Walker <em>v. </em>Main, 1 Ja. &amp; Walker 1; Humbustone <em>v. </em>Staunton, 1 Ves. &amp; B. 388. This principle applies to legacies given to tenants in common, with a limitation over, as to other oases: 2 Roper on Leg., ch. 8, § 5, p. 488. There is no case which decides that where the gift is to a class, with a limitation over, in the event of the death of the legatee before twenty-one, the limitation shall not take effect if the legatee dies in the testator’s lifetime. The limitation rests on the intention of the testator, and is made effectual in order to answer that intention. Is there any reason why such intention should not be regarded in the construction of a gift to a class, as well as to tenants in common by name ? None has been given, and none is perceived. The legacy is to go over if the legatee dies before twenty-one, and no distinction is made between dying before and dying after the testator. If the testator has made no distinction in this respect, how shall the court make any ? He has chosen to substitute the mother for the child in a certain event, which has happened; why should the court say that that event must be after a period not mentioned by the testator, .in order to give effect to the substitution ? In Cort <em>v. </em>Winder the gift over, though the legacy was to a class, was held good, because it was competent for the testator to make such a gift, and it was not deemed right to manufacture any new -rule of law, or misapply an old one to defeat it. The limitation stood upon the express provisions of the will there, as it does in all these cases of the death of the legatee in the testator’s lifetime; and the case of a gift to a class, which Cort <em>v. </em>Winder was, is not made an exception. The authorities cited by the auditor sustain him, and so do the well-understood principles of law also. Cort <em>v. </em>Winder, 1 Collyer 321, is, in all essential particulars, the same as the case in hand, and decides two points: — 1. When a gift is to a class, with a limitation over, and the legatee dies before the day of payment, in the lifetime of the testator, the limitation takes effect. 2.

It answers beside, by anticipation, one of the appellant’s arguments. The lord chancellor does indeed say, <em>arguendo, </em>in Wordsworth <em>v. </em>Wood, “substitution assumes that the party dying was an object of the gift.” That idea he derives from Thornhill <em>v. </em>Thornhill, 4 Madd. 377, which case, the vice-chancellor says, in Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, “is wrong.” In Gray <em>v. </em>Garmon, 2 Hare 271, it was further considered, and it was said: — “ It has been made a question, whether the capacity of a primary legatee (at the date of the will), to take the legacy was alone sufficient; whether such legatee must not survive the testator, become a legatee in <em>esse, </em>and not have been a legatee in <em>posse, </em>only to entitle his issue to claim by substitution: Thornhill <em>v. </em>Thornhill. But later cases appear to sanction a more liberal, though still a literal construction of language like that I am considering, and it has been held, that the issue of a person primarily pointed out, as the object of the testator’s bounty, and living at the date of the will, may take, by substitution, for that party dying in the lifetime of the testator: Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, 8 Simons 353; Collins <em>v. </em>Johnson, <a href="/binn/5/0601-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 Binn. 601" data-case-ids="1793643" data-case-paths="/binn/5/0601-01">Id.</a> 326 n.; Le Jeune <em>v. </em>Le Jeune, 2 Keene 701. The doctrine of substitution is considered in Mowatt <em>v. </em>Carron, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Paige%20Ch.%20377" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="7 Paige Ch. 377">7 Paige 377</a>, with reference to Leadsome <em>v. </em>Hickman, 2 Vern. 611; Bird <em>v. </em>Lockey, 2 Id. 744; Willing <em>v. </em>Baine, 2 P. Wms. 113. The principle that the legacy to the substituted legatees, does not lapse by the death in the lifetime of the testator of the legatee, in whose place they are substituted by the will, is also fully recognised in several recent decisions in the Court of Chancery, in England: 1 Rus. &amp; Myl. 639; 2 Myl. &amp; K. 69; 3 Keene 701; 1 C. P. Cooper’s Rep. 172. Le Jeune <em>v. </em>Le Jeune, 2 Keene 701, is not only an authority on the doctrine of substitution, but on the main point. There was a gift to a class, as in Oort <em>v. </em>Winder, Willing <em>v. </em>Baine, and Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, and the same conclusion was reached. The death of one of the class occurred prior to the period of distribution, and in the testator’s lifetime; and it appearing to the court, that the intention of the testator was, to substitute a legacy to one of a class dying prior to the period of distribution, the substituted legatee took the share that the first legatee would have taken had he lived. The only question entertained in any of the cases was as to the intention of the testator. It is nowhere suggested, that the intention, in such cases, is to give way to any artificial rule of construction. On <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>the contrary, the great, leading, primary rule, in the interpretation of wills, that the intention of the testator shall govern, is, in all of them, constantly appealed to, and steadily applied. No-reason has been given, for the decision of this case on a different principle; and the intention of Judge Shaffer being manifest, that if Samuel J. Neide should die within the period between the testator’s death and the arrival of his grandchild at twenty-one, his mother, if living, should have his share, the report of the auditor and the judgment of 'the Orphans’ Court are right.</p>

It is conceded that if a legacy be given to one by name, and in the event of his death to another, the alternative gift will take effect, if the first legatee die even in the testator’s lifetime. But it is argued that this rule is not applicable to legacies to a class, the constituents of which cannot be ascertained until the death of the testator, or <em>some </em>subsequent period. It is said that Samuel J. Neide, who died in the lifetime of his grandfather, was no legatee, and therefore that he had no share to go over to his mother in case of his death. It is true he never became a legatee <em>in esse, </em>but he was a possible one, and would have been entitled to a share if he had survived the testator, and obtained the age of twenty-one years. There is, undoubtedly, considerable reason for distinguishing between substitutionary legacies after an immediate gift to individuals <em>nominatim, </em>and such legacies after a gift to a class. But the cases seem to hold, that even when a legacy is given to a class, and, in the event of the death of one who would have been a constituent of the class, before a-defined period, his share over to another, that other will take though the first legatee die in the lifetime of the testator. In other words, the alternative gift will be supported, if the first legatee be one who would have taken had he lived to the period of distribution. Such is the doctrine of Cort <em>v. </em>Winder, 1 Collyer 321. There the bequest was to the testator’s first cousins germain, share and share alike, as a class. It was then added, “ and in case any of my said cousins shall depart this life before their respective share of the residue of my moneys and personal estate shall become due or payable, leaving any lawful issue him or them surviving, I direct that such issue shall have and be entitled to the same share or shares of the same residue and moneys as his, her, or their parent or parents would have been entitled to if living.” One of the cousins died after the date of the will, and before the testator, leaving issue. It was held’that the issue took what would have been the share of the deceased cousin, had he lived. It might indeed be said of this case, that the legacies to the first cousins germain vested in <a id="p523" href="#p523" data-label="523" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*523</a>the persons included in the class at the death of the testator. The contingency of the death of any one, so as to let in his issue, must have happened, if at all, in his lifetime; and it must have been that he intended to speak of death before the will should take effect. There was no other to which tho death of the first legatee could be referred. The case was, however, not ruled upon this ground. And in Smith <em>v. </em>Smith, 8 Simons 353, wre have a case in which there was a period after the decease of the testator, to which the contingency of the death of tho first possible legatee might have been referred. There the testator gave his residuary estate in trust to his wife for life, and, after her death, to his children <em>then </em>living, to be paid to them as they arrived at the age of twenty-one years, provided that if any of his children who should happen to die in the lifetime of his wife, should have left issue, such issue should take the share to w'hich the parent would have been entitled if living. There were eight children living at the date of the will, seven of whom, with the ■wife, survived the testator. One child died before him, leaving issue. Here was a gift-to a class indeterminate until the death of the widow, and a period after the decease of the testator, to which the contingency of the death of any child might have been referred; yet it was held that the legacy to the issue of the child who died in the lifetime of the testator took effect. It was argued that the issue of a child were not objects of the original gift, but were intended to take by way of substitution for their parent, and consequently that the issue of a child could not take unless there was a possibility of the parents taking; that, as the father of the issue died in the testator’s lifetime, he never had any possibility of taking, and therefore his issue was not entitled. This is the argument which has been urged upon us. But the vice-chancellor said that the testator meant, if a child died and left issue, the issue should take, though the child could not, and he ruled that the event which had happened, to wit, death of a child within the testator’s lifetime, was within both the general meaning and the words of the will.</p>
    <p id="b525-6" data-blocks='[["BL_525.6",525,[201,1910,1165,516]],["BL_526.1",526,[286,411,1167,1143]]]'>The cases of Willing <em>v. </em>Baine, 3 Peere Williams 113, and Le Jeune <em>v. </em>Le Jeune, 2 Keene 701, as we understand them, are to the same effect. The legacies were to a class, and a bequest over in the event of the death of one who would have belonged to the class, had he lived until the time fixed for ascertaining its constituents, was held to take effect though the death happened before the testator’s decease. Upon this subject the authorities appear to be almost uniform. Indeed, but one is known to exist, and that is a very old one, which asserts the contrary doctrine. In Gray <em>v. </em>Garman, 2 Hare 268, the question was under a will bequeathing to brothers and sisters as a class, with a direction, that the issue of any of them that should be dead at the time of <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>distribution should stand in the place of their respective parents, and it was ruled, that the issue of a brother who had died before the will was made could not take, either by substitution, or as original and substantive legatees. That was not a case like this, but the language of the vice-chancellor, Sir Lancelot Shadwell, in delivering his opinion, is pertinent. He said, “it has been made a question, whether the capacity of the primary legatee (at the date of the will) to take the legacy was alone sufficient; whether such legatee must not survive the testator and become a legatee <em>in esse, </em>and not have been a legatee <em>in posse </em>only to entitle his issue to claim in substitution. But later cases appear to sanction a more liberal, though still a literal construction of language like that 1 am considering; and it has been held, that the issue of a person primarily pointed out as the object of a testator’s bounty, and being at the date of the will, may take by substitution for that party dying in the lifetime of the testator.” The vice-chancellor must be understood as speaking of a case where the “person primarily pointed out,” was designated not by name, but by a class, to which he would'belong if he continued to live, for such was the ease which he had before him, and it has not been doubted, that the legacy by substitution is good when the primary legatee is named. It may be that substitution assumes that the party dying was an object of the gift; but the limitation over to Mrs. Neide may be properly called an alternative one, a gift upon a double contingency, neither of which involves necessarily the existence of any other person who could take.</p>
