In Guthrie’s Appeal and Chew’s Appeal, the objects of the testator’s bounty were <em>in esse </em>at the time of the execution of the will, and of the testator’s death; and the word <em>children </em>was accordingly held to be a Avord designatory of <em>persons </em>of the individuals Avho were to take under the will. Let it be conceded that the word children is to be construed as a Avord of purchase, Avhen individuals answering the description are in being.. It is, however, Avell settled, that the word <em>children may </em>be a <em>nomen collectivum, </em>signifying “ heirs of the body.” So much is admitted in Guthrie’s Appeal.' It is further settled, that the word children is to be thus construed as a word of limitation, when there is no one in being to whom the testator could have intended to refer: Wild’s. Case, 6 Reports 17. In Powell on Devises, where this question is discussed, the folloAving conclusion is given: “ Thus the cases have established, beyond contradiction, that a devise to a man and his children, he having none at the time of his demise, gives him an estate tail.” See Burton on Real Property, 23 Law Lib. 96. To the same effect is Gernet <em>v. </em>Lynn, 7 Casey 99.</p>
    <p id="b248-7" data-blocks='[["BL_248.7",248,[302,1521,1164,898]],["BL_249.1",249,[199,422,1168,87]]]'>Stress may, perhaps, be laid on the form of expression used in the devise, “and <em>at </em>and immediately <em>after </em>her decease, I devise and bequeath the same to her children, if any, in fee, &amp;c.” It is true, that in some of the older cases, a distinction is recognised, in construing the word children, between a devise to a man and his children, and one to a man and, <em>after </em>his death, to his children. But the distinction is not a solid one, and is not sustained by more recent cases. For let it once be conceded that the word children may, in some connections, be construed as a Avord of limitation, and that the case of the non-existence of children at the time of the devise is such a case, and there Avould be no reason for distinguishing, in construction, between the Avord “children” and the words “issue of the body.” The books are full of cases in which a devise to a man for life, and, after his death, to his issue, or to the heirs of his body, is construed as giving the first taker an estate tail. In the words of Powell, “ equally inoperative to affect the construction” are the words, “immediately after his decease,” in the devise over. Even assuming that they would authorize the construing the devise over, as dependent on the event of the first taker leaving no issue living at his decease, which it Avould be difficult to sustain, this would not affect the <a id="p247" href="#p247" data-label="247" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*247</a>antecedent estate tail, in connection, indeed, with which, the words •are scarcely entitled to any observation.”</p>
    <p id="b249-6" data-blocks='[["BL_249.6",249,[207,508,1160,261]]]'>No good reason can be given why a destructive effect should be given to the words “ after her decease,” in the case where the devise over is to children, used as a <em>nomen collectivum, </em>when such effect is refused in the case of a devise over to issue or heirs of the body. Nor do the later authorities demand such a distinction: Hodges <em>v. </em>Middleton, Douglas 431; Gernet <em>v. </em>Lynn, 7 Casey 94.</p>
    <p id="b249-7" data-blocks='[["BL_249.7",249,[207,767,1162,775]]]'>The construction put upon the devise by the court below will work a hardship, and may defeat the intention of the testator. From the whole tenor of the will, the chief object of the testator was to provide for his children and their offspring. But if Mrs. Cote’s estate be held an estate for life, then the remainder to her children must he construed <em>contingent </em>on their surviving their mother. And this involves several difficulties. There is no <em>vested </em>remainder created, and the inheritance is in abeyance. There is no estate created to preserve the contingent remainder. To be sure, if one or more children had been <em>in esse </em>when the devise took effect, the remainder would have vested in them, and opened to let in after-born children. But such was not the case. Under this construction, moreover, if the children of Mrs. Cote should die before her, leaving issue, such issue would not inherit, which cannot be supposed to have been the testator’s intention. The hardship involved in this construction is a relevant argument against it: Jordan <em>v. </em>Adams, Exchequer Chamber, February 8th 1861; Leg. Int., October 4th 1861.</p>

But be it observed that, undoubtedly and consistently with the foregoing argument, two of the other devisees, who had children living at the date of the will and death of the testator, were tenants for life; and the clause referred to is satisfied by that fact. Nor would the use of such a term, even if referring to Mrs. Cote, destroy or impair the precedent estate tail.</p>

That the principal case does not come within the “ much talked of rule in Shelly’s Case” proper, or of its congeners, which exists only where the word “heirs” is used by the testator, although there is 'a class of cases where other words may be brought within the rule, if such he the intention of the testator. Where the word “heirs” is used there is a presumption in law that the case is within the rule, which is more or less strengthened by other expressions in the will, either closely connected with the clause containing the word “heirs,” or in other parts <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>of the will, yet in their absence the presumption is of course to be adhered to. But where the word “ children” is used the presumption is, that it is a word of purchase. No attempt is made to oppugn the doctrine that the rule in Shelly’s Case is well settled law in Pennsylvania. Without wading through the mass of cases on the subject, we rely especially on Guthrie’s Appeal, <a href="/wright/1/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Wright 9" data-case-ids="626208" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0009-01">1 Wright 9</a>, and Chew’s Appeal, 1 <a href="/wright/1/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Wright 9" data-case-ids="626208" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0009-01">Id. 28</a>, decided since the ruling of McKee <em>v. </em>McKinley, 9 Casey 92, Williams <em>v. </em>Leech, 4 Casey 89, and Nagle’s Appeal, 9 Casey 89, cited by the counsel for the complainants in the court below, but not relied upon by him here, and indeed not to be reconciled with the opinions held in Guthrie’s and Chew’s cases. In this case neither the words “heirs of the body” nor “issue,” which in Guthrie’s Appeal were held equivalent to “children,” when used to describe the same object; are used by the testator.</p>

An attempt is made to distinguish this case from Guthrie’s Appeal, on account of the fact that “at the time when that will was made Elizabeth Bones had several children, and all her children were born before the will was proved, and probably before the death of the testator;” whereas, in our case, Mrs. Cote (then Tiernan) had no children when George Miltenberger’s will was made.</p>

This we resist. It is not necessary to the vesting of the contingent remainder in Mrs. Cote’s children, that any one of them should be living at the time of making the will, or at the death of the testator. If any one of such children had been living when Mr. Miltenberger died, the contingent remainder would be vested in that child, subject to be opened to let in any after-born children. But although Mrs. Cote had no child until after her father’s death, the contingent remainder either vested on the birth of that child, or will vest upon such child’s surviving its mother, if that be construed to be the contingency contemplated by its grandfather. See Williams and Wife <em>v. </em>Leech <em>et al., </em>4 Casey 98. If the case before the court be construed to be an executory devise, no particular estate is necessary to support it. But the presumption is, that it is a contingent remainder, and we so regard it. Then is it indispensable that a fee simple should precede such remainder in order that it may be valid ? We answer, no; a vested freehold is sufficient: 4 Kent’s Com. 236. Now, a life estate in Mrs. Cote is a vested freehold.

They would be children of Mrs. Cote’s children, not <em>in esse </em>either at the time of the testator’s death or at the death of Mrs. Cote. If this be so, no argument of an intention in the testator, adverse to a life estate, can be drawn from his not directing that which the' law would not carry into effect. It is to be noted, also, that while the testator, in his devises to his other daughters, expressly provides that the offspring of such daughter’s children as may be deceased at the time of his said daughter’s death, should represent their deceased parents. In his. devise to his daughter, Mrs. Cote, he makes no provision for <em>her </em>grandchildren whatever, thus negativing the idea of it being his intention that they should inherit in the event of their parents dying before their mother, Mrs. Cote.</p>

But the inquiry is needless in this case. The will of George Miltenberger gave to Mrs. Cote, the complainant, no more than an estate for life, and there was therefore neither a mistake of fact nor of law. The testator first made provision for his widow, and then directed all the rest and residue of his estate to be divided into nine equal shares or parts. After having given to each of his other daughters an estate for and during her natural life in one of these shares, he devised to Mrs. Cote, the complainant, in the words following: “one other equal ninth part or share of my estate, I devise and bequeath to my daughter, Mary Tiernan (now Mary Cote), to have and hold to her for and during the term of her natural life, and at and immediately after her decease, I devise and bequeath the same to her children, if <a id="p251" href="#p251" data-label="251" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*251</a>any, in fee; but if sbe should die without leaving children, then to her brothers and sisters, their heirs and assigns for ever.”</p>

That such is the general rule is beyond doubt, and it is not denied by the complainants. But it is insisted that because the devisee in this ease was without children at' the time when the will was made and when it took effect by the death of the testator, her case is not within the general rule, and that she took an estate tail. In taking this position the complainants overlook the fact that the devise to the children of Mrs. Cote was not in terms immediate, and that the testator did not intend for them any present enjoyment. The devise to the children was a gift in remainder. Every reason therefore fails for treating the word “ children” as a word of limitation. In Wild’s Case, 6 Coke’s Rep. 16 v and 17 a &amp; b, it was resolved that if A. .devises his lands to B. and to his children or issues, and he hath not any issue at the time of the devise, the same is an estate tail. The reason given for this resolution was “ that the intent of the devisor is manifest and certain that his (B.’s) children or issues should take, and as immediate devisees they cannot take, because they are not <em>in rerum natura, </em>and by way of remainder they cannot take, for that was not his intent, for the gift is immediate; therefore such words shall be taken as words of limitation, <em>soil, </em>as much as children or issues of his body.” Such was also the ruling in Davie <em>v. </em>Stevens, Doug. 321; and other similar decisions have been made. But the reason ceases entirely when the gift to the children instead of being immediate is by way of remainder. In such a case the word “ children” may have its natural signification, consistently with the entire intent of the testator, and therefore it was also resolved in Wild’s Case, “that if a man devises land to husband and wife, and after their decease to their children, or the remainder to their children, although they have not any child at the time, yet every child which they shall have after may take by way of remainder, according to the rule of the law, for his intent appears that the children shall not take immediately, but after the decease of (Rowland and his wife”) the first takers. When a remainder is limited to children, and it can take effect as such, it must, and consequently the word cannot be a word of limitation, and enlarge the estate limited to the parent for life into an estate tail. In 1 Ball &amp; Beatty 459, Downes, C. J., well stated the doctrine of Wild’s Case and the decisions founded upon it, as establishing these propositions. “ When the devise is in terms immediate, and so intended by the testator, and the description of the persons to take is general, then none that do not fall within the description at the time of the testator’s death, <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>can take; therefore the afterborn must be excluded. But where the enjoyment of the thing devised is by the testator’s expressed intent not to be immediate by those among whom it is finally to be divided, but is postponed to a particular period, or until a particular event shall happen, then those who answer the general description at the period or when the event happens on which the distribution is to be made, are entitled to take.” The distinction noticed is an obvious and well recognised one; so obvious that Mr. Powell, in his treatise on Devises, Vol. 2, p. 495, note q, remarks that “where a limitation is to a parent for life, and to his children by way of remainder, there seems to be no ground, whether there are children or not, for holding the parent to be tenant in tail. It is true that in Hodges <em>v. </em>Middleton, Doug. 431, Lord Mansfield and the King’s Bench inclined to think that when a testatrix devised to A. for life, and after her death to her children, charged with the payment of an annuity, with remainder over on failure of children, A. took an estate tail, but if not, her children did. This case is doubted by Mr. Powell, and it is not in point, for the devisee for life had seven children living at the death of the testatrix.</p>

The bond and mortgage which she seeks to have cancelled were not given in mistake. Her bill was consequently without any foundation upon which to stand, and it was properly dismissed by the District Court.</p>
