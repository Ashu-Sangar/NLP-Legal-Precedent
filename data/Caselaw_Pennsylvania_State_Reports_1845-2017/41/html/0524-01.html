    <p class="summary" id="b529-10" data-blocks='[["BL_529.10",529,[177,1003,1163,1459]]]'>“Securities given by a principal debtor, as an indemnity against the debt, to those who have become jointly bound with him as sureties for its payment, have sometimes been said to be trusts for the creditor. If this were so, it would follow that they could not be returned to the principal, without applying to the creditor, and obtaining his consent to the surrender; a conclusion so extreme as to show that the principle which leads to it must be an error. But while such securities are not in any just sense of the word trusts, unless made so expressly, they are, notwithstanding, charged with duties and obligations which may render it necessary to award them to the creditor, as the only means of doing justice between the principal and the surety. For although the surety may, under ordinary circumstances, consent that they shall be applied to other debts of the principal, instead of that which they were meant to secure, or the principal release all claim upon them in favour of the surety, without giving any just ground of complaint to the creditor; this is true only so long as the parties are solvent, and the securities remain in the hands of the parties, and subject to their disposition, and ceases to be so when they are turned into a fund for the payment of debts by an assignment or execution. The duty of appropriating them then devolves on the law, which will act with due regard to the claims both of the principal and the surety, and not suffer the fund to be diverted from the debt, in which they have a common interest, to any collateral purpose. To borrow an illustration from mechanics — the ease is, then, that of a body impelled by two forces, which cannot pursue the direction of either without conflict with the other, and must therefore move in that of their resultant, which will conduct it directly to the pocket of the creditor. This will be apparent on referring to the decision of Judge Cadwalader, in the case of Winter <em>v. </em>Ludlow, where the cases are examined and methodized with a fulness and precision which will leave the reader little to learn by extending his researches in other quarters.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b530-5" data-blocks='[["BL_530.5",530,[308,402,1166,2011]],["BL_531.1",531,[174,415,1170,429]]]'>
      <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>“ It is a necessary consequence of these principles that where land, bound by a judgment given as an indemnity, is sold under a subsequent judgment against the principal, the proceeds cannot be awarded to the surety without prejudicing the principal, who would be deprived of the means of paying the debt, nor to the principal or the plaintiff in the subsequent judgment without depriving the surety of his indemnity, and must be applied to the payment of the debt for which the surety has made himself answerable, as the only mode of disposing of them consistent with equity. If, therefore, the contest here lay solely between a judgment obtained against A. and B. for a debt due by A. as pi’incipal, and B. as surety, and a prior judgment given by A. to B., as a protection against the debt, B. could not turn the judgment held by him from its true object, and use it as a means of preventing the satisfaction of an obligation which he was bound to fulfil. But the peculiarity of the case is, that B.’s -judgment was given not only as an indemnity for the debt which he owed jointly with A., but also for a debt which A. owed to him, and it is said that so far as this latter debt is concerned he is free from any equity, and may use his prior lien as a means of obtaining payment. 1$ iowever, plain that a man who sets up a lien or hold on thejfelsll of another, as a reason why it should not go to the paymeiRrdff a debt for which they are both jointly bound, sins against th$oiprinciples of justice, which require that all rights which are, or partake of the nature of rights of property, should be used for the purpose of satisfying, and not of preventing the satisfaction of the debts of those who hold them. That property which has been taken in execution under a judgment against two defendants belongs to both of them, is obviously no reason why the proceeds should not be paid to the creditor, and the case is substantially the same when one of the defendants holds a lien or encumbrance on the property in question, and the other its body or <em>corpus, </em>unless the circumstance that the right of the former is less, puts him in a better position than if it were greater, and exonerates him from the operation of the jn’inciple that rights are to be postponed to duties and obligations. And no court should permit a defendant to say to a plaintiff, it is true, I owe you the money for which you have obtained judgment against me, and also true that you have levied on the effects of my co-defendant, who also owes it, but I have a prior lien on those effects for another debt, and will use it, not to facilitate the levy, but to defeat it <em>pro tanto, </em>or altogether, by diverting the proceeds from your pocket to my own, where they will be, and perhaps remain beyond the reach of any remedy that the law can give you. But it is unnecessary to examine the question on principle,' because the eases of Erb’s Appeal, 2 Penna. R. 296, and Heims <em>v. </em>Barnitz, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%2089" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Watts 89">8 Watts 89</a>, only differ from that <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>now before us in the fact that the first judgment was originally obtained and held by a third person, by whom it might unquestionably have been enforced to the exclusion of the second; and the decision of the court that it lost its priority by passing into the hands of one of the defendants in the second judgment, and could not be used by him for the purpose of preventing the collection of the debt out of the property bound by its lion, applies d <em>fortiori </em>in the present instance, where the elder judgment was designed in part as an indemnity against the obligation of the younger.</p>

Worrall to Richardson &amp; Pease, took a judgment against his principal, Wm. M. Worrall, for an amount of actual indebtedness, and for his indemnity against this and other liabilities, which he had assumed for the benefit of W. M. Worrall. On this judgment W. P. Worrall issued a <em>ft. fa. </em>August 3d 1859, and levied it on the goods of W. M. Worrall.</p>
    <p id="b533-10" data-blocks='[["BL_533.14",533,[192,1479,1163,341]]]'>The instrument of suretyship given by W. P. Worrall to Richardson &amp; Pease was a joint judgment against himself and W. M. Worrall, and on this judgment <em>ajft. fa. </em>was issued August 25th 1859, and levied on the same goods of W. M. Worrall as the prior writ above named. The goods were sold under both writs, and the question is, to which of them shall the proceeds of sale be applied ? It is part of the case that W. P. Worrall was insolvent on the 3d August 1859, and still is.</p>

Worrall, on account of the priority of his execution, but the court reversed the auditor’s distribution, and gave the money to Richardson &amp; Pease. The reasons of the learned judge are satisfactory to us. His ruling is justified by-the principle that was asserted in Erb’s Appeal, 2 Ponna. R. 296, and in Himes <em>v. </em>Barnitz, <a href="/watts/8/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 Watts 39" data-case-ids="1848377" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0039-01">8 Watts 39</a>. The funds for distribution in these cases arose from sales of real estate: in this case the fund is raised from personalty, hut this circumstance cannot affect the application of the equitable principle which forbids a joint debtor, who is insolvent, to divert a fund from a creditor to whom he owes it, into his own irresponsible pocket. True, W. P. Worrall’s prior lien on the goods was a legal right, superior to any right which Richardson &amp; Pease <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>acquired to the goods. But their right to demand the debt of W. P. Worrall was as legal and complete as his right to the proceeds of sale. The money is here for distribution, and equity will take notice of the legal rights of both parties. It will not overlook the fact that W. P. Worrall is attempting to intercept the fund by means of a judgment and execution, which were, in part at least, his indemnity against this very claim of Richardson &amp; Pease, and that if the fund be awarded to him, it will, by reason of his insolvency, be lost to Richardson &amp; Pease. To enforce his right under such circumstances, to the defeat of his obligation, would be inequitable and unjust. He is no better entitled to receive the fruits of the sale than he is bound to pay them over to Richardson &amp; Pease. As it would be equitable for him to hand over the money to Richardson &amp; Pease as soon as it should come into his hands, equity will take care to secure this result by not letting the money go into his hands at all, but will dispose of it as it would be his duty to apply it.</p>
