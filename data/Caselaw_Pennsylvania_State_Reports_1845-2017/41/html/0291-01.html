      <em>by </em>Deborah Wells against William and Robert Forsyth. The plaintiff declared in trover for mining and carrying away coal from her lands, to which defendants pleaded not guilty. On the trial a <em>nolle prosequi </em>was entered as to William Forsyth, and the case tried against Robert alone.</p>

The surface being rough and hilly, the dividing line was not exactly known; and the plaintiff claimed that the defendant had dug coal in his drift over the line and out of her land; which was denied.</p>

Griffith, the line between the Wells and Forsyth tract is where he run it in the fall of 1860; and this line places a part of the coal drift used by the defendant upon the Wells tract.' All the coal, therefore, which he mined on this locality he must account for in this action, unless he can show that he claimed the <em>locus, </em>and h.ad it in his actual possession. As to what would constitute actual adverse possession, as against one in constructive possession under a perfect title, as shown by plaintiff, we would say that the occupation must not be occasional, but constant, actual, visible, and notorious. We do not say that where there is an actual possession for the purposes used by the defendant, there should be a corresponding surface possession, when there is no actual possession by the owner. Nor is it necessary that the party claiming the actual possession should be constantly in the bank; but such kind of occupancy as is usual with such kind of property. With this explanation, you will, perhaps, have .little difficulty under the evidence in finding that the defendant was in the actual possession of this coal bank <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>during the period in which he abstracted this coal. Your next inquiry will be, did he claim this place adversely as belonging to his own tract, or rather, I should say, within the lines of his tract ? To ascertain this you ■will inquire what line did he claim ? If to the line as run by Mr. Griffith, then it makes no difference whether he. was aware that line would include the place he was mining or not. It is not a question whether he was mistaken as to the location of his drifts in respect to the surface line; but the fact whether the line run by Griffith is the true boundary between the plaintiff and the .defendant — for, if holding by mistake, he was not holding adverse.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b295-6" data-blocks='[["BL_295.6",295,[207,896,1169,862]]]'>“Now, if you believe from this that defendant claimed to the Griffith line, and that line gives to the plaintiff the place where this coal was taken from as claimed by her, she will be entitled to recover in this form of action. And we charge you that it matters not that defendant supposed during the whole time he was mining this coal, that it was on his own side of the line. If, on the other hand, you believe defendant claimed to a different line, one which would throw the coal mined on his side, tho plaintiff cannot recover. This last observation must be qualified. If, during the time he was mining the coal, he intended to be governed by the true line, and this line run by Griffith is the true line, and he assents to it, plaintiff will not be prevented from her recovery, because defendant held to a mistaken line at the time the coal was being mined. If it was a mere mistake as to the location of the true line, and not a claiming of a different and distinct line, the action can be maintained; but if defendant did claim to .a line which would include the coal, the action cannot be maintained. There can be no disseisin by mistake; although the owner may elect to consider himself disseised for the purpose of bringing his ejectment.”</p>

The plaintiff insists <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>that, because the action is allowed for the coal as personal property, that is, after it had been mined or severed from the realty, therefore, by necessary logical sequence, she is entitled to the value of the coal as it lay in the pit after it had been mined; and so it was decided below. It is apparent that this view would transfer to the plaintiff all the defendant’s labour in mining the coal, and thus give her more than compensation for the injury done.</p>
    <p id="b297-6" data-blocks='[["BL_297.6",297,[215,750,1166,429]]]'>Yet we admit’ the accuracy of this conclusion, if we may properly base our reasoning on the form, rather than on the principle or purpose of the remedy. But this we may not do; and especially we may not sacrifice the principle to the very form by which we are endeavouring to enforce it. Principles can never be realized without forms, and they are often inevitably embarrassed by unfitting ones; but still the fact that the form is for the sake of the principle, and not the principle for the form, requires that the form shall serve, not rule, the principle, and must be adapted to its office.</p>
    <p id="b297-7" data-blocks='[["BL_297.7",297,[214,1181,1165,602]]]'>Just compensation in a special class of cases is the principle of the action of trover, and a little study will show us that it is no unyielding form, but adapts itself to a great variety of circumstances. In its original purpose, and in strict form, it is an action for the value of personal property lost by one and found by another, and converted to his own use. But i,t is not thus restricted in practice; for it is continually applied to every form of wrongful conversion, and of wrongful taking and conversion, and it affords compensation not only for the value of the goods, but also for outrage and malice in the taking and detention of them: 6 S. &amp; R. 426; 12 Id. 93; <a href="/watts/3/0333-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 Watts 333" data-case-ids="1841276" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0333-01">3 Watts 333</a>. Thus form yields to purpose for the sake of completeness of remedy. Even the action of replevin adapts itself thus : <a href="/nc/46/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Jones 381" data-case-ids="8682624" data-case-paths="/nc/46/0381-01">1 Jones 381</a>.

    <p id="b297-8" data-blocks='[["BL_297.8",297,[213,1784,1164,515]]]'>In very strict form, trespass is the proper remedy for a wrongful taking of personal property, and for cutting timber, or quarrying stone, or digging coal on another man’s land and carrying it away; and yet the trespass may be waived and trover maintained, without giving up any claim for any outrage or violence in the act of taking: 3 Barr 13. It is quite apparent, therefore, that this form of action is not so uniform and rigid in its administration as to force upon us any given or arbitrary measure of compensation. It is simply a form of reaching a just compensation, according to circumstances, for goods wrongfully appropriated. When there is no fraud, or violence, or malice, the just value of the property is enough : 11 Casey 28.</p>

Sometimes it is even necessary; because the plaintiff, with full proof of the conversion, may fail to prove the taking by the defendant. But when the law does allow this departure from the strict form, it is not in order to enable the plaintiff, by his own choice of actions, to increase his recovery beyond just compensation; but only to give -him a more convenient form for recovering that much.</p>

But even then, we cannot avoid feeling that there is a taint of arbitrariness in such a mode of calculation, because it does not truly mete out just compensation: 5 M. &amp; W. 351; 9 Id. 672; 3 Queen’s B. 283; and see 28 Eng. L. &amp; E. 175.
