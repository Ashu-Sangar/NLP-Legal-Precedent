From the latter there is an appeal by bidding over, but the former, if fairly made, is binding as a contract on all the parties. Part of the agreement was affirmed by the court and part of it set aside. When the guardian of Washington Mason’s heirs agreed that purpart No. 3 should be valued at $9500, instead of $10,000, as fixed by the jury, it was agreed by the others that purpart 2 was to pay certain owelty to purparts 1 and 3, and this with full knowledge of the fact that the appellants were entitled to the first choice.
