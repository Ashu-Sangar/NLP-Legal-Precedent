As compensation for their personal services they were not entitled to charge: Beatty <em>v. </em>Wray, 7 Harris 518. Nor does the will of McFarland and the agreement of his executor, made in pursuance thereof, alter the rule of law applicable to this case. The agreement does indeed provide that they are to account only for profits after paying “ <em>all expenses, costs, charges, and services.” </em>This last word is supposed to authorize and justify Mr. Brown’s charge of $1792.50 for his attention to the furnace. The auditors thought not. They did not deny that the word “ services” in the agreement might be construed to include Brown’s attentions, but they denied the right of the executor to make any such contract. They said the will authorized no agreement to pay for a partner’s services in closing up the concern, and the <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>executor had no power, <em>virtute officii, </em>to subject the estate to such a charge.</p>

They have not only rendered very good reasons for the faith that was in them, but they have examined the arguments and authorities so satisfactorily, on which the plaintiff in error’s counsel rely, as to save us much trouble. We agree with them that there is nothing to take this case out of the ordinary rule of law, and that if the executor’s agreement was designed to do so, it was void for defect of authority. But we incline to the opinion that the word “ services” pointed to the employment of a manager. The furnace was conducted by Martin B. Wilson as manager, and for his services Mr. Brown was allowed a full credit. There was a clerk also, and other employees, and although the cost of all these might well enough have been considered as covered by the words “ expenses and charges,” yet it is not strange that the other word “services” should have been employed as referring to the same subject. Tautology, which is one of the commonest vices of American style, is thought to add strength to agreements and other legal documents. This very agreement affords another instance of the same sort. Having treated for all the “real and personal property” of the furnace, the parties put themselves to the trouble of interlining and noting in the attestation the words “assets and chattels,” as if these words might possibly embrace something omitted by the words “real and personal property.” In like manner we suppose when they thought of the outlays necessary for carrying on the furnace, they called them by the triple title of costs, expenses, and charges, but did not mean by either or all of the words to compensate the surviving partners for time and trouble in attending to partnership property, which the deceased partner had attended to in his lifetime without charge for his services.</p>
