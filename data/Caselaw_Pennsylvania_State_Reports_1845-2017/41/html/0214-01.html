But the testimony shows that the bill was taken from Whitney &amp; Co., on an indebtedness of theirs to the plaintiffs, and for which they received a credit to the extent thereof; and if this was so, it was a consideration sufficient in law, as much so as if money had been paid in place thereof. It is difficult to see what,difference there is, in principle, between a money consideration actually paid, and the discharge of a liability already existing, to entitle the holder of the bill to recover on it, provided he was ignorant of the equities which might affect it in others’ hands. And if the defendant has intrusted the bill to an unfaithful agency, it may be, as it unquestionably is, a misfortune to him, but one which he cannot throw the consequences of upon those who were ignorant thereof, and who took it in good faith and for a valuable consideration.</p>

If not payable at that place, then there is a want of the diligence required by law to be used to find the acceptor: Duncan <em>v. </em>McCullough, 4 S. &amp; R. 480. Inquiry should have been made elsewhere: Ellis <em>v. </em>Commercial Bank, 7 Howard Miss. Rep. 294.

If, <em>primd facie, </em>the superadding “ <em>Warren, Warren Co., Pa.,” </em>indicates the place of endorsement, then by the clearest analogy, adjudicated cases and the Act of Assembly of 13th May 1850, Purd. Dig. 91, the same is essentially material. Adding the words and figures “78 Beaver St., New York,” under the drawee’s name as and for his address, fixes the place for demanding payment (Pierce <em>v. </em>Struthers, and Struthers <em>v. </em>Blake <em>et al.), </em>and hence is material. When a drawee accepts a paper so addressed to him, although done by simply writing his name in another place on the face of the bill, without any addition thereto, he thereby <em>primd facie </em>adopts the place of address for this purpose. It follows, that the endorser’s name, with the name of a place immediately under written as his place of' address, is like <em>primd facie </em>evidence, not only that such endorsement was made at that place, but that the same is the stipulated place for direction of notice of protest. That this place being the true one makes no difference, it is a false endorsement notwithstanding. As between the acceptor and all other parties, the law of the place for demanding and making payment, to wit, the law at “78 Beaver St., New York,” governs: Musson <em>v. </em>Lake, 4 Howard U. S. Rep. 277-8; but as between them and this endorser, the law. of Pennsylvania prevails, for that is <em>primd facie </em>the place of the contract: <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Howard%20262" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 Howard 262">Id. 278</a>.

As respects this endorser and plaintiffs, it is <em>primd facie </em>a foreign bill, or foreign endorsement, which is the same in effect: Purd. Dig. 91.

It was never pretended this evidence was competent, if plaintiffs were <em>bond fide </em>holders of the bill for value, in the usual course of business, according to the commercial sense of this language. The bill drawn, accepted, and endorsed in New York, is subject to the laws there as the place of the contract: Hazlehurst <em>v. </em>Kean’s Administrator, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Yeates%2020" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="4 Yeates 20">4 Yeates 20</a>, 3 Cowper 343. The actual place of the defendant’s contract of endorsement then is apparently, by the alteration, changed to Pennsylvania, where the law is or may differ from the other. The law in New York is, that where a creditor receives the transfer of a negotiable note or bill in payment of a precedent debt, he takes it subject to all the equities existing between the original parties: Rosa <em>v. </em>Brotherson, <a href="/wend/10/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="10 Wend. 85" data-case-ids="2012904" data-case-paths="/wend/10/0085-01">10 Wend. 85</a>-6; Ontario Bank <em>v. </em>Worthington, <a href="/wend/12/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="12 Wend. 593" data-case-ids="11271635" data-case-paths="/wend/12/0593-01">12 Wend. 593</a>; Payne <em>v. </em>Cutler, 13 <a href="/wend/12/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="12 Wend. 593" data-case-ids="11271635" data-case-paths="/wend/12/0593-01">Id. 605</a>; Smith <em>v. </em>Van Loan, 26 <a href="/wend/12/0593-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="12 Wend. 593" data-case-ids="11271635" data-case-paths="/wend/12/0593-01">Id. 659</a>.

If they succeed in the case their condition is improved; if they fail they are in no worse situation than before, for they have parted with nothing. Such is the settled law in New York. This defence in the courts of New York would have been permitted. It should have been permitted here upon proving the making, accepting, endorsing, simultaneously done there. The <em>primd facie </em>proof afforded by the alteration was a falsity. The truth remains at the risk and expense of defendant.

It is absolute, and on its face unusual and meaningless, except to indicate the pla.ce where endorsed.

The bill was made and endorsed in New York, and is to he governed by the law of that state; but in that state, as well as in Pennsylvania and all other commercial countries, an endorser who gives credit to a note or bill by his endorsement, whether with or without consideration, is bound to make the paper good in the hands of any subsequent endorsee who receives it for value, and in the ordinary course of business.</p>

In the last of the above cited cases, which was nothing more than a fraudulent pledge of two notes as security for an antecedent debt, the payee was permitted to recover them from the holder in an action of trover, Chancellor Walworth reviewing all the authorities bearing on the main question, and strongly questioning the doctrine of the U. S. Supreme Court, as announced in Swift <em>v. </em>Tyson, <a href="/us/41/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="54" data-cite="16 Pet. 1" data-case-ids="102735" data-case-paths="/us/41/0001-01">16 Pet. 1</a>. In the case of Dezeng <em>v. </em>Fyfe, 1 Bosworth’s (N. Y.) R. 335, it was declared by the Superior Court of the city of New York, that all the above cases were instances of the fraudulent misappropriation of a note, or where there was some fraud in procuring it, or where there existed some circumstances in the relation of the parties which would make its collection operate as a fraud on the maker; and it was accordingly held by that court, there being no taint of fraud in their case, that the maker of a promissory note for the accommodation of the payee, cannot set up as a defence that the note was transferred to the plaintiff.in satisfaction of, or as collateral security for, a pre-existing debt. The circumstances of the case showed that nothing wras given up in consideration of the note when it came to the endorsees’ hands.

I have not thought .it worth while to go into a minute analysis of the New York cases, to see how sound'the distinction is which was suggested by the Superior Court, because in our case the evidence on the part of the plaintiff fully justified the court in assuming that the plaintiffs were <em>bond fide </em>holders in usual course, and for a valuable consideration. Darius Young swore that Til-den &amp; Co., of which firm he was a member, “took the draft after the endorsement by Struthers and Irvine, and passed it to Wm. Whitney &amp; Co., of Boston, within a few days after it was made, on account as business paper, we being indebted to them, having a running account with them.”</p>

Whitney &amp; Co. in account for money and goods, and I passed said draft to Wm. Whitney &amp; Co., in account <em>as part payment </em>of said indebtedness, and in the usual and regular course of business as business paper. They had no knowledge of its being accommodation paper.”</p>
    <p id="Avu" data-blocks='[["BL_230.7",230,[322,1156,1163,513]]]'>To the same effect is the testimony of David H. Sparhawk, a member of the firm of Whitney &amp; Co. This witness also described the transfer of the draft from Whitney &amp; Co. to Kendall &amp; Son, the plaintiffs below. His language was, “the draft came into the hands of plaintiffs, as I have already stated, on the 1st of March 1854, in part payment of the debt of my firm to theirs.” And Barnes says: “It was passed to plaintiffs in the due and usual course of business. The firm of Wm. Whitney &amp; Co. was indebted to them for money, received by them from purchases of wool belonging to plaintiffs, and said draft was entered on plaintiffs’ books to the credit of said Wm.

They both received it, to be sure, on account of antecedent indebtedness, but in part payment of that indebtedness. When they entered it as a credit on their books, they gave up so much of their debt. What more' could they have done, if the payment had been in cash ? What better title to the paper could a cash purchase have given the plaintiffs ?</p>

Unquestionably every alteration in a negotiable instrument, whereby the identity of the paper is in any way-affected, is material, and avoids it even in the hands of a subsequent endorsee for value, except as to him who made the alteration: Stephens <em>v. </em>Graham, 7 S. &amp; R. 505. But we hold that the noting of the residence of drawers and endorsers, after their names, does not affect the identity of a bill of exchange, nor avoid it, as to any of the parties to it. It is in the nature of a memorandum for the notary, that he may know how to address notices of protest. It does not vary the tenor of the bill, nor add to the responsibility of endorsers. As well might the customary file-mark, indicating when the paper falls due, be called a material alteration. When Struthers put his name on the back of this paper, he authorized notice of nonpayment to be sent to him at Warren, Pa., for that was his proper residence. Whether his admitted residence was conveyed to the notary by word of mouth, by a separate memorandum, or by the mark subjoined to his name, the bill remained the same as it was at first made by his endorsement.</p>
