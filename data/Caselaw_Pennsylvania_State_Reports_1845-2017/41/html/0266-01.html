On this latter day the will was entered of probate in the register’s office of the county. The plaintiffs, who are the trustees of the congregation, before the beginning of this suit <a id="p267" href="#p267" data-label="267" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*267</a>for the recovery of the $200, demanded the same of the executor, and tendered to him a refunding bond in due form and of ample amount, but he refused to pay the same or any part thereof. The jury say further that they are ignorant of the law of the case, and refer the same to the court for its decision thereon ; and if the law is in favour of the plaintiffs, they then say they find in favour of the plaintiffs for $200, with interest from the 26th August 1859, but if it be with defendant, then they say for the defendant.”</p>

This act, being restrictive of a common and natural right, cannot be extended by construction beyond the letter: Toml. L. Diet. 521. General expressions or terms will be restrained in particular cases when such is apparently the object, and the language will allow it: Bank <em>v. </em>Fitzsimmons, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Binn.%20356" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Binn. 356">3 Binn. 356</a>; Porter’s Case, 1 Co. Rep. 24. The expression “ in trust for religious and charitable uses” had received an adjudicated interpretation or construction, and therefore the legislature must be taken to have intended that sense only ; and it is a superficial view of the case to hold this bequest to be for a religious or <em>charitable </em>use in a legal sense. See Thompson <em>v. </em>Pitcher, 6 Taunt. 359; 1 Eng. C. L. Rep. 653; 1 Toml. L. Dict. 318; Brendle <em>v. </em>The German Reformed Congregation of Jackson township, 9 Casey 415; Griffith <em>v. </em>Cope, 5 Harris 96, as to the distinction between gifts from motives of charity, and a dedication to charitable uses.</p>

How, then, can it be adjudged a “bequest <em>in trust </em>for religious or charitable uses?” The statutory prohibition only extends to bequests of qualified interests, the uses of which are restrained by the testator himself <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>within the prescribed period of his decease. Only express trusts, created by will or' deed, are intended; and the judgment of the court below was more like legislation than judicial construction.</p>

These facts are admitted by the plaintiffs, or appear on record in the case. If such a ease does not come under the provisions of the Act of Assembly of April 26th 1855, in relation to religious societies, it would be hard to imagine one that would. The term “associate congregation” indicates its religious character as plainly and distinctly as it would be with the word “religious” prefixed to it. All lexicographers define the word congregation “as an assembly of persons for the worship of God, and for religious instruction.” The term has no other appropriate signification in our language. All this was distinctly understood and discussed upon the trial below, and the words “a religious body” omitted in the special verdict to avoid redundancy. The words religious societies are understood to mean congregations for religious instruction: Methodist Church <em>v. </em>Remington, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20224" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Watts 224">1 Watts 224</a>. In the case of Griffith <em>v. </em>Cope, 9 Harris 96, cited by the plaintiffs, the present chief justice, in delivering the opinion of the court, says “ a conveyance of land to a religious society implies a religious use.” That such societies may sell their land, provided they appropriate the proceeds to the same religious uses. The case of Brendle <em>v. </em>The German Reformed Congregation, 9 Casey 415, also cited by the plaintiffs, clearly maintains the same doctrine of religious uses. No extended construction of the Act of Assembly is claimed, but simply that the law be fairly and rationally interpreted and applied. No “common or natural right” is restricted by the Act of 1855; it only modifies the powers and privileges granted by former Acts of Assembly, and regulates, in some particulars, customs and practices derived from other nations. It is enough that the testator expresses his general intention to establish a charity by making a donation to any object or association deemed charitable: Magill <em>v. </em>Brown, Brightly’s Rep. 347. Where money <a id="p269" href="#p269" data-label="269" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*269</a>is given by •will, gift, or voluntary contribution to an association formed for general and public usefulness, it is a charity, and will be treated as such by the courts: Thomas <em>v. </em>Elmaker, 1 Pars. Eq. Cases 98.</p>
