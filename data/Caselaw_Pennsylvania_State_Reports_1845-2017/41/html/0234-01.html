Cases have repeatedly been decided, in which persons have given a full and fair price for goods, and where the possession has been actually changed; yet, being done for the purpose of defrauding creditors, the transaction has been held <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>fraudulent, and therefore set aside: Campb. 434; <a href="/mass/12/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="12 Mass. 245" data-case-ids="2052043" data-case-paths="/mass/12/0216-01">12 Mass. 245</a>; Id. 456. Thus, when a person with knowledge of a decree against a defendant, bought the house and goods belonging to him, and gave a full price for them, the court said that the purchase, being with a manifest view to defeat the creditor, was fraudulent; and, notwithstanding the valuable consideration, void: 1 Burrow 474-5. So, if a man should know of a judgment and execution, and, with a view to defeat it, should purchase the debtor’s goods, it would be void, because the purpose is iniquitous. The same doctrine has been laid down by the Supreme Court of this state, in a long train of decisions, where it is held that the sale, in order to vest the title, must be not only in good faith, but also for a valuable consideration paid by the purchaser. For, although, as it was ruled in Clemins <em>v. </em>Davis, 7 Barr 263, the purchaser actually <em>paid </em>a full price; yet, if it was made, with the knowledge of the vendee, for the purpose of preventing a levy by the sheriff, it would be void. <em>But, it is contended that if a sale be made for a full price, and the purchaser gave his negotiable notes therefor, without any knowledge that the vendor intended to hinder or delay his creditors, the sale is to be held valid. The learned counsel have failed to produce any authority for this position, nor do I think it possible for them to find such a case. </em>I do not decide that when a purchase is made in good faith, and negotiable notes given, and they are negotiated in the regular course of business, before any levy made on the property so purchased — all other circumstances being right — that such sale would be void. In Cadbury <em>v. </em>Nolen, 5 Barr 320, it was held that when A. made a sale of chattels, and transferred the securities to B., his judgment-creditor, B. may avoid the sale by an execution, if it was fraudulent as to creditors.</p>

It is not sufficient that the vendee go into possession with th'e vendor — this is called a mixed possession, which will vitiate the sale.

It is conceded that Dealcers paid no money on the purchase, but gave his negotiable notes, at six, twelve, and eighteen months, for </em>$600 <em>each] the first being without interest. </em>It is shown by the evidence that the notes were handed over by Connolly to his wife, as soon as they were given, and <em>it is not alleged or pretended that they have ever been negotiated.

The moment the levy was made by the sheriff, the plaintiff might have filed a bill in equity, to restrain Connolly and his wife from negotiating the notes, </em>and. if suit was brought on them, no recovery would have been allowed until the controversy about the title to the goods purchased were determined.

The case involved a question of fraudulent transfer of a store of goods. Connolly and wife, who had been in possession of a store, which was carried on in the wife’s name, completed a sale of the goods to Deakers for his promissory notes a few hours before the execution of Temple and Barker came into the sheriff’s hands. When the deputy sheriff called to make a levy, he found Connolly and wife both in the store, and with Connolly he had some conversation which he was permitted to prove on the trial. The admission of Connolly’s declarations is the first error assigned.</p>
    <p id="b243-17" data-blocks='[["BL_243.21",243,[182,2184,1162,215]],["BL_244.1",244,[306,413,1156,92]]]'>They were evidence, first, because he had joined his wife in making the sale, and was thus one of the vendors still in possession, under whom Deakers claimed; and next, because the circumstances afforded some evidence of concert and collusion, between Deakers and Connolly and wife, to defraud the creditors <a id="p242" href="#p242" data-label="242" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*242</a>of the latter, and therefore, the declarations of one were evidence against the other.</p>
    <p id="b244-6" data-blocks='[["BL_244.6",244,[305,500,1162,772]]]'>The evidence complained of in the second error, though not directly relevant to the immediate issue, was such as is usually admitted in cases of fraud, and was very proper as exhibiting the conduct of Connolly and wife on the eve of bankruptcy. It is a bad sign for parties who have been convicted of a fraud to complain of an excess of evidence. Their effort to draw the narrowest possible sight upon the pending issue, and to exclude everything which, according to the most rigid rules of evidence, is not relevant to it, indicates a consciousness that the transactions which surround the main fact will not bear investigation. But all experience proves, and rules of evidence are founded in human experience, that, if fraud is to be detected under the various cloaks it puts on, the conduct of the parties before and after the fact complained of, as well as in immediate connection with it, must be freely examined. Truth and honesty are not likely to suffer by the latitude of evidence allowed in cases of fraud, for the more thoroughly an honest transaction is investigated,, the more honest it will appear.</p>
    <p id="b244-7" data-blocks='[["BL_244.7",244,[302,1272,1164,941]]]'>We do not think the plaintiff has any reason to complain of the rulings of the court in respect to questions of evidence, nor of the manner of submitting the case to the jury. The learned judge expounded the law of actual and constructive fraud, and fairly submitted the question whether the sale to Deakers was for the purpose of hindering and delaying creditors. He refused to treat Deakers as a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser, because, although his three notes were for an amount about equal to the value of the goods, they had not been negotiated, but were still held by Connolly and wife, who might be restrained from parting with them to Deakers’s prejudice. A <em>bond fide </em>purchaser he could not be, whatever the amount of the notes, if he was in combination with Connolly and wife to place the goods beyond the reach of execution-creditors. The jury no doubt believed there was such a combination, and that the notes were only made to give the transaction an appearance of a fair purchase. The various propositions of plaintiff’s counsel were not specifically answered by the judge,, because he considered them sufficiently answered in the charge. We think the law of the case was sufficiently disclosed in the charge. The plaintiff could not have been benefited by a more specific response to his points, and, therefore, a failure to make it is no ground for reversal.</p>
