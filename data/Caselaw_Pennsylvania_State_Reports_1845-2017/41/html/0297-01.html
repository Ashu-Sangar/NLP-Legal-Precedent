The Penn Glassworks themselves belonged to Mr. Lorenz exclusively. The firm occupied a warehouse at No. 63 Water street, in Pittsburgh, which also belonged to Mr. Lorenz. By the articles of partnership it was provided that, in case of the death of either partner, the business should be carried on by the survivor for one year without any change; at the expiration of which time it should bo wound up. In pursuance of this provision Mr. Wightman carried'on the business for one year after Mr. Lorenz’s death. At the end of this time Frederick R. Lorenz, one of the administrators, bought from the administrators his father’s interest in the firm of Lorenz &amp; Wightman, except the outstanding debts, but neither paid nor gave security therefor; afterwards he bought from Mr. Wight-man his interest in the concern, except the outstanding debts. He then began to carry on the Penn Glassworks himself, using the same works and the same warehouse which had been before ’used by the firm, and which still belonged to the estate of old Mr. Lorenz. He also collected in a. large amount of debts due to Lorenz &amp; Wightman, after he bought his father’s interest <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>therein, and had in his hands that part of it which belonged to his father’s estate. In the winter of 1857 and 1858 he became involved on account of endorsements. The other administrators becoming aware of his embarrassments, on the 25th of January 1858 induced him to confess judgment to them, as administrators, for $62,850.32, the amount which he still owed the estate for the works, and for the money he had collected as aforesaid, after allowing him credit for all the moneys he had paid; and immediately put an execution thereon into the sheriff’s hands. On the same day, but at a later hour, he confessed a judgment to his mother, Catharine Lorenz, and his brother, Charles H. Lorenz, for their own use, and in trust for the other legatees and devisees of Frederick Lorenz, deceased, for $7135 of real debt, being the amount of rent which he had collected belonging to the estate. An execution was immediately put into the sheriff’s hands upon this judgment, but at a later hour than the other. On these writs the sheriff levied on all the personal property of F. R. Lorenz, being the stock connected with the glassworks, manufactured and unmanufactured at the works, and in the warehouse, tools, &amp;c., for manufacturing, store goods, &amp;c. On the 4th of February 1858 he commenced the sale, and on that and the two succeeding days completed it. The property sold for $29,692.37, and was purchased by the administrators. The sheriff made them, as administrators, a bill of sale of the property, with a receipt at the foot of it for the purchase-money. They on their part paid the sheriff the costs, $165.91, and gave him a receipt for the balance of the purchase-money, $29,526.96, as applicable to the administrator’s writ. Beside the $165.91 of costs, there was no money passed either way. It was then agreed by the devisees and legatees and administrators that the latter should go on, and work up the materials on hand, buying such other materials as might be needed for that purpose, for account of the estate; and when that was done, if it was deemed advisable, they should continue to carry them on for the same account. The administrators thereupon gave to Frederick R. Lorenz a power of attorney to attend to the business <em>“for them and in their names.” </em>In pursuance of the power the business was conducted by Frederick R. Lorenz, in the same place, under the same sign and brand, and without any apparent change, for about two years, except that the name of F. R. Lorenz, agent, was generally, but not always, put on the bills which were rendered for goods sold. In the mean time Mr. Lothrop, who had obtained judgment against F. R. Lorenz for $3441.06, issued an execution, and levied on all his right, title, and interest in a large lot of glassware. To avoid, as was said, other levies and lawsuits, the administrators of F. Lorenz, deceased, made a voluntary assignment to Thomas Wightman of all the property <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>held by them' as administrators, or in their own right, for the benefit of the creditors, heirs, and assignees of deceased. Wight-man claiming the property levied on under Lothrop, executor, this issue was formed as above stated. Between the time of making up the issue and the trial, George Darsie, Esq., was substituted as administrator <em>de bonis non.</em>

That a creditor whose debtor happens to be an administrator may not levy an execution on goods of the decedent, in the custody of the debtor only for purposes of administration, is a proposition which nobody will question.</p>
    <p id="b306-7" data-blocks='[["BL_306.7",306,[297,1307,1168,600]]]'>And although it was another gross irregularity in the administrators to assign over to Wightman assets which the law required them to administer, yet the assignment would be, as between the immediate parties thereto, sufficient to pass the legal title. It would bind the administrators and all the world, except only heirs and creditors of the decedent. Neither of this class of persons is here to object. Wightman, the apparent owner of the ’property when the issue was formed, was, therefore, properly made the party plaintiff. It is of no moment, in the view we are now taking of the case, that the assignment was made to Wightman after Lothrop’s execution was in the sheriff’s hands, for, upon the assumption that the goods belonged to the dead man’s estate, the execution became no lien, and was no obstacle to the assignment.</p>
    <p id="b306-8" data-blocks='[["BL_306.8",306,[302,1907,1164,517]],["BL_307.1",307,[208,433,1161,730]]]'>But it may be said that the defendant offered to prove that the administrators did not purchase in their representative capacity, but as individuals, and that if they purchased as individuals, a right of property vested in or remained undivested in Frederick R. to at least an undivided portion of the goods. If the bill of exception were so we should be obliged to reverse the judgment, for we cannot agree with what fell from the learned judge in rejecting the offer. If the three purchasers were partners, the interest of Frederick could be seized and sold for his debt, subject to the rights of partnership-creditors, and the fact that the purchaser could not succeed to the possession of the goods, but only to a right of account, would not forbid the levy and sale. <a id="p305" href="#p305" data-label="305" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*305</a>If the three purchasers were not partners, then Frederick’s interest was seizable like the undivided interest of any tenant in common. But does the bill certify us that any evidence tending to show that the administrators purchased in their individual and not their representative characters was offered ? It tells us that certain proceedings were had in the Orphans’ Court from which this conclusion would follow, and it refers to them with a <em>fro ut </em>the same, but it does not set them forth, nor even furnish us with an outline of them. In this respect the bill is defective, and it is a very important defect in this case, for, without a full exhibition of the Orphans’ Court proceedings, alluded to in the bill, we cannot conceive how they should prove in what character the administrators purchased. If the offer was made to the court below as it is certified to us,‘ it was rightly rejected, not indeed for the reasons assigned below, but because it did not tend to establish any interest whatever in Frederick It. in the goods in question.</p>
    <p id="b307-6" data-blocks='[["BL_307.6",307,[203,1164,1165,687]]]'>The other bill of exception on the rejection of Michael McCullough as a witness is also defective. It sets forth that he was called to the book and that the plaintiff objected to him on the ground of interest; that it was admitted that he was a judgment-creditor of Frederick It. Lorenz, and that the court sustained the objection and rejected the witness. Now we cannot agree that McCullough was disqualified by the fact that he was a creditor of Frederick, for he had no direct interest in the event of this suit, but what was he called to prove ? Anything the loss of an opportunity to prove which was injurious to the defendant ? The bill gives no answer to these questions. We are referred to the appendix of the paper-book for the offer, but the offer is not to be found there. Either in the body of the bill or in the appendix the substance of what McCullough was to prove ought to have been furnished, that we might see wdiether harm had been done-to the defendant by the error of rejecting him.</p>
    <p id="b307-7" data-blocks='[["BL_307.7",307,[203,1850,1160,174]]]'>Thus while both bills of exception afford some ground to believe that the court fell into two technical errors, they contain no evidence that the defendant was injured thereby, and therefore furnish no reason for reversing the judgment.</p>
    <p id="b307-8" data-blocks='[["BL_307.8",307,[861,2024,455,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
