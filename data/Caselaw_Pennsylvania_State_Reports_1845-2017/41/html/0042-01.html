Sweeny, who put them in his trunk, which was then placed on the stagecoach running on the National Road between those places. On the 29th September 1850, while the coach was on its way up Laurel Hill, in Fayette county, about three or four miles east of Uniontown, the straps of the stage boot were cut, and this trunk, with others, was taken and carried away. Within two years afterwards Hutchinson was arrested and tried for this theft, and on the 12th of September 1852, acquitted. Some time after this, the officers of the Bank having discovered evidence which convinced them that Hutchinson had actually taken the money, instituted this suit against him. To a declaration in the usual form, the defendant pleaded <em>actio non accrevit infra sex annos.</em>

The court erred in that part of their charge to the jury in which they say, <em>“ </em>another defence is, that this money belonged to the Mineral Bank of Maryland, and therefore the plaintiffs cannot recover. It appears from the evidence that this was a matter of controversy, after the loss, between the two banks. We do not see that the defendant need be very particular in adjusting this controverted question of property; but still, if it appears that the money actually belonged to the Mineral Bank, this action could not be maintained; but we are of opinion that from anything that appears in the evidence, this money belonged to the Merchants’ and Mechanics’ Bank of Wheeling at the time it was taken.”</p>

The court erred when they said to the jury, “ this larceny, it was shown by the evidence, was committed in September 1850, and this action was not brought until August 1858. This is more than six years from the conversion. A proceeding for the larceny against the defendant was commenced in March 1852, and he was acquitted in September 1852; during the pendency of the prosecution for larceny we are of opinion that this action could not have been maintained.”</p>

The court erred in saying to the jury that, “ previous to the commencement of this prosecution, if the jury believe that he fraudulently concealed the conversion of this money to his own use, the Statute of Limitations would not run; for a fraudulent concealment by the defendant that cause of action had accrued to plaintiffs is a good replication to the plea of the statute, and this will be the case, notwithstanding you may believe from the evidence, that he confessed the larceny or conversion to one, two, or more persons. If it could be shown that previous to the prosecution, the plaintiffs had been informed of the fact of the conversion by the defendant, the statute would commence to run from the time; for it seems to be ruled by the case cited in Bullor’s N. P. 130-1, that trover will lie for the value of articles stolen; but there is no evidence that plaintiffs knew of this conversion by the defendant before the commencement of this prosecution ; after the prosecution was commenced, the right to sue in trover is suspended until the acquittal of the defendant.”</p>

There is none such ; but it has'often been held, for the sake of public justice, that the private action of trover is suspended until the public prosecution for the offence has been duly conducted and ended: Lofft 88, 601; 15 Q. B. 566; 2 Ad. &amp; E. 495 ; 2 Car. &amp; P. 41; 9 B. &amp; C. 208.

It is thus that the law is generally understood in this state, when the thief can be ascertained and found; and on this rule the case was rightly tried. The rule of course suspended the Statute of Limitations until the claims of the public were satisfied by the termination of the criminal prosecution; and this suit was within six years after that, and therefore in time.</p>
