After the expiration of this time, to wit, on the 4th of October 1850, leave was given to the defendants to withdraw their deed filed, and judgment was entered for the defendants. This action of ejectment was no doubt commenced with a view of destroying the effect of the action of ejectment No. 134 December Term 1843, as allowed by the provisions of the Act of 21st of April 1846. But the condition of the said judgment not having been complied with, it is claimed that it is effectual also under the provisions of the Act of 1846, to give the abso-lute title to the defendant. Waiving the point whether the parties stood to each other in a relation which would allow the operation of this act in the rescission of contracts, we are of opinion that the action of ejectment commenced by E. P. Oliphant <em>v. </em>Paull &amp; Gillis, No. 100 December Term 1847, he having become the owner of the Blocher title on the 9th of October 1847, would wholly destroy the effect of this judgment, No. 92 March Term 1847. It appears from the record, that, in February 1849, he had a verdict and judgment in his favour against Pauli &amp; Gillis. At this time the thirty-six months allowed to Blocher &amp; Co. to pay Pauli &amp; Gillis had not expired. Yet before the expiration of the time, the purchaser of the title of Blocher &amp; Co. obtains a judgment absolute against Pauli &amp; Gillis, the effect of which, in our opinion, is destructive of the terms of the conditional judgment. The judgment which was entered on the 4th of October 1850, for the defendants, on the judgment of Blocher &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Paull &amp; Gillis, No. 92 of March Term 1847, .will not <a id="p372" href="#p372" data-label="372" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*372</a>have the effect of destroying the legal consequences of the verdict and judgment in No. 100 December Term 1847.</p>

The purchase was with the money of the creditors, with an agreement to sell to Blocher, Shoemaker &amp; Taylor, not for the amount of Veech’s bid, but for the amount of the claims of his clients; and Veech did not thereby become the trustee of Blocher, Shoemaker &amp; Taylor in any other sense than as vendors by articles of agreement are usually called trustees, for their vendees, of the legal title. This relation was somewhat loosely expressed by Mr. Justice Bell, 2 Harris 342; but it is very accurately expressed by Lewis, C. J., in 3 Casey 425.

That judgment was afterwards reversed, because it ought not to have been entered until after the amount due on the legal title had been paid: 3 Casey 418; but that reversal did not affect the sale of the land; and therefore the sale cut off the equitable title held by Hill, and passed it to F.

And, as the words of the wise are very naturally taken on trust when duty does not require us to test them, we find his saying several times quoted, without question: 3 Casey 428, 468; 7 Id. 435. But in no instance where this has been said, was it a point before the court. Always it is a mere opinion by the way. And the very reason that is given for it shows its erroneousness — “for in no other (case) can time be of the essence of the finding.” This shows that the learned chief justice had not thought of the case of a vendor in possession and refusing to perform, where the verdict would regularly be against •him, with condition that the ve.ndee shall perform in a time ■named. There time is manifestly of the essénce of the finding. ,And the reason is good for nothing in the face of the fact that here we have a verdict, in an action by the vendee, in which time is an essential element. And in the latter part of the act, the case of ejectment by vendee against vendor, and a verdict allowing time, is provided for. The thought intended to be expressed is rather that the vendee alone needs a verdict on time, than that .he alone can be defendant in such a case. He <em>may </em>have it as plaintiff: 3 Casey 302; 1 Id. 361.</p>

Now payment of purchase-money is the usual form of specific performance by the vendee; but it is far from being the only form; for his contract may •require payment in goods, or stocks, or houses, and surely the law was intended for such cases also; and therefore we feel that ■we ought to read “specific performance,” instead of “payment .of purchase-money,” if we would not stick in the bark of the statute. This is necessary- also for the sake of equality; for we cannot suppose that the legislature intended that the judgment ■in the same controversy should be conclusive if one party be the plaintiff, and not so if the other be.</p>

It is admitted that if the vendor be plaintiff, he is concluded by the judgment, and must convey according to the terms of the verdict, and the defendant must pay according to it.

If we assume that this is not conclusive, the case will stand thus: the vendor’s hands are effectually tied until the time is out, and then the vendee may say that he will not perform, because the judgment is not conclusive. This would be to make the whole proceeding absurd. It would be declaring the judgment effectual if the plaintiff chose to accept it, and if not, it was no judgment at all for the matter contested, but only for the costs.</p>
    <p id="b377-6" data-blocks='[["BL_377.6",377,[179,799,1165,677]]]'>Moreover, when the vendee sues in ejectment on a mere agreement to sell, and a preliminary tender is not required by law, the case is almost sure to become an action “to enforce the payment of purchase-moneythe defendant, the vendor, becoming the real actor in demanding payment as a condition precedent to the delivery of the possession, and then the plaintiff is put under proper conditions, and the time fixed for payment by the jury “becomes of essence in their finding.” When Chief Justice Gibson- said that the Act of 1846 applied only where the vendor sues, he was showing that it did not apply in an action of ejectment on a constructive mortgage; and what he meant to say, therefore, was that it applied only between vendor and vendee, and not between mortgagor and mortgagee: Brown <em>v. </em>Nickle, 6 Barr 390. His remark was more special than he intended. Stated generally, as we have suggested, its logical fitness is manifest.</p>

And this brings us to another part of the Act of 1846, which provides that in case of all such conditional judgments entered since 5th of May 1841, the defendant shall have two years to commence an action to enforce his contract, and that the conditional verdict and judgment entered in such action shall be conclusive on the parties.</p>

This question was reserved, and afterwards decided in favour of the plaintiff. We think it ought to have been decided in favour of the defendant. The two judgments together are a valid bar under the last part of the Act of 1846; and the second alone is a valid bar under the first part of the act. We need not say that the first judgment had any effect upon the title. Perhaps it was too defective for this. But still it was a <em>fact, </em>a judgment confessed with oondition, of which time was an essential element. And for this fact, the law provides that there shall be a further action, which shall conclusively decide the rights of the parties. That action was brought and decided, and it is a conclusive bar to the claim set up here.</p>

The court left this fact to the jury, and they found the delivery; and the defendant assigns for error, that the question was improperly left to the jury. We think it was.</p>
    <p id="b378-7" data-blocks='[["BL_378.7",378,[276,1255,1168,854]]]'>It is very strange that such a question should be raised after nearly twenty years’ delay, and after so much litigation. Veech brought an action of ejectment in 1843 to enforce specific performance of the parol contract; and this involves the allegation that the contract had not been executed by the delivery of the deed. And the vendees confessed a judgment, which involves an admission of the same allegation, and they also specially stipulate that, on payment, “ the deeds now made shall be given up,” which certainly means that then, June 1844, they had not been delivered. And in 1847 the vendees sued and got a conditional judgment for specific performance, and this involves the same allegation on their part, and a judgment that it was true. There are, therefore, two judgments between the parties, founded upon and establishing the fact that the deed was not delivered, and the plaintiff, claiming under them, is estopped from denying it. And this second judgment conclusively shows what was then due, and certainly we are not to have another action of ejectment, to try whether that judgment has been satisfied. The’ judgment proves that it was not paid in October 1850, and there is no pretence of payment since.</p>

Pending the action No. 92 March Term 1847, by Blocher, Shoemaker and Taylor to enforce the specific performance of their purchase, their title was sold by the sheriff on a judgment of Ewing against them, and purchased by E. P. Oliphant. He got his deed twenty-two days after the conditional verdict was entered.

The action must go on, and did go on to its termination, without suffering any diminution of its efficacy by reason of his intervention as purchaser. Having purchased, he ought to have intervened to assert his rights in the pending action. It resulted in a decision that bound his title, by declaring that it should be complete and perfect, if within three years he should pay to Pauli the sum of $8500 and interest, and that if he did not, judgment should be entered in favour of Pauli, and in bar of the equitable title.</p>
    <p id="b379-6" data-blocks='[["BL_379.6",379,[176,843,1164,643]]]'>He did not intervene, and paid no attention to that important proceeding; but, in November 1847, shortly after the verdict in the case just mentioned, he instituted an independent action of ejectment against Pauli, and obtained a verdict and judgment in February 1849. This is very strange, and quite unaccountable. During this time the period allowed in the former case for the payment of the purchase-money continued to run, and Oliphant still paid no attention to that judgment or final decree in equity upon his rights. The period of redemption of the equitable title expired, without the payment required by the decree; and on the 4th of October 1850, a judgment was entered in favour of Pauli, which, by the very terms of the Act of 1846, was conclusive upon the parties, and of course upon their <em>primes </em>in estate, and operated as a rescission of the contract that constituted the equitable title.</p>
    <p id="b379-7" data-blocks='[["BL_379.7",379,[171,1487,1177,645]]]'>Now what effect could Oliphant’s judgment in February 1849 have upon the final decree upon his title entered in October 1850? Manifestly none at all. Even if Oliphant had taken" possession by execution under his judgment, it would not have relieved him from the duty of payment according to the terms of the prior judgment or decree in equity. Possibly his judgment might have been of some greater value to him, if he had intervened in the other case, and used his judgment as a means of preventing the final judgment or decree of 4th October 1850. But he did not intervene and did not perform the decree in his favour, and the alternative decree or judgment was entered against him. It is the last decree upon the title, and is quite a. regular proceeding, and sweeps away all prior and less efficient controversies and judgments, and especially the very anomalous proceeding of Oliphant against Pauli.</p>
