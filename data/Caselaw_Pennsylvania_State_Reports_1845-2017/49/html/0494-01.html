It is the interest of the <em>cestui que trust </em>that this should be the law, for he then has two securities — the liability of the defaulting trustee, and the trust property itself restored to the person in whose custody the law places it. Lord Lang-dale, in answer to an argument that a testator, having concurred in the breach of trust, was equally liable with the defendant, and therefore it was not competent for him in his lifetime, and it was <a id="p503" href="#p503" data-label="503" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*503</a>not competent for his representatives now, to apply to the court to be relieved from the consequence of his breach of trust, asked this question: “ Can there be any doubt that if two persons concur in a breach of trust, and one alone derive the profits, the other has a right to relief against him?” In Greenwood <em>v. </em>Wakeford, 1 Beavan 576, where the trustee of a marriage settlement concurred in a breach of trust by lending the fund to the husband on a security not warranted by the settlement, it was held that the representatives of such trustee could maintain a •bill against the husband, and the other <em>cestui que trust </em>for the restitution of the fund. “ There was,” said the Master of the Rolls, “ a clear demand arising from a breach of trust, in which their testator, it is true, had concurred, but in which he had concurred, for the use and convenience of Mr. Wakeford, the husband. I own I am rather surprised to find it alleged, even in argument, that persons placed in the situation of these plaintiffs are not entitled to apply to this court for relief, for at any moment a bill might have been filed against them by the wife or daughter, by their next friends, calling on them as representing the estate of the testator, to replace that which had been lent to Mr. Wakeford, the husband; and I conceive it to be clear that they had a right to proceed against the husband for the purpose of having the matter set right.” In Booth <em>v. </em>Booth, 1 Beavan 125, the same doctrine was enunciated, and the interest of a <em>cestui que trust, </em>who concurred with a trustee in a breach of trust, was held liable to indemnify the trustee. The Master of the Rolls said: “ That the widow concurred, seems to be quite clear, and any interest to which she may be entitled is the proper fund to resort to <em>in the first instance. </em>If she has obtained any benefit from the breach of trust, the trustee ought to be compensated in respect of it.”</p>
    <p id="b505-6" data-blocks='[["BL_505.4",505,[204,1764,1165,422]]]'>In Fuller <em>v. </em>Knight, 6 Beav. 205, this doctrine is carried still further, for there it was decided that a trustee cannot by contract waive his right to resort to the life interest of a tenant for life for the purpose of replacing a trust fund which, in breach of trust, he has lent to the tenant for life. “ What is asked is this, that the trustee shall be prevented applying the life estate in making good the breach of trust; and thus leave to chance the reparation of the breach of trust by confining the remedy to the personal liability of the trustee, or the estates of the deceased trustee.</p>

The court being apprised that a breach of trust has been committed, and that the trustee is desirous of repairing it, is required for the benefit of other persons to prevent his doing so, to withdraw the substantial means of reparation of the breach of trust, and to leave the wife, who <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>is now under the dominion of the husband, to her remedy against the trustees.</p>
    <p id="b506-6" data-blocks='[["BL_506.4",506,[290,530,1162,346]]]'>“ The question really comes to this, whether the trustee has done, or could do, or would be allowed by this court to do an act which would fetter his power of doing his duty. His first obligation was to perform the trusts; he had concurred in committing a breach of trust, and the instant he found he had done so, was it not his duty to repair it? And could he be permitted, in violation of his duty, to do an act for his personal benefit by which he deprived himself of the power of performing his duty.</p>

It seems to me to be the necessary consequence of the <em>cestui que trustent </em>for life having received the income of the trust fund unduly invested, that the trustees have a right to be indemnified as against the <em>cestui que trustent </em>for life, or their estates, to the extent to which those estates have been benefited by the improper investments,”</p>

The cases of Cresswell <em>v. </em>Dewell, 10 L. T. R., N. S. 22, and Webster <em>v. </em>Le Hunt, 8 Jurist N. S. 345, bear on the general subject; and in Rolfe <em>v. </em>Gregory, 11 Jur. N.

This wrongful receipt and conversion of trust property place the receiver in the same situation as the trustee from whom he received it.” Upon the ground of fraud, the receiver was held liable to the <em>cestui que trusts, </em>and that the Statute of Limitations did not apply to the fraud was concealed from the parties interested.</p>
