The widow was still living when the sale took place. And at that time there was no way to ascertain what amount to retain out of the proceeds of sale, for the payment of the $932.52, secured to be paid to the plaintiffs, was expressly deferred until the death of the widow — a period altogether uncertain and indefinite. The court, in such a case, would not undertake to make distribution, where it would become necessary to direct an investment of any part of the fund with a view to equalize the rights of the claimants to it. The court could not do it so as to reach anything approximating to certainty. It was a lien of indeterminate value. Besides, this encumbrance was a charge in the <em>title, </em>and the purchaser had constructive notice of it. It was a permanent charge during the life of the mother, and a judicial sale could not discharge it. The positions laid down are sanctioned by abundant authority. In Dewart’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20325" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts 325">7 Watts 325</a>, it is decided that a legacy by a testator to a son as trustee for a minor grandson charged upon lands devised to the son, to be paid to him, between the ages of twenty-one and twenty-five years at the discretion of the trustee, but to lapse on the death of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>before arriving at the age of twenty-five, is not, on the insolvency of the son and a sheriff’s sale of the land, payable out of the proceeds thereof, <a id="p13" href="#p13" data-label="13" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*13</a>but remains a lien upon the land.

This may be so, but the case may be viewed irrespective of any right of dower in the widow, and by force of the charge in the deed alone, the plaintiff will be entitled to your verdict. By the arrangement with the guardian, however, the widow secured to herself what was probably equivalent to her thirds — the postponement of the payment of a large portion of the purchase-money, to wit, $932, the money in question, until her death; and though, having the whole profits of the property during her life on this sum, no interest was to be paid. Of course the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale acquired her rights, and was not accountable for interest on the sum until her death.

There there was no express charge upon the land, and here there is. Such is our repugnance to implied or constructive liens that we refused to treat a recitation of unpaid purchase-money as a lien, though standing in the channel of the title, and we desire to be understood as having refused after great consideration of the subject; but where it is <em>expressly </em>charged the lien must be supported. It is the distinction between express and implied liens. Generally debts are not liens upon land <em>inter vivos, </em>and when a party alleges that a particular debt has become a lien, it .is not unreasonable to hold him to some affirmative proof of it, like a judgment, mortgage, or agreement. This excludes all risk of the courts holding that for a lien which the world does not; it excludes, in a w-ord, all the uncertainties of constructive liens, and furnishes a plain, straight path to walk in.</p>
