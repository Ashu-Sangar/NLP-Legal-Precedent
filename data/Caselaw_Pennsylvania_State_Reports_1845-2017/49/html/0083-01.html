    <p class="summary" id="b84-6" data-blocks='[["BL_84.4",84,[276,538,1162,1330]]]'>Jacob Seldonridge, the plaintiff, is a drover. On the 26th of May 1862, he had a lot of hogs for sale at the West Philadelphia drove-yard, where, on that day, Fretton and Schollenberger, together, called upon him, and after considerable discussion as to price and terms of sale, a number of hogs were purchased at the rate of four and a half cents per pound, net. These hogs were accordingly weighed by the weigher of the yard and duly delivered. The amount of the purchase, to wit, $948.96, was then charged to Fretton &amp; Schollenberger, in the book of original entries of the plaintiff below. This book was an ordinary account-book, such as is usually kept by drovers. After the sale Seldonridge, with his clerk, called at Fretton’s house for the purpose of settlement, when Fretton informed plaintiff below that, owing to the sickness of the wife of Schollenberger, he (Schollenberger) could not be present at the settlement. • Fretton then gave his own note, payable in thirty days, for $948.96, to Seldonridge. This note became due June 29th 1862, was protested and returned to Fretton, who then gave two checks, one for $800 and the other for $863.19. These checks included the amount of the note, with a small balance due from Fretton to Seldonridge. At the time of giving these checks it was not understood or agreed that they should be received in payment for the purchase of the hogs. These checks were not paid, and subsequently in November of 1862, Seldonridge, with his clerk, went to Fretton’s house, and from thence went with him to a neighbouring public-house, where Fretton paid $150, which was credited on the back of one of the checks. Immediately after the receipt of this money, Schollenberger entered the room, and desired the clerk to credit this $150 payment to the purchase of the hogs, which the clerk declined to do, as be said “ there was a balance due on the cattle” from Fretton to Seldonridge.</p>

It is difficult to conceive any ground of objection to the admission of the plaintiff’s book entry in evidence. The book wTas the usual drover’s hook; the entry was made under the direction of the plaintiff by his clerk, on the day of the sale, immediately after Seldonridge’s return from the drove-yard, where the hogs were sold, weighed by the regular weigher, and delivered. Both defendants were charged in the book, followed by the weight, the price, net weight, and the total in dollars and cents, in the usual and customary form used by drovers. It would have been error to reject it, and it was confirmed by all the evidence in the cause. The court made no error in answering the juror that if two parties were connected in business, the taking of a note from one would not release the other unless it was so agreed.</p>
