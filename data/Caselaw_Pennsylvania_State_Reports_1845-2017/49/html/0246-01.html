    <p class="summary" id="b249-9" data-blocks='[["BL_249.7",249,[184,1018,1166,430]]]'>“It is undeniably established by the proofs that both the defendant, who was the mortgagee, and the terre-tenant, who purchased the land from him after the execution of the mortgage, are in actual service in the army of the United States, and. that they were duly mustered into the -service before the <em>scire facias </em>was sued out on the mortgage. I am now moved to order a stay of execution upon the judgment which had been obtained, so long as the defendant and terre-tenant are engaged in such service, and until thirty days after they shall be discharged therefrom.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b249-10" data-blocks='[["BL_249.8",249,[178,1447,1171,602]]]'>“ The Act of Assembly of April 18th 1861, enacted that £ no civil process shall issue or be enforced against any person mustered into the service of this state or of the United States, during the term for which he shall be engaged in such service, nor until thirty days after he shall be discharged therefrom.’ In Breitenbach <em>v. </em>Bush, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Wright%20313" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Wright 313">8 Wright 313</a>, it was declared by the Supreme Court that a <em>levari facias </em>upon a judgment obtained on a <em>scire facias </em>on a mortgage, is within the prohibition of this .statute. It may be admitted that the present defendant is not entitled to its protection. He has parted with the property mortgaged, and therefore a <em>levari facias </em>upon the judgment can hardly be said to issue against him. But if he is not within the 'protection of the act, the terre-tenant is, for the execution must be enforced against his property.</p>

There is a provision in the mortgage (which is dated June 18th 1861), that if at any time default shall be made in the payment of interest on the said principal sum for the space of sixty days after any half-yearly payment thereof shall fall due, then and in such case the whole principal debt aforesaid shall, at the option of the said obligee, his executors, <a id="p248" href="#p248" data-label="248" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*248</a>administrators, and assigns, become forthwith due and recoverable at law. The mortgage also contains a further provision, <em>i. </em>e., <em>‘ </em>In case of default in the payment of the interest as aforesaid, that thereupon it shall be lawful for the said mortgagee, his executors, administrators, or assigns, to sue out forthwith a writ or writs of <em>scire facias </em>upon this present indenture of mortgage, with the same force and effect as if twelve months next ensuing the last day whereon the principal moneys hereby secured ought to be paid, according to the condition of the above-recited obligation had fully run out and expired, any law, usage, or practice to the contrary notwithstanding.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b250-7" data-blocks='[["BL_250.4",250,[298,902,1163,598]]]'>“ I do not perceive that either of these clauses in the mortgage amounts to a waiver of the statutory right to exemption from execution process. The mortgagor did relinquish his right to object to the issue of the <em>scire facias </em>until after the lapse of twelve months from the time when the whole debt should become payable, but he entered into no engagement respecting any execution of a judgment that might be obtained. The contract is entirely unlike that considered in Bilmayer <em>v. </em>Evans <em>et al., </em><a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20324" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Wright 324">4 Wright 324</a>. There the debtor stipulated that there should be no stay of execution after the appointed day of payment. Here nothing is said respecting a stay. I am of the opinion, therefore, that nothi ig in the mortgage warrants the issuing of a <em>levari facias </em>upon the judgment obtained in this case against the objection of the terre-tenant of the mortgaged premises.</p>

The mortgage, being the act of Miller, and an encumbrance upon the property sold by him to Griffith, fell within the covenant implied by the words grant, bargain, and sell, in Miller’s deed. He had therefore a direct interest in the stay of execution to prevent the immediate sale of the mortgaged premises, and save a breach of his covenant against encumbrances. But Griffith was no party to this record, and unless he can be brought within the spirit of the Act of April 18th 1861, cannot intervene to obtain a stay of execution. On this point we have some doubt, but as it is unnecessary to decide the question, do not express any opinion upon it.</p>
