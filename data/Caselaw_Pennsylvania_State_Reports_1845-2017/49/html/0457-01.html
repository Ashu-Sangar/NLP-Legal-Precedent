From it knowledge of the sale by his sub-agent might reasonably be inferred. If it was a map or draft of the estate’s land, it would most likely be constantly before the agent, and this, even without the article of agreement found amongst his papers, would be evidence on the point of knowledge and acquiescence in the sale. But this, with the article of agreement in his custody, or at least found amongst the papers of the agency as offered to be proved, would be pregnant proof from which to infer knowledge of the con<a id="p464" href="#p464" data-label="464" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*464</a>tract. If therefore knowledge of it might be inferred from the proof, it was one step in the process of proof of ratification. Long acquiescence in it, and in the possession under it (for the article bound the purchaser to take and keep possession whilst improvements were being made and taxes paid, which we may presume was the case from the actual occupancy), present a state of facts inconsistent with any theory but ratification or meditated fraud, a thing not pretended, certainly as to Dr. Rose, which would estop the holders of the legal title from denying the contract. Aquiescence is evidence of ratification, more or less expressive, according to the circumstances of the case: 4 Casey 329 ; 9 Id. 221. All the evidence of such facts, with their legitimate inferences, properly belonged to the case under the circumstances of it, and should have been admitted; and so far as they were rejected it was error.</p>
    <p id="b466-6" data-blocks='[["BL_466.4",466,[273,1072,1162,515]]]'>But the court also overruled another and most important item of evidence on this point, namely, the original article between Day and the estate, when offered in connection with the new article to Nancy Hall. On the back of it there was an entry, if I comprehend it aright, showing a deduction of several years’ interest, which evidently became the basis of the new contract on the subject of interest; this, with the offer to prove a credit on the new article of the small sum paid by Day, was evidence on the point of ratification not to be excluded. What could be stronger than making the old article the basis of a new one, especially when done at the request of the holder of it ? The exclusion of this testimony was error.</p>

If ratification of the original contract be established, and even if it appeared that he held the title honestly acquired from the trustees of the Bingham estate, being bound to take notice of the possession, he, like them, would be but a trustee for the heirs, and they could, within a reasonable period after coming of age, assert their title and recover as against him, on paying or offering to pay the unpaid purchase-money with interest; but if, by practising on the fears and feebleness of intellect of Mrs. Hall, he fraudulently procured her to surrender the original article and take a new one in her' own name, and then transfer it to him at an undervalue, and also surrender the possession, her children being under age, a recovery by the heirs, or either of them, might be had against him, without a tender or offer of the purchase-money.
