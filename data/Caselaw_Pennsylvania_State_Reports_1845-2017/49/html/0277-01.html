A bill in equity was pending in the Supreme Court, praying a decree for the sale of the whole estate of the company under the mortgages thereon. The parties in interest were the holders of the first mortgage bonds of the company, $1,500,000 in amount; the holders of the second mortgage bonds, $500,000 in amount; the holders of seven different issues of bonds secured by mortgages on personal property of the company, known as chattel mortgages, $400,000 in amount; and the holders of the stock, $3,000,000 in amount. These parties were represented by committees or attorneys appointed to attend to the interests of their constituents in the proceedings then pending. After the usual amount of negotiation, a scheme for purchasing in the property, and organizing a new company upon the basis of dividing the stock in certain proportions among those interested in the old company, was adopted. Among the holders of chattel bonds were the plaintiffs who, with the other parties (whose names are subscribed to the letter of attorney to O. W. Davis, Esq.), were the holders of bonds numbered from 681 to 747 both inclusive, and secured by a mortgage upon a locomotive engine and certain cars, executed by the company on the 26th day of July, A. D. 1859, to Joseph Paxton, trustee.</p>
