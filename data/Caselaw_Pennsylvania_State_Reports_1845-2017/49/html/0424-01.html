In the details of his report he says: “ The comb of the • dam is raised to the same height with the top of water-line of canal, and is 11.87 feet' above low-water-mark in the river immediately below the dam.” The Act of 9th of April 1827, authorizing the construction of this Delaware division, provided in the 7th section that the canal commissioners were authorized and required in behalf of the Commonwealth to contract for the construction of the navigable communication, and such locks and other works as may be necessary thereto, but, it was contended, gave no authority to enter on the valley of the Lehigh. This dam was kept up and used by the Commonwealth as a feeder for the canal until 1839, when proposals were issued by the Commonwealth for building of what was called a new dam for the same purpose, and a new dam was built by the state just below the old one. And was finished in 1841. The old dam still remained in its place undisturbed by the erection of the new one, and was kept in repair by the state, the new one being so leaky that the water, when at a low stage, could not be kept up by it to supply the canal. The water was kept up to its proper level by means of a mound of earth, stones, and gravel, placed a few feet back of the comb of the old dam. These dams were thus used and maintained by the Commonwealth until the public works, including the Delaware division, were sold by the state to the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, under the provisions of an Act passed 21st of April 1858.</p>

This improvement, made at first by Josiah White, George F. A. Hauto, and Erskine Hazard, became vested in the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company. One of the rights of the company was to use all the water from the river and works constructed by them, to propel machinery, and to sell to others to be used. The plaintiff is a purchaser, and has used a certain quantity of water from the company’s canal many years, and his action is for an injury caused by the backwater of a dam built by the state in the mouth of the Lehigh, and now kept up by the defendants. The action is upon the case' for the alleged unlawful act of maintaining the dam at the height causing the injury, and involves the right of the defendants to continue it at this elevation.</p>

Finding it insufficient to preserve the water at a proper level in the canal fed from it, in 1840 and 1841 the canal commissioners built a second dam a few feet below the former, and about fifteen inches higher, filling up the intervening space between them with stones and gravel. The new dam was found to leak very much, and to maintain the water at a proper level, the state agents were in the habit of placing stones and gravel, and sometimes timber along the top. In this condition the Delaware division passed into the hands of the defendants, under a sale by the Commonwealth, -first to the Sunbury and <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>Erie Railroad Company, in 1858, and then by a sale of the latter to the defendants in the same year.</p>

There is no question that the defendants are entitled to the lawful rights of the Commonwealth in this respect, and therefore the great, indeed sole question is, whether the Commonwealth had the right to build the dams referred to, and maintain the water at the height to which it was kept up at and before the time of her sale to the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company.

Many laws have been passed, stamping upon numerous smaller streams the same character to preserve the public control for the benefit of highway. A corresponding and marked feature has been the reservation of the islands in the navigable streams by the former proprietaries, and by the state.

Its origin is found in the Act of April 9th 1827, P. L. 192, which was followed by the Act of March 24th 1828, P. L. 221, and Act of April 22d 1829, P. L. 251. These laws provided for the surveys, location, construction, and maintaining of a navigable canal, called the Delaware Division of the State Canals, from a point on the' Delaware below the head of tide-water, to Easton. The power to do these things was conferred upon the canal commissioners, and the 14th section of the Act of 1827, and 17th section of the Act of 1828, extended to the execution of these laws all the provisions of the acts relative to the Pennsylvania Canal so far as applicable. The effect of this extension was to confer upon the commissioners, <em>engineers, </em>and other agents of the state, all the authorities necessary for constructing the canal along the Delaware to Easton, which lies on the northern bank of the Lehigh. The Act of April 11th 1825, originating the Pennsylvania Canal, in the 4th section, proceeds to provide, <em>“ </em>and further to adopt and recommend proper plans for the construction and formation of said canals, and of the locks, <em>dams, </em>embankments, tunnels, aqueducts, <em>feeders, </em>and reservoirs, whioh may be necessary for the completion of the same, and to cause all necessary plans and drafts thereof to be <em>executed </em>under their direction.” The Act of February 25th 1826, P. L. 55, conferred power upon one or two acting commissioners to superintend the making and constructing of the canals, and the determination of the location and dimensions of the canals and locks by the board, with the apprpbation of a skilful <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>engineer, and with consent of the governor. The Act of April 16th 1829, P. L. 200, conferred further powers, and was followed by the Act of April 6th 18-30, P. L. 218, passed during the building of the dam in question, which was closed, and the water let into the canal on the 11th of October 1830.</p>

The principal engineer was empowered to make the necessary surveys, estimates, and plans of all work, for the adoption or rejection of the board, lay out the work and superintend its execution, judge the work, and forfeit contracts, &amp;c.

Thus, it appears, authority the most comprehensive is given, vesting in the commissioners the largest discretion as to the location of the works, their kinds, modes of construction, adaptation to the purposes and exigencies of the navigation, and their preservation and repair in the proper operating condition. We are hound to believe the state agents, in the exercise of this wide discretion, did their duty, and that the erection of the dam in the mouth of the Lehigh (a confluent of the Delaware) was a proper part of the work of the Delaware Division Company, necessary to its successful operation. This presumption is fortified by the fact stated in the contract of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company for building ‘the dam, that it was to be constructed as a <em>feeder </em>to the Delaware division, the power to make feeders being clearly auxiliary to the main authority (Linton <em>v. </em>Bridge Company, <a href="/grant/1/0414-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Grant 414" data-case-ids="225838" data-case-paths="/grant/1/0414-01">1 Grant 414</a>), and comprehended also within the express provision of the 4th section of the Act of April 11th 1825, extended to this division by the Acts of 1827 and 1829. It has further support in the proviso of the 7th section of the Act of April 9th 1827, that the existing natural navigation of the river Delaware shall not be obstructed or injured by the construction of the said canal. This proviso was inserteddn consequence of the compact between New Jersey and Pennsylvania, dated April 26th 1783, ratified by New Jersey on the 27th of May, and by Pennsylvania on the 30th of September 1783 (Smith’s L. 77), which declared, in the 1st section, that the river Dela<a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>ware is, and shall continue to be and remain a common highway, equally free and open for the use, benefit, and advantage of said contracting parties.

If, in doing this, the property of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company, or any right vested in them, was injured, it was not by direct attack, falling within the constitutional inhibition to impair contracts, but it followed as a mere consequence of the lawful exercise of the right of eminent domain. Rights of property, corporeal and incorporeal, are held in subordination to this fundamental power of the state : West River Bridge Co. <em>v. </em>Dix, <a href="/us/47/0507-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 How. 507" data-case-ids="3349643" data-case-paths="/us/47/0507-01">6 How. 507</a>; Richmond Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Louisa Railroad Co., 13 Id. 71; <em>Lexington </em>and Ohio Railroad <em>v. </em>Applegate, <a href="/ky/38/0289-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="8 Dana 289" data-case-ids="4431541" data-case-paths="/ky/38/0289-01">8 Dana 289</a>; Boston and Lowell Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Salem and Lawrence Railroad Co., <a href="/mass/68/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Gray 1" data-case-ids="1998281" data-case-paths="/mass/68/0001-01">2 Gray 1</a>.

As a part of the evidence, it appears not only that the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company was the contractor to build the dam, but that they, within a year from its completion, presented their claim for damages, which was acted upon by the board.

If the argument be sound, it was a singular dereliction of the legislature to suffer finished public works to fall into dilapidation and decay, or if inadequate, and unfitted in their first execution, to suffer them to remain without any provision for repair or reconstruction. But neither the practice of the state nor her legislation is liable to this imputation upon her duty and her wisdom. Her constant practice was to keep up her works in suitable repair and operating condition, including new work rendered necessary by total decay, or the devastation of floods, <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>and annually she made appropriations for repairs and renewals. Her legislation to this end has not been neglected. The first section of the Act of April 6th 1830, made it the duty of the canal commissioners to devote their whole time and attention, by personal examination, to the general and special superintendence and repairs of the public works, finished and in progress, while the remaining sections provided for the execution of the details by engineers, superintendents, and supervisors. The innumerable acts appropriating moneys for the repairs and renewals of the public works, executed by these officers, are a recognition of the powers thus conferred. There is also the General Act of April 8th 1834, P. L., for the speedy reparation of injuries to the canals, feeders, dams, and other works. The appropriation in the Act of June 11th 1840, P. L. 645, passed while the second dam was in progress, provided also for <em>new woric on finished lines. </em>In consequence of the freshets in November 1840 and January 1841, by which this dam before its completion was, with other portions of the Delaware division, much injured, the legislature-, by the Act of February 11th 1841, P. L. 437, authorized and required the canal commissioners to repair this division with as little delay as possible, and to construct all aqueducts, and locks required to be rebuilt of such dimensions as to permit boats of 120 tons burthen to pass through.</p>

We do not say an argument might not be justly made against the power of the canal commissioners, without a fresh authority, to change and expand the whole division into a new work of greater capacity. But this does not touch their power to repair and to rebuild (when the necessity demands it to preserve the navigation) those parts of the works which have fallen into decay, or were originally inadequate for their purpose; to rebuild, as in this case, a new dam to supply the place of the former, which was found to be inadequate to supply the water necessary to the navigation in the level it was intended to supply.</p>

This matter fell exclusively within the judgment of the canal commissioners. It was their right and their duty to maintain the navigation, if they chose, by raising the dam to a proper elevation to suit the level as already constructed, rather than to sink the level and all its works to suit the dam. This right and duty devolved upon the defendants. The' 8th section of the act for the sale of the public works provided that “the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company, or their assigns, shall be bound to keep up the same, including public and private bridges crossing the said canals, as heretofore done by the canal commissioners, <em>in as good repair and operating condition </em>as they now arc; and they shall be and remain public highways for ever for the use and enjoyment of all persons desiring to use the same.”</p>

It was an ordinary conveyance of a certain lot of ground, acquired by purchase and held, just as every citizen owns and holds his title directly or indirectly from the state, as the original proprietor. Annexed to this ordinary ownership was the water privilege sold under the power contained in the charter, and granted in the usual form and terms, to wit: “And together with the right and privilege of drawing from the said canal, through the forebay or tunnel, from time to time, and at all times hereafter for ever, so much water as can pass through an aperture in a metallic plate at least one inch in thickness, which aperture is to form an opening in the said plate of one hundred square inches,” &amp;c., “which water is to be drawn under a three-feet head, to be measured from the middle of the said aperture to the face of the water in the said canal,” &amp;c. The right passing under the deed was therefore only that of drawing off a specified quantity of water under a given head; and though the right to use it upon the lot flowed as an inference from the grant, yet the deed itself did not guarantee when, where, how, or to what extent of fall the water should be used. The specified head of water was given, but after it left the works of the company and fell upon his land, it there partook of no other properties as to his right therein than those of a natural waterfall. He had the same rights in its use, and injuries to it upon his ground were of the same nature as they would be in an ordinary case. In short, after the water reached his land it partook only of the incidents of ordinary ownership.</p>

After his conveyance, he stood in no relation to the state different from that which he would have held had his lot been derived directly from her patent. The injury therefore which followed the raising of the water in the stream to improve navigation was not a taking of his property, but one merely consequential which he must suffer <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>without compensation, unless the state should choose out of grace to concede it.</p>

If, therefore, he chooses to place his mills or his works, for the qualified use which he may make of the water, within the limits or influence of high water, he does so at his own risk, and cannot complain when the Commonwealth, for the purpose of improvement, chooses to maintain the waters of the stream at a given height within its channel. Without repeating the argument, it is only necessary to say that the doctrine of the non-liability of the Commonwealth for consequential damages has been so repeatedly asserted and firmly established, a reference to some of the authorities must suffice: Monongahela Navigation Co. <em>v. </em>Coons, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0101-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 101" data-case-ids="480106" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0101-01">6 W. &amp; S. 101</a>; Susquehanna Canal Co. <em>v. </em>Wright, 9 Id. 9; Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad Co., <a href="/whart/6/0025-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="6 Whart. 25" data-case-ids="1836978" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0025-01">6 Whart. 25</a>; Henry <em>v. </em>Pittsburgh and Allegheny Bridge Co., <a href="/watts-serg/8/0085-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 85" data-case-ids="483385" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0085-01">8 W. &amp; S. 85</a>; Monongahela Navigation Co. <em>v. </em>Coons, 6 Barr 379; Mifllin <em>v. </em>Railroad Co., 4 Harris 182; New York and Erie Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Young, 9 Casey 175; Watson <em>v. </em>P. &amp; C.
