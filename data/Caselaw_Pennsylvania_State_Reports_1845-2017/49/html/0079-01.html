The proper order as to an issue was made by the court, and also as to notice to all persons interested in the estate of the decedent as heirs, relations, or next of kin, devisees, legatees, or executors. A <em>narr. </em>was filed by the plaintiffs, to which the defendant pleaded, and issue was formally joined, and the question to be tried was, whether this paper was or was not the last will and testament of the decedent. When the cause was called the counsel for the defendant objected to trying any other fact than whether the paper purporting to be the will of the decedent was procured by duress or constraint, and the court said they would allow the defendant’s counsel to give in evidence any matter, either duress, undue persuasion, or mental imbecility, in opposition to the alleged will, but the defendant’s counsel declined to try any other fact than whether the alleged will was procured by duress or constraint. This statement is called on the record a discourse, and is only an account of a conversation prior to the calling of the jury.
