    <p id="b492-10" data-blocks='[["BL_492.9",492,[279,1883,1158,170]]]'>The fallacy of this reasoning, in mere matter of logic, is plain on its face, for a man’s children and their issue are not his heirs, but only some of his heirs.

    <p id="b492-11" data-blocks='[["BL_492.10",492,[277,2054,1163,386]]]'>1. If the fact were so, it would be immaterial, for the rule in Shelley’s Case does not apply to designated persons, though they be in fact heirs. Thus, a gift to A. for life, remainder to his first, second, and other sons in tail successively, remainder to his daughters as tenants in common, remainder over (which would be exactly the course of descent of an estate tail in A.), does nevertheless not give him an estate tail, but only a life estate: Goodtitle <em>v. </em>Herring, 1 East 164; Guthrie’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%2021" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="1 Wright 21">1 Wright 21</a>.</p>

The persons who would take, under the Intestate Law, as the “ heirs” of A., are not necessarily the same as those who would take under a gift to A. for life, and after his death to his children, and the issue of those then dead. When they are identical it is by accident, for they refer to a different stock of descent.</p>

This would give a vested estate in fee simple to the children respectively, as they came into being, subject only to be divested in case of their respective deaths leaving issue, which has not happened: Smith on Executory Interests, § 282; Chew’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%2024" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Wright 24">1 Wright 24</a>.

That the word “heirs,” or “heirs of the body,” may be by subsequent words explained to mean sons, daughters, or children, is one of the best established and most familiar exceptions to the rule in Shelley’s Case: 2 Jarman on Wills 300; Lowe <em>v. </em>Davies, 2 Ld.

    <p id="b494-6" data-blocks='[["BL_494.4",494,[292,504,1165,249]]]'>The whole case is clear and simple. The first apparent gift in fee to Sarah Bache is cut down by the subsequent words (which if there were a conflict would govern in a will), to an estate for life, with a gift by way of remainder in fee to her children, and the issue of any of those who might be dead at her decease.</p>

    <p id="b494-8" data-blocks='[["BL_494.6",494,[293,937,1163,427]]]'>The relief prayed by the bill is twofold: — First. To have the real estate which was devised by the testator in trust for Mrs. Sergeant and her children, conveyed to the latter by the present trustee under his will. About the right to this there can be no doubt, as is above shown. The proper parties are before the court. The complainant and her brother are also the heirs at law of Mrs. Sergeant. Her legatees are represented by her executor, Mr. Miller, who having a power and trust for sale, is a sufficient party on their behalf under the present equity rules. There can be no objection to the decree in this respect.</p>
    <p id="b494-9" data-blocks='[["BL_494.7",494,[291,1364,1168,471]]]'>Second. To have the personal estate of Mrs. Sergeant applied to repay the amount for which the twrenty-four shares of stock of the American Fire Insurance Company were sold, with interest. At the time this stock was transferred, as alleged in the bill, the original trustees in whose name the stock stood were dead, and none others had then been appointed in their place. The transfer was effected under a power of attorney executed by herself, a copy of which is annexed to the bill, in which it was alleged that the trust was at an end, and that she was entitled to an absolute interest therein. Induced thereto by this allegation, the company permitted the transfer.</p>

If we should sue them they would in turn recover back the like amount from Mrs. Sergeant’s executor. To avoid circuity and expense this is the simpler and at the same time the fairest course, for the company was misled, and received no benefit from the breach of trust, while Mrs. Sergeant did. The complainant was 'therefore entitled, first, to a conveyance of the moiety of the real estate mentioned in the <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>pleadings; second, to elect either to have replaced specifically the one-half of the twenty-four shares of stock, or to receive half of the proceeds of their sale, with interest from her mother’s death; and, if necessary, she was entitled to ask that the Clinton street house (in whose purchase a part of such proceeds was invested), be sold by her mother’s executor fpr that purpose.</p>

If only a life estate, then the decree below is right.</p>
    <p id="b495-7" data-blocks='[["BL_495.10",495,[175,913,1164,206]]]'>Richard Bache, by his will dated January 2d 1810, and proved on the 2d of August in the same year, gave to three trustees in fee simple a seventh part of his estate in trust for Sarah Bache, afterwards intermarried with Judge Sergeant, whom she survived.</p>
    <p id="b495-8" data-blocks='[["BL_495.11",495,[175,1129,1165,903]]]'>The trust was for her life, and after her decease to convey the said seventh part to her children (if she should marry and have children) and the issue of any of her deceased children, to be equally divided among them as tenants in common, and not as joint tenants; but all the issue of a deceased child shall only take the share and proportion to w'hich their parents would have been entitled, had he or she survived the said Sarah Bache, and no more. This undoubtedly would give Mrs. Sergeant only an equitable'life estate. Then follows a provision which is inoperative under the circumstances, and which might for the purposes of the present case be stricken out of the will, giving her power, in case she left no children or issue as aforesaid, to appoint the said seventh part by her last will, or writing in nature of a last will, to such persons and for such estates as she should think proper. The trustees were given power to sell the said premises, and it is conceded that the whole legal estate in the same was vested in them. It is clear, also, from the examples given by the plaintiff’s counsel, that this will under certain contingencies would produce different results as to the persons entitled to take from the Intestate Law, supposing Mrs. Sergeant to have had a fee simple, and to have died intestate.</p>
    <p id="b495-9" data-blocks='[["BL_495.12",495,[176,2032,1164,389]],["BL_496.1",496,[311,409,1162,175]]]'>The only argument against the construction giving only a life estate to Mrs. Sergeant, under the present rulings of the court, and which I do not think it necessary to repeat or discuss, is founded upon these words introductory of the clauses which have been mentioned: “ In trust, nevertheless, for the use and benefit of my daughter Sarah Bache, her heirs and assigns, in manner following — that is to say — to my said daughter Sarah Bache, to have and enjoy the rents, issues, profits, income, and interest of the said last-mentioned one full seventh part or share <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>of the premises <em>for and during her natural </em>life, <em>and after her </em>deceaseThe trustees are then directed to convey to the children as before stated, or in case of the other contingencies to convey to her appointees by will.</p>
    <p id="b496-6" data-blocks='[["BL_496.4",496,[309,583,1165,377]]]'>It is clear, therefore, that these words have no effect in enlarging Mrs. Sergeant’s life estate to a fee simple, when the will of her father directly and positively negatives any such intention on his part. Richard Bache intended Mrs. Sergeant’s children and his grandchildren should have his property, and, therefore, Mrs. Sergeant in her lifetime could not legally convey more than her life interest, and her will so far as regarded this seventh had no operation, except so far as either of her children might elect to take under it.</p>
