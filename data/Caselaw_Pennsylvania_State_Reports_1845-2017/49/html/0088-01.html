Such being the case, performance could not be claimed by him against Corson : Bodine <em>v, </em>Glading, 9 Harris 53; Wilson <em>v. </em>Clark, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20555" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 555">1 W. &amp; S. 555</a>; Parish <em>v. </em>Koons, 1 Pars. 91; Pugh <em>v. </em>Good, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2062" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 62">3 W. &amp; S. 62</a>; Brightly’s Eq. 187; Elder <em>v. </em>Robinson, 7 Harris 364. The court below conceded that there must be mutuality, but avoids the effect of these rulings by holding that Mulvany, on the 28th of March 1864, made his election to take the property, which bound him to do so, and this cured the agreement, wherein before it was radically defective on the score of mutuality. As this action was founded upon and declared upon the written agreement, and not upon what Mulvany did subsequently thereto, can he recover otherwise than upon the agreement itself? He could not take all the chances between the 12th of December 1863 (date of agreement) and the 28th of March 1864, of its being an advantageous or disadvantageous purchase to him, without the other party having during the same period the same advantage. The court admitted that Mulvany was bound to nothing until March 28th, and if he had found no ore by that time, although he would have had the lot dug up, he would, <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>according to the reasoning of the court, have been under no obligation to take the property. It was, therefore, a one-sided agreement until it suited Mulvany to take it, there being no stipulation in the agreement that he was to have the right to elect to take or not take it between its date and April 1st 1864, and in truth he never did elect to take it without the joinder of the wife in the deed, until the day of trial in court, although he had written notice on the 21st of March 1864, that she refused to sign the deed. We have been unable to find a ease where a chancellor would enforce specific performance under -such circumstances. This court has certainly never so decided in any of their reported cases.</p>

This position was conceded in the court below, and in order to avoid the effect of the same, Mulvany on the trial offered to take the deed without the wife’s joining. Now, even if it be true that the party may do so, yet in no case can it be shown that the vendor was bound to take a mortgage for part of the purchase-money on such a title. If, therefore, Mulvany had offered to pay in cash the whole purchase-money at the time of the trial, it may be that he had the right to take the deed as he proposed to do. But as he offered and insisted upon our taking the mortgage, it could only be on the interest conveyed by Hiram Corson alone. The agreement contemplated a mortgage upon a clear fee in the land.

The only question of any importance presented upon the paper-book of the plaintiff in error is completely set at rest by the notice given by Mr. Mulvany to Dr. Corson on the 28th of March. His determination of the option to which he was entitled under the agreement, fixed him as perfectly as if the original contract had contained no such option. The two writings became one instrument. See Kerr <em>v. </em>Day, 2 Harris 112, and the authorities there referred to. It is there said to be definitively settled by a train of uncontroverted authorities that equitable conversion takes place, although the election to purchase rests solely with the purchaser, whose optional right may be transmitted to his vendee, &amp;c., and it was decided that the assignee of the equitable interest of the vendee “ entitled himself to a conveyance of the land by his notice of an election to purchase within the time stipulated by the covenant.” <em>A fortiori </em>is the vendee himself so entitled. Under the head of Mutuality of Consideration and Remedy, in Batten, ch. 5, p. 61, it is laid down that “ it is not considered requisite that an agreement should at the time be binding on both parties; it is sufficient if an agreement, signed by one party, be afterwards accepted and acted on by the other.” See also Palmer <em>v. </em>Scott, 1 R. &amp; M. 394, Dowell <em>v. </em>Dew, Younge &amp; Collyer 346, Stansbury <em>v. </em>Fringer, 11 Gill &amp; Johns. 149, and Western Railroad <em>v. </em>Babcock, <a href="/mass/47/0346-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="6 Met. 346" data-case-ids="9454146" data-case-paths="/mass/47/0346-01">6 Met. 346</a>.

Wilson <em>v. </em>Clark, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0554-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 554" data-case-ids="1852513" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0554-01">1 W. &amp; S. 554</a>, was a case of a parol contract, and therefore within the Statute of Frauds, and was decided expressly on the ground “ that no memorandum of the bargain has been put in writing, or signed by either party.” Pugh <em>v. </em>Good decides that delivering possession of land in pursuance of a parol contract, amounts to part performance, and either party may insist on its specific execution. Graham <em>v. </em>Pancoast was a case of fraud, gross inadequacy of price, and other circumstances of suspicion. The bill was not for specific performance, but for rescission of the contract. In Elder <em>v. </em>Robinson, a lessor stipulated with his lessees in the lease, that when the lands were offered for sale, the first offer should be made to them on terms as favourable as the lands should be offered to any other person. Held that this stipulation gave the lessees no title or interest in the land, but created only a personal obligation. , There was no offer to purchase at any price nor the tender of any money, nor was there a time limited in the agreement nor a price specified.</p>

The court there say, “ the dispute between the parties arises about the south boundary of the plaintiff’s land, which is the defendant’s northern boundary;” and thus the very point to be settled by the jury was left uncertain. The court remark : “ If the jury had found for the plaintiff by a straight line from the maple to the chestnut corner, as they doubtless intended, it would have been sufficient, for this could have been made certain.” The certainty required is such as will enable the sheriff to deliver possession. Here the property is bounded by a public road leading from Marble Hall to Spring Mill, and by lands of Joseph Freas, Daniel Freas, and James Sampson. This was accurately set forth in the writ and declaration, and the correctness of the description was proved by Bisbing, and by the deed from Lentz and wife to Dr. Corson, under which the latter held title, which described the lot by metes and bounds.</p>

His whole case -is, that he agreed to sell his lot and defer the payment of $800 of the purchase-money for two years, on the security of a mortgage alone, and that within this time all the ore may be removed from his lot. This was a consequence plainly within his view, in making his contract. Its purpose was to test the lot for the presence of ore. His object was to do this at Mulvany’s expense, and if ore were found, to obtain a higher price for his lot. Mulvany was willing to do this, provided, if he found ore, he should have a right to purchase. These are the manifest inferences to be drawn from t'he contract itself. Now, after ore has been discovered in the fifth and last shaft, he asks Mulvany to be turned away without obtaining the very thing which induced him to expend his means in experimenting'.

Both parties have signed and sealed-this agreement, arid the language of the instrument clearly imports a covenant on part of Mulvany to pay the purchase-money, if he elects to purchase. The language of a writing may be wholly that of a vendoi*, yet the vendee’s sealing or accepting it will bind him, and whether the action against him should be case or covenant is not material: Dubbs <em>v. </em>Finley, <em>2 </em>Barr 397; McFarson’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20504" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="1 Jones 504">1 Jones 504</a>-10; Campbell <em>v. </em>Shaw, <a href="/watts/3/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="3 Watts 60" data-case-ids="1841271" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0060-01">3 Watts 60</a>; Cott <em>v. </em>Selden, 5 Id. 525; Meade <em>v. </em>Weaver, 7 Barr 330, 331.

To assert the negative is simply to deny the power of making a conditional contract, and of declaring that performance shall take place when the contingency happens. If one contracts to purchase a vessel at sea upon her safe arrival in port, no one will dispute that an obligation to deliver on one side, and to pay on the other, arises upon her safe arrival. The vessel may never arrive, and the contract is not absolute to performance on either side till the contemplated contingency occurs; <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>but the contract is binding, and only awaits the event, to become binding also to performance.</p>

The uncertainty which attends the contingency exists in either case. The vessel may not arrive, or the party may not elect, but if either event takes place, the contingency has occurred. A choice or an election is but a fact, and wherein does it differ from any other fact made the condition of performance ? The agreement is mutual. One says, I will sell if you conclude to purchase; the other says, I will pay if I do conclude to purchase. He then resolves and says, I have concluded. The contingency upon which performance was rested has happened. Why are not both bound ? One would think 'it a plain case of mutual obligation, to perform on the happening of the event which was fixed as the condition of performance. The buyer tenders his money, and, clearly, the seller is bound to receive it. By the very offer to pay, the purchaser not only recognises the obligation of his previous assent to the contract, but the happening also of the fact on which his obligation to perform rested. The offer or tender is not itself the election, it is but the consequence of it. Election and notice of it precede the tender.</p>

It is said, But, if the seller refuse to accept the tender, the purchaser may retract; he is not bound, and of course the remedy is not mutual. But the fallacy lies in this; he is not bound, not because no obligation to perform arose in bis election, but because he sets up the seller’s breach of contract by refusal, as a discharge of the obligation. The obligation was there, but because the seller chose not to recognise it, the purchaser now chooses to be discharged from it.</p>

Therefore, it is said, there can be no obligation without the consent of the other. This loses sight of two facts: first, that a previous assent has been given; and second, that the party-notified of the election has no right to dissent. The party is already bound to accept performance, when the election shall be made, and when made his previous assent attaches. He may refuse, it is true, but it is not to decline a proposition, but to refuse performance of a bargain. If it were the initiation óf a new contract, as if one should voluntarily offer me his bond, he would not become my debtor until I accept it.

The title passed into Day, a purchaser from the lessors, and the lease into the hands of a second assignee of the tenant. The first assignee gave notice of his election to Day, the purchaser. The opinion of this court was delivered by Bell, J., holding that the title vested upon notice of the election in equity, and operated as a conversion of the lessor’s estate, into personalty, that the election by the assignee was good against the- alienee-of the lessors, and he became liable to specific performance, and, moreover, was bound to take notice of 'the right of election contained in the lease. Kerr <em>v. </em>Day has this feature to weaken it, that the instalments were not defined in the agreement,-but left to be settled at a period not exceeding ten years.

They were clear cases of a want of mutuality, where the Statute of Frauds in the one, and abandonment'of the contract in the other, caused the agreement to be not binding. Admitting to the fullest extent the doctrines of these two cases, that want of mutuality is a bar to specific performance, either upon a bill in equity or an ejectment, <a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>we are of opinion there is no want of mutuality in the contract between these parties.</p>
    <p id="b101-4" data-blocks='[["BL_101.4",101,[165,519,1164,216]]]'>We see no error in the fifth assignment. It is in the power of a party to waive full performance, and accept such title as the vendor is able to give. Mulvany’s waiver, therefore, of a release of dower by Corson’s wife, took away the force of the objection that she refused to sign a conveyance.</p>
    <p id="A8O" data-blocks='[["BL_101.5",101,[164,735,1166,602]]]'>The sixth error raises the question, whether the common law remedy by ejectment, used as a means of specific performance, is taken away by the grant of equity powers to the Courts of Common Pleas. Clearly, the legislature did not intend to take away common law actions by a grant of equity jurisdiction. The Act of 1806, providing that when a statutory remedy is given it must be pursued, does not apply. The law refers to specific remedies given for special cases. But the grant of equity jurisdiction is simply a grant of certain general equity powers in addition to powers already existing, and not in exclusion. It is rather a novel idea that equity, which is admitted to moderate the law, is to supersede it altogether. It is not necessary to notice the remaining assignments of error in detail; it is sufficient to say that in none of them do we discover any error.</p>
