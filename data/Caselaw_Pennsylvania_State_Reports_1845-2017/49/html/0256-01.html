    <p id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.4",261,[200,503,1166,731]]]'>This might have constituted an unlimited power of appointment had it not been for the following qualifying sentence:— “But in case the said Eliza should survive the said Ralph, then in trust for the said Eliza, her heirs and assigns in fee simple for ever.” Ralph McOlintoek died before his wife, and with him died his power, for by express terms, if that contingency happened, a fee was at once to become vested in her. The reading of the power proposed by the plaintiffs in error has nothing to support it. Sometimes the meaning of an instrument is rendered clear by the transposition of words or sentences, but it is not a transposition here, for the superadded words to these, “ but in case the said Eliza should survive the said Ralph, <em>Tie having made no </em>appointment,” are neither in form nor substance in the deed. The intention to leave the estate where it meritoriously belonged after the decease of the husband is clear in the terms used; and the reason for it is equally apparent, namely, that the estate was acquired solely by the wife’s money.</p>
