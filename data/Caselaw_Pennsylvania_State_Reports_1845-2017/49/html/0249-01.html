Desertion is an actual abandonment of matrimonial cohabitation, with an intent to desert, wilfully and maliciously persisted in without cause for two years. The guilty intent is manifested when, without cause or consent, either party withdraws from the residence of the other.</p>

Thus where, on the inability of a husband to support his wife they separate voluntarily, and she returns to her relatives, the separation is not a wilful and malicious desertion on his part, such as will entitle her to a divorce, though he had not visited her, and for a length of time had ceased to write to her, or answer her letters.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b252-6" data-blocks='[["BL_252.4",252,[286,511,1161,1240]]]'>The libel set forth the marriage of the parties on the 5th of August 1858, and the good conduct of libellant. That libellant left her husband in Philadelphia to visit her relatives in New York, on or about July 1st 1859, remaining there until the month of October 1860, when she returned to Philadelphia to reside with her grandfather. That said going to and remaining with her relatives in New York, and with her grandfather in Philadelphia, were with the consent of her husband, and in consequence of his inability or unwillingness to support her, and that he visited and wrote to her during the period of said visits, and was received by her. That during March 1861, with same consent and for same reason, libellant visited her relatives in Jersey City, from whence, in July 1861, she made a visit to her father in New York city, with whom she remained until February 29th 1864. That after libellant went to Jersey City, during March 1861, her husband continued for a time to write to her, but less frequently, until on or about the 9th of September* 1861, when he finally ceased to write to her altogether. That the last letter of the respondent was replied to by libellant in the same spirit of affection and kindness in which she had always written to and regarded him. That from September 9th 1861, until the date of the libel (21st April 1864), libellant had no communication from or with her said husband of any nature whatsoever. That libellant was always anxious and willing to live and cohabit with her husband. She therefore alleged desertion for more than two years, viz., from September 9th 1861 to the date of libel; and further showing, that parties are both citizens and residents of Pennsylvania, pray process and a decree divorcing her from the bond of matrimony as if she had never been married.</p>
