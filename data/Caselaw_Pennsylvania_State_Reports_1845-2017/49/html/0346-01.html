The defendant’s position was, that as an action of trover and conversion had been brought to recover for one hundred and fifty thousand feet of lumber, and a judgment had been obtained for the value of six thousand feet, it was not competent to show by evidence the ground of the recovery — the whole having been claimed in the <em>narr., </em>the plaintiff was estopped from recovering the value of the other one hundred and forty-four thousand feet upon the contract.</p>

If he neglected to do this, and, much more, if he suppressed the facts within his knowledge, contributing thereby to the defeat of the plaintiff, it is inequitable that he should be permitted to set up a judgment rendered comparatively fruitless by such neglect or suppression as a defence against his employer, when called upon for the performance of his contract.</p>

That suit was an action of trover and conversion for the same lumber for which this suit was brought,-and the effect of a recovery of damages by the plaintiff was to vest in Campbell the property in the lumber converted, and of course Converse could not recover against Colton for the same lumber for which Campbell had paid him. This, not on the ground of estoppel, but of title. If A. bail his chattel to B., who loses it, and C. finds it, and A. sues C. for it in trover, and recovers its value, the chattel becomes the property of C., and A. cannot assert title to it as against B. or any one else.

If, as is alleged, it was proved on that trial, that Campbell kept an accurate account of the logs taken from the boom and sawed at his mill, and that they amounted to not more than six or seven thousand feet, board measure, Colton himself being a witness and fully examined, and the arbitrators made their award on that evidence, giving Converse compensation for only six or seven thousand feet of his lumber, how could these facts be better established than by one of the arbitrators ? It was not in the nature of evidence in chief, else Campbell or his bookkeeper would have been the proper witness. But Colton had already given the award in evidence, and also the declaration in trover on which it was founded, and Donaldson the arbitrator was called to rebut it. Unexplained, that record imported that Converse had recovered against Campbell for one hundred and fifty thousand feet, board measure; explained as proposed, its effect would be limited to six or seven thousand feet.

    <p id="b354-6" data-blocks='[["BL_354.4",354,[263,593,1167,1504]]]'>It is to be borne in mind that Colton could not use that record by way of estoppel, for he was not a party to it, but it was competent for him to show by the record that Converse had. been paid for his lumber by Campbell, and that his title thereto had vested in Campbell. If, however, it were placed on the law of estoppel, an award or judgment is an estoppel only as to the matters adjudicated or which might have been legally adjudicated. Campbell could not have been legally charged in that action with any more logs than he converted. Evidence, therefore, which tended to define how many he converted was competent even to limit the effect of an estoppel. When the cause of action in which a previous judgment has been rendered was entire, and therefore insusceptible of severance or apportionment, the estoppel will extend to the whole, and it cannot be shown that any part of that which was laid in the <em>narr. </em>was withheld from the jury, but when .the cause of action was severable in its nature, although it will be presumed, <em>primé </em>facie,. that the judgment includes the whole, this presumption may be rebutted by clear evidence that it extends only to a part: Goddard <em>v. </em>Seldon, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Conn.%20521" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="7 Conn. 521">7 Conn.

The question whether the same matters might have been litigated in both actions must be determined solely by the record: Campbell <em>v. </em>Butts, 3 Comstock 173; but if it shows that they could, then the fact that they were actually decided may, and often must, be proved by extrinsic evidence: Young <em>v. </em>Rummell, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Hill%20478" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Hill 478">2 Hill 478</a>; Carmony <em>v. </em>Hoover, 5 Barr 305. If such be the law of strict estoppel by matter of record, it seems to follow, <em>a fortiori, </em>that on a mere" question of <em>title </em>the court should have limited the effect of the award to the quantity of lumber actually adjudicated, and in so far as the answers to the points came short of this, there was error. The answers, however, were predicated of the evidence admitted, and would probably have conformed to the rule here stated had Donaldson’s evidence been in. The great error of the trial, therefore, consisted in rejecting that evidence.</p>
