Mast wanted the judgment paid, and was constantly complaining that Berg had not paid it, and importuning him to pay it; and he ceased complaining and importuning only when further complaints and importunities were rendered useless by Berg’s claiming the benefit of the stay law.

The record does not show that Schnitzel bound himself for both defendants — it only shows the note of his obligation. The fair inference would be, perhaps, that he was bound for both, though as the record showed Mast to be only a surety, it would be no unreasonable construction that Schnitzel bound himself for the debt, and therefore only for the debtor. But to explain a doubtful implication from a record, and to reduce it to a matter of fact, is not to contradict the record. Whatever might be the meaning of the record, by itself, there is no doubt about its meaning in view of the facts found by the auditor, and as little doubt that the well-settled rule of law should be applied.</p>
