If this argument holds good, then it matters not whether the mother has bastard children by the same father, or a dozen or more by as many different fathers. A woman while in her youth, and walking in the paths of rectitude and virtue, may have had offspring born in lawful wedlock, afterwards falling from this estate, and giving birth to children out of lawful wedlock, the argument of the appellant would place on one common level the children of her lawful husband with a brood of illegitimates of all descriptions, and it may be of all colours. What a commentary would such a scene invoke upon the laws of a country claiming to be civilized, professing the Christian religion, and upholding the sanctity of the nuptial tie! Among moralists the institution of marriage is sustained and encouraged because it tends to the encouragement of industry, to the comfort of individuals, and the peace, welfare, and better government of society. The common law, which declares bastards incapable of inheriting, doubtless was instituted upon higher principles than the mere interest of individuals, and most probably was intended to render illicit commerce between the sexes odious and discreditable by stamping disgrace and disabilities upon the fruits of it. Notwithstanding all this, we have now placed before us a serious argument, the immediate tendency of which is to favour a free and unlawful commerce among the sexes, and grounded upon a statute which it is said can have but one construction, to wit, that thereafter there shall be no distinction between the good and the bad, no incentive to purity and virtue, and that the legislature of Pennsylvania has solemnly <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>declared by its statute law that fornication, bastardy, adultery, and incest shall or may be indirectly fostered and encouraged. Again: if the argument of the appellant is sound, the statute in question is intended to regulate the distribution and descent of real and personal estate among legitimate and illegitimate children in the ascending as well as descending line, lineal as well as .collateral, and therefore a mother who dies intestate, leaving real and personal estate, the ancestors of the bastard, portion of her offspring, both lineal and collateral, would also be entitled in the ascending gradé, and yet the argument is silent, and fails to point out in what manner such a lineage could be traced.</p>

If the tendency of the act be to libertinism and a discouragement of marriage, it is a reason for its repeal, but we cannot interpolate terms unsupported by its language or its spirit. Before the Act of 1855, the difference between legitimate and illegitimate children, as to descendable property, was simply the capacity to inherit. The former were able and the latter unable to inherit. That act declared that illegitimate children should take and be known by the name of their mother, and they and their mother shall respectively have <em>capacity to talce or inherit </em>from each other personal estate as next of kin, and real estate as heirs in fee simple. The condition of the bastard is thus changed. Before, he was <em>filius nullius, </em>now he is next of kin and heir; before, he had no capacity or ability, now he has capacity to take or inherit. He is the son of his mother and she is his mother, so that now each may take or inherit from the other. The legislature has chosen to convey its meaning in these expressions which strike at the root of his disability by declaring his capacity. It has said that as between him and his mother he shall inherit her property, without proviso or qualification, as her heir. But how do heirs inherit? Certainly in the manner the law provides: — if one heir, solely; if more than one, together. How then can we say, when other heirs are also left, he shall not inherit, he shall not be an heir ? It is said another is born in lawful wedlock and therefore he shall not inherit. But in respect to inheritance from the same mother, one is as lawful as the other. As to her property neither is now illegitimate. Birth in lawful wedlock is no longer the criterion, but blood relationship. The bastard and the lawful child have now a like capacity. It would be clearly legislation on our part to say that when lawful children are born as well as bastards, the latter shall not have capacity to take from the common mother, when the law has said they shall.</p>

Indeed it may be questioned whether a single application to legitimate, at the instance of either of the parents, has ever been refused. The tendency of the law to immorality may also be well doubted. The fiery torrent of passion seldom stops to consider consequences. In its purpose the law looks only to the misfortune of the innocent offspring, who are compelled to bear in their persons the punishment due to a fault in which they did not share. While the law leaves them to the frown of society and the bitterness of shame, it is unwilling to add beggary to their misery by refusing them a share in the property of that one parent who is often more, sinned against than sinning, and whose mother’s heart yearns towards the child of her misfortune.</p>
