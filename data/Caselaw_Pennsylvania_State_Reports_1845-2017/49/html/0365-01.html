It was one of the first subjects that engaged the attention of the English chancellors, and, though violently resisted by common-law law,yers and judges, the power was largely exercised by Cardinal Wolsey in the reign of Henry VIII., and, according to Mr. Reeves, <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>with great ability and justice. It is related of Sir Thomas More, who succeeded Cardinal Wolsey, that, having invited the judges to dine with him, he showed them the number and nature, of the causes in which he had granted injunctions to judgments of the courts of common law; and the judges, upon full debate of the matters, confessed that they could have done no otherwise themselves. Still, however, clamors against the equity jurisdiction continued, until they culminated in the famous controversy in the reign of James I., which was conducted principally by Lord poke against, and by Lord Ellesmere in favor of, the chancery jurisdiction. The very point of this controversy, according to Judge Story (1 Story’s Equity, § 51), was whether a court of equity could give relief for or against a judgment at common law, and it was finally decided in favor of the equity jurisdiction. _ From that time down to this day the jurisdiction has been exercised in England, and decrees of ecclesiastical courts have often been relieved against on the ground of fraud: Van Brough <em>v. </em>Cock, 1 Chancery Cases 201; Bissel <em>v. </em>Axtell, 2 Vernon 47. And so in like manner have awards (Lord Lonsdale <em>v. </em>Littledale, 2 Ves. 451) and verdicts (Williams <em>v. </em>Lee, 3 Atk. 223 ; Bateman <em>v. </em>Willoe, 1 Scho. &amp; Lef. 201) and judgments at law (Barnsley <em>v. </em>Powell, 1 Ves. Sen. 119 ; Gainsborough <em>v. </em>Gifford, 2 P. Wms. 424; Humphreys <em>v. </em>Humphreys, 3 P. Wms. 394). And even decrees in chancery may be avoided for the same cause : Loyd <em>v. </em>Mansell, 2 P. Wms. 73 ; Galley <em>v. </em>Baker, Cases Temp. Talbot 201; Bradish <em>v. </em>Gee, Amb. 229. In. the above-cited case from 2 P. Wms., at page 246, the Master of the Rolls said such cases there are in which equity will relieve after a verdict in a matter where the defendant at law might properly have defended himself, as if plaintiff recovers a debt and defendant finds a receipt for the money recovered. In Humphreys <em>v. </em>Humphreys,, 3 P. Wms. 394, a son had sued his father at law on a bond, and recovered a judgment, against which an injunction was granted in chancery.</p>

The material point is that such principles do pervade our jurisprudence, and it is well they do, for they are only the dictates of natural justice and common sense. That wholesome maxim of the common law, that fraud vitiates whatever it touches, makes no exception of judgments at law. No court of justice will set aside or even be led to look into a solemn judgment on light or trivial grounds; but when it is alleged upon adequate proofs that a judgment in whole or in part has been obtained by a suppression of truth which it was the duty of the party to disclose or by the suggestion of a falsehood or by any of the infinite and therefore undefinable means by which fraud may be practised, no court will allow itself, its records, and the process of law to be used as instruments of fraud. It seemed to be thought, on the argument, that the judgment in this case, being founded upon an award of arbitrators, could be impeached only by proceeding under the Acts of Assembly regulating compulsory arbitrations, but the principle lies deeper than the form of the proceedings ; it goes to the very root of the evil when it deprives him of all benefit of his iniquity who has fraudulently employed legal process and judicial records to obtain an undue advantage over another.</p>

Sometimes a collateral issue has been directed to try disputed facts, sometimes execution-process has been controlled to promote the equity due to parties, but our favorite practice, and that which Ch.

Gibson commended in Gallup <em>v. </em>Reynolds, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20425" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="8 Watts 425">8 Watts 425</a>, has been to open the judgment without impairing its lien, and let the defendant in to defend upon the matters alleged in his affidavit of complaint. Our practice, said the Chief Justice in that case, is to try collusion by a collateral issue, but matter of defence by an issue in the cause. In Kellogg <em>v. </em>Krauser, 14 S. &amp; R. 143, Ch. J. Tilghman declared in 1826, that the practice of opening judgments entered on warrant of attorney, or of ordering a feigned issue, to ascertain necessary facts, had been undisputed for half a century, at least. In Kalbach <em>v. </em>Fisher, <a href="/rawle/1/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="1 Rawle 323" data-case-ids="1819319" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0323-01">1 Rawle 323</a>, a judgment had been entered in the Common Pleas of Berks county in 1820, upon warrant of attorney; a <em>soire facias </em>to revive it <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>and judgment thereon in 1825 ; and in 1827 a rule was obtained to open both the original judgment and that upon the <em>scire facias, </em>which was made absolute, and a trial had in 1828, which resulted in a verdict for the defendant. In delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, that no writ of error would lie to the opening of a judgment by the court below, Mr. Justice Rogers said: “ The power of the Court of Common Pleas, in relation to opening judgments, is most ample, and policy requires that it should be liberally used, otherwise great and manifest injustice would be the consequence, from the great variety of shapes which fraud may assume in the complicated transactions of men. It depends upon the sound discretion of the court, which must be regulated more by the particular circumstances of every case, than by any precise and known rule of law. In Huston <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 14 S. &amp; R. 307, it was ruled, that the Court of Common Pleas had no right to set aside a judgment entered upon a verdict without setting aside the verdict also.

We cannot treat him as a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser of the paper, for the jury found that he was not. Then he was a mere pledgee, and he must have known himself to be nothing more.

Now the inference is large enough that Cochran made these advances to Townsend in good faith and upon the credit of this paper, without pressing it so far as to make it an ordinary business transaction in which Cochran would stand as a purchaser of the paper from Townsend. Had he been such a purchaser, there would have been a reason for his taking an award for the full sum of the paper, for there might have been a liability over to Townsend; or, if none, it would have been because he had extinguished, Townsend’s interest and'held the paper as his own, and, of course, for all it expressed. But Townsend had no interest in the paper, and could call Cochran to no account by reason of it. The paper was made by Eldridge for his own use, and having permitted Cochran to make advances on the faith of it, he is bound to reimburse him, though no dollar of Cochran’s advances ever reached his hands; but beyond this he was under no duty to Cochran, and Cochran knew that this was the extent of his liability.</p>

He was probably aware of the fact also that Townsend had led Eldridge to believe that the object of the arbitration was to settle the dealings between themselves, Cochran and Townsend, and he certainly knew that Townsend was managing the arbitration, for he received a consideration from him for adjournments and extensions of the right of appeal.</p>

The verdict does exact justice to Cochran, supposing him a pledgee and not a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser of the paper, for it compels Eldridge to repay every dollar his agent received from Cochran on the credit of the paper he issued, but it prevents his using legal process, the award and judgment, to inflict the great wrong upon .Eldridge of making him pay nearly six thousand dollars which he never received and which Cochran never advanced. We think there was enough in the case to justify the submission, and as substantial justice was obtained we will affirm the judgment and proceedings.</p>
