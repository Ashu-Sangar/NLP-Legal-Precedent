Our first point asked to have this assignment declared inoperative and void as against ereditors not accepting it, because it undertook to assign partnership property for payment of individual debts. It conveys and transfers “ all the estate, real, personal, and mixed, of the grantors, including separate as well as partnership property, &amp;e., in trust to pay with the moneys therefrom the creditors of assignors, partly of the first part, their respective and just demands in full, if sufficient to satisfy, and if not sufficient to satisfy the same in full, then <em>pro rata </em>according to the respective amounts of the same, without preference as between individuals.” The parties of the first part were Peter Winters McFall, Joseph Martin, and Mary Matilda, wife of Peter Winters McFall. The latter, it is true, exempts her separate estate, and is said only to join for the purpose of barring her dower in real estate owned by her husband; but the direction as to distribution includes her creditors, if she had any, as well as the others, and her joining, as well as the inventory and records in evidence, showed that the real estate, appraised at $10,000, belonged to P.

The effect of this would be to either nullify the settled rules of law'above cited, or to produce that confusion and uncertainty that would delay, hinder, or defraud creditors. The true, safe, and proper course where partners, wish to make assignments of their separate and joint properties is to do so, as in Houseal &amp; Smith’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20484" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Wright 484">9 Wright 484</a>, by separate assignments, providing in each for the class of creditors to whom the law says the property should go.

Here one of the inventories filed show that the appraisers, at the request of the assignee, appraised and set apart as property exempted and reserved, three hundred dollars’ worth of the property assigned. We can see no difference whether the assignor puts down in the assignment the goods to amount of $300 he wishes to retain, as in Boker <em>v. </em>Crookshank, or whether, under an exception in the deed, the assignee has it done for .him. If a debtor considers that making an assignment is preferable to him than having his property taken upon compulsory process, he must take the law as he finds it. It is only upon compulsory process that the law allows him the $300 exemption. We claim that this reservation for the benefit of the assignors which they got avoids this deed against non-accepting creditors.</p>

In all these cases it was held that such unrecorded deed is of no avail against a creditor who obtains judgment and issues execution. But it was found that this requirement was not sufficient to prevent the evil of an assignment being made stopping the creditor from pursuing his rights, and the assignee folding his hands or converting the property into money, but giving no security that would protect the creditor. Hence the legislature deemed it necessary to make other provisions and requirements. And notwithstanding it had been decided, as in the case of Charles Shaw, assignee of Bickham, 1 Ashmead 382, that if the' assignee sold the property which passed to him under the assignment, before he filed the inventory and gave the security required by law, he was liable to citation and dismissal; that was found not sufficient, and the codifiers reported to the legislature the Act passed June 14th 1836, P. L. 630, making the same requirements as to filing inventory, and giving bond within the thirty days which had been required as to the recording the deed, and providing that “ the assignee or assignees as aforesaid shall, as soon as such inventory shall have been filed, give a bond or bonds with at least two sufficient sureties, to be approved of by one of the judges of the said court, in double the amount of the appraised value of the estate so assigned,” giving also the condition of the bond, and enacting that such bond “ shall be filed in the office of the prothonotary of the said court, and shall by him be entered of record, and shall enure to the use of all persons interested in the property assignedAct of June 14th 1836, §§ 1, 5, 6.

Great reliance is put upon the <em>obiter dictum </em>of Justice Sergeant, in Dallam <em>v. </em>Fitler, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20326" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 326">6 W. &amp; S. 326</a>, as to what, in his opinion, the remedy for neglect of filing bond and inventory <em>seemed </em>to be.

It is alleged by the plaintiff in error that this assignment was entirely null and void for several reasons, and first, because the bond was never approved. Now it is perfectly clear that the assignment operated from its date, and conveyed all the property assigned by it to the assignee, who accepted the trust, and who could have been compelled to execute a proper bond, or to be dismissed from the trust, and another assignee appointed in his place. “There would be plausibility,” says Judge Knox, “in the argument of the defendant in error, if it could first be shown that he was not a trustee or an assignee until he had given bond and filed his inventory; but the law is not so. The assignment takes effect upon the day of its execution and delivery, whereas the inventory may be filed within thirty days thereafter, and the bond <a id="p473" href="#p473" data-label="473" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*473</a>is to be given as soon as the inventory and appraisement shall be filed.

Under the law, therefore, as it stood before the Acts of 1843 and 1849, it was imperative under those circumstances, that the assignors should convey both their partnership and separate estates to their assignees. If, therefore, such an assignment was now made, which would have been invalid under the old law, all those preferences would be wiped out, and the assignment “ be held and construed to enure to the benefit of all the creditors in proportion to their respective demands.” This is a statutory provision, and shows the policy of the legislature. “The Act of 1843,” says Judge Lowrie, “ merely prohibits all preferences in assignments in trust for creditors; and since that act an assignment may be defined to be, a transfer by a debtor, of the whole or part of his effects, to some person in trust, to pay all his creditors in like proportions, and to return the surplus, if any, to the debtor :” Wiener <em>v. </em>Davis, 6 Harris 333.</p>

These partners say they are <a id="p474" href="#p474" data-label="474" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*474</a>unable to pay then* various creditors, but are desirous of distributing said estate among them according to their several equities, that is partnership property to pay partnership debts, separate property to pay separate debts.</p>
    <p id="b476-6" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[311,604,1166,988]]]'>The reasoning in Black’s Appeal has received elucidation by Lord Chancellor Westbury in Ex parte Topping, 12 Law T. Rep. 3, 11 Jurist N. S. 210, decided on the 11th February 1865. Speakipg of the doctrine of equity on this subject, he says: <em>“ </em>The right of proof under such circumstances is regulated by arbitrary rules which are derived from the principles of this court as to marshalling. They were embodied for the first time in the order of Lord Loughborough, made in the year 1794. By the effect of that order, separate accounts are kept of the joint estate and of the separate estate of each partner, and if there be any account of joint creditors, the joint creditors are not admitted to prove against the separate estate, but must wait until the separate creditors are paid, and then receive from the separate estate the. surplus only which remains. The consequence is, that it has been held that one partner cannot prove against his copartner, because, in ordinary cases, that proof would diminish the estate of the debtor partner, and thereby the partner, if admitted to prove, would come in competition with his own creditors, namely, the joint creditors, and detract to the extent of the proof from the benefit they would derive from the separate estate. Therefore, it has been laid down as a general rule, that a partner cannot be permitted to prove against the estate of his copartner.”</p>
    <p id="b476-7" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[308,1593,1163,515]]]'>In the case before him, the Lord Chancellor held this rule did not apply, because there was an undisputed private debt due from a partner to his copartner, and by no means did it appear possible that there could be any surplus of the partner’s estate, whether proof were admitted against it or not, although the joint debts were still in existence, and therefore proof by the copartner against his partner’s separate estate was admitted, subject to the proof being expunged in case a surplus should afterwards arise from the debtor partner’s estate. This decision operated directly in favour of the joint creditors, who would thus get the benefit of the dividend payable on this private debt, of which a literal application of the rule would have entirely deprived them.</p>
