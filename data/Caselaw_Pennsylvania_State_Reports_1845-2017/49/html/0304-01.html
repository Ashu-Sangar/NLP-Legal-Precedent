Colahan, Esq., who was appointed her guardian on the 15th of September, A. D. 1854, she then being seven years of age. That at the time of his appointment, security under the order of the court was entered by Christopher Fallon, Esq., in the sum of $28,000; that Mr. Fallon had since died insolvent, and that the estate was in consequence without any security whatever. Upon which state of facts she prayed permission to choose a guardian, nominating John P. Levy, Esq., as her choice in that behalf.

That the father of petitioner was Bernard McCann, and her mother Catherine McCann, both members of the Catholic church, deeply attached to its faith and worship, and anxious that their children should be brought up in the same faith and worship. The father died first, and the mother on the 24th July 1854, having made her last will and testament, which was duly admitted to probate, by which she appointed her father, Isaac Jones, and Mark Anthony Frenaye, executors, and bequeathed all her estate to her three children, and if any of them should die under full age unmarried and without issue, gave her share to the survivors of them, and if but one survivor, such survivor was to take the whole; and she appointed her father, Isaac Jones, and John B. Colahan, guardians of her children, adding these words: “ It is my will that my children be all brought up and educated as strict Roman Catholics, so that they may possess and be practical in the observance of the religion of their parents.”</p>

The appellant is a young lady of past seventeen years of age, and mentally quite as much matured as the majority of males become at twenty-one. In mind and temperament she is devotional, and has for some time been an earnest seeker after religious truth. Can it be that a stranger (for Mr. Colahan is no more), one not a kin to her, or connected with her family, can appear and control her wishes respecting her choice of his successor ?</p>
    <p id="b308-7" data-blocks='[["BL_308.7",308,[288,937,1160,429]]]'>The Orphans’ Court, it is submitted, are in error in supposing he can. The learned president judge conceded that the gentleman whom Miss McCann had chosen as her guardian was respectable, responsible, and fitted to intelligently carry out such a delicate trust; but he conceived that the 5th section of the Act of Assembly, approved March 29th 1832, was intended to extend to all applications for guardians, whether guardians appointed by the court, or guardians selected by the minor. This seems to be the pivot upon which the decision turns. The section of the act is as follows, viz.:—</p>
    <p id="b308-8" data-blocks='[["BL_308.8",308,[289,1369,1159,640]]]'>“ The Orphans’ Court of each county shall have the care of minors residing within such county, and of their estates, and shall have power to admit such minors, when and as often as there shall be occasion to make choice of guardians — and to appoint guardians of such as they shall adjudge too young, or otherwise incompetent to make choice for themselves: Provided, that persons of the same religious persuasion as the parents of the minors shall in all cases be preferred by the court in their appointments, and such appointments or admission of a guardian of the Orphans’ Court of the county in which such minor resides, shall have like effect in every other county.” Legislative acts are to be interpreted according to the intention of the legislature apparent on their face: Wilkinson <em>v. </em>Leland, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Pet.%20662" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Pet. 662">2 Pet. 662</a>. The distinction between the “ appointment” by the court and the choice by the minor is thus carefully maintained.</p>
    <p id="b308-9" data-blocks='[["BL_308.9",308,[290,2009,1158,172]]]'>The preference for the element of religious coincidence between the parents and the proposed guardian is to be that of the “court” in its “ appointment,” but there is no such restriction placed upon the “ choice” of the infant.</p>

    <p id="b309-6" data-blocks='[["BL_309.4",309,[160,534,1164,646]]]'>I take this view of the act by looking at it in the light of the federal and state constitutions. It is in harmony with the assertion that “ all men have a natural and indefeasible right to worship God according to the dictates of their own conscience,” and that “ no human authority can, in any case whatever, control or interfere with the rights of conscience.” Otherwise the act would be unconstitutional, for not only is a legislative act opposed to a constitutional provision invalid, but that “ which opposes a constitutional principle also is void:” Van Horne <em>v. </em>Dorrance, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Dall.%20Rep.%20308" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Dall. Rep. 308">2 Dall. Rep. 308</a>. Absolute religious liberty is the seminal principle of our institutions. We find it in the Constitution of the United States; in the Constitution of Pennsylvania ; in the charter granted to George Calvert, Lord Baltimore; in Protestant Rhode Island, and in our own state, in the charter of privileges prepared by William Penn. .</p>
    <p id="b309-7" data-blocks='[["BL_309.5",309,[160,1175,1166,483]]]'>Under the Act of 1832, in the matter of “ appointments” of guardians by the court, while the minor is under fourteen years, the court should select some person of the religious belief of the infant’s parents; but that when that age is passed, their duty is to “admit” the minor to select any otherwise competent person he or she chooses, without reference to their religious belief. Nicholson’s Appeal, 8 Harris 56, recognises the principle we invoke in determining that in the absence of restraint upon the minor’s conscience a difference of religious opinion is not a sufficient cause to remove a guardian. See also Lee’s Appeal, 3 Casey 229; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Farley, 4 Penna. Law J. 396.</p>

Ex parte Krause is irrelevant. It was a question of summary commitment under a jurisdiction duly created by Act of Assembly. Senseman’s Appeal sustains our right of appeal, for the question here involved is a pure question of law. Graham’s Appeal also relates to minors under fourteen years of age, and the legal discretion defined includes among its elements the orphan’s own approval and the selection of a person of the orphan’s own faith. <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>Besides, the construction claimed by the appellee would compel the appellant to “attend and support” an establishment where religious rites opposed to those of .the faith entertained by the minor form a part of the educational discipline, in contravention of the 3d section of the Bill of Rights of Pennsylvania.</p>

Yet the Act of Assembly cited by the appellant must have been passed with the purpose that his influences in choosing a school for her, &amp;e., should favour the education of the ward in the religious persuasion of her parents. If the act be wrong, it is for the legislature to alter or repeal it, not for the court to disregard it. But it is an act that commends itself to.the heart of every parent, that all influences properly exerted shall tend in the direction of preserving the child in the religious persuasions of her parents. This does not require coercion, and here none was used.</p>
