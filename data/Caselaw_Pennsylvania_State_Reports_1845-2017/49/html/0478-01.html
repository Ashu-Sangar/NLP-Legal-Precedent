The word is not novel in our legislation; the insolvent laws have had it since 1886, for the section then passed and re-enacted in”the 131st section of the Penal Code of 1860, provides for the punishment of any petitioner who had applied to his own use any money or property with which he had. been intrusted as bailee, <em>agent, </em>or depositary, &amp;c. So, too, in sections 130 and 134, it is a crime, under certain circumstances, to act as scrivener, broker, <em>agent, </em>or witness, and the word so often used in the criminal law, should have an uniform interpretation. Throughout the legislation of the state the word is found; appeals from awards of arbitrators, affidavits for writs of error, and many other things are, by law, allowed to be done by agents <em>eo nomine ; </em>and it seems a perversion of terms to regard an agency as a permanent business, each employment being separate, and the employed being the party’s agent for the particular purpose. There can be no such thing really as a professional agent. The word agent, closely sounding like its primitive <em>agens, </em>is one acting for another. In this section it is intended to enumerate the classes of persons subject to prosecution for flagrant breaches of trust. A banker, a broker, a merchant, an attorney (perhaps an attorney in fact as well as attorney at law), receives property by virtue of his calling, but an agent receiving property for safe custody, should certainly not have immunity for dishonesty, worse generally than in him who has mingled the property of another with his own, and has not afterwards the power to separate it. With the latter the crime may be venial; with the former, never so, as the conversion is always intended and for personal gain.
