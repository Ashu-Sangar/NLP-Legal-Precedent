The corner lot afterwards passed successively to five different owners, the last of whom is the defendant Martin, and in all the deeds the same condition is repeated; so that Martin himself in 1858 purchased on these express terms. Of the adjoining lot, Alexander Henry died seised, and in 1851, his testamentary trustee conveyed it to the plaintiff Clark ; and the rent reserved on the corner lot by Henry was purchased by Martin in 1860. Our question is, has Clark as owner of the adjoining lot, any such right to the condition or terms imposed upon Martin’s title as entitles him to claim in equity that Martin shall he compelled to observe them ? We think he has.</p>
