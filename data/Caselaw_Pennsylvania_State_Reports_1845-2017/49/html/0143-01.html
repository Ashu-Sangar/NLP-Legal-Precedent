Under an order of Orphans’ Court the administrators of Leib sold the ground-rent to Thomas Dixcy, the plaintiff’s testator, and made return of the sale 19th March 1858, on which day the Orphans’ Court confirmed the sale, and ordered the administrators to give the security required by law in the sum of $4500. The next day Dixcy paid over $3400, the full consideration of his purchase, and took a deed from the administrator, duly executed and acknowledged, and which was recorded on the 9th of April, and after this the defendant paid the rent regularly to Dixcy, until the heirs of Leib, about the 1st of January 1862, gave him notice that Dixcy’s title was invalid and void in law, in consequence of the omission of the administrators to enter the security ordered by the Orphans’ Court on the 19th March 1858.

    <p id="b146-7" data-blocks='[["BL_146.5",146,[291,1281,1166,427]]]'>It is sufficient for the purposes of this suit to say that if the decree of the 19th of March was void for want of the prescribed security, it cannot be declared void in this collateral action.

The law, when it assumes custody of a debtor’s or decedent’s real estate, and converts it into money, is supposed to follow the money to its appropriate destination, and the purchaser is excused from this duty.</p>

But without such liability on his part, it is very clear that the affidavit disclosed no defence.</p>
