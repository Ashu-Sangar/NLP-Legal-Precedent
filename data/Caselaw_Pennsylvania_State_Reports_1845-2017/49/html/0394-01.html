The Allentown Bank brought suit against him September 19th 1859, which was arbitrated. Shortly before obtaining the award, a large number of judgments were entered up against Hower, in the prothonotary’s office of said county, upon amicable actions and confessions dated October 10th 1859. Four of these judgments were entered up November 30th, A. D. 1859, viz., one in favour of Beck &amp; Heiny, the above plaintiffs, for $8000; one in favour of Thomas Beck for $9064.12; one in favour of Thomas Beck for $3100; and one in favour of Aaron Solt for $1000. The alleged consideration of these judgments was indebtedness to Mr. Beck and liability of Beck &amp; Heiny as endorsers. The others, twenty-six in number, were entered up December 10th 1859 in favour of various creditors of Hower. December 12th 1859, a <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued upon the judgment of Beck &amp; Heiny, and placed in the hands of Thomas Heckman, then sheriff, who made no levy under it, filled up six handbills from information given him by Hower, the defendant in execution, put up one in his own office and gave five others to Hower, but did not go to the place where the property was until the day fixed for sale (the store remaining open and sales going on as before), and sold goods and chattels to the amount of $2825.22, the plaintiffs in the execution being the only purchasers. Hower continued to live upon the property with his family, kept the tavern as before, and carried on the business of store, tavern, and distillery. There was no change of sign, although it was given out that the store business was in Beck &amp; Heiny’s name. Hower lived out of and from the store, tavern, mill, and farm without accounting or paying anything over to Beck &amp; Heiny from the proceeds. No settlement was made with them, nor was any account of moneys kept by Hower, the title to the real estate, so far as the records showed, remaining unchanged. On the 15th of April 1863 the mill and distillery were destroyed by fire. <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>There was a neighbourhood meeting on the property, at which it was agreed to solicit contributions to assist Hower to rebuild the mill. Beck &amp; Heiny wore present. Subscriptions were ordered, and subsequently procured. To each was the following heading: “We, the undersigned, promise to give the sums opposite our names, to assist Adam Hower, Esq., of Ilowersville, Lehigh township, Northampton county, to rebuild his mill, which was destroyed by fire on the night of the 15th of April last,” &amp;c.</p>

The levy was made upon certain products of the farm and upon goods and chattels in Hower’s possession on said property. He had $211.25 of these goods appraised to him under the Exemption Law. The residue, being those set forth in the feigned issue, were claimed by Beck &amp; Heiny as their property, and this issue was directed to try their right to so claim as against the Allentown Bank, an execution-creditor of Hower.</p>

On cross-examination he testiied that “ he did not receive any money at the time he delivered the deeds; received no papers from either Beck or Heiny the day he delivered the'deeds; that no agreement was made the day he delivered them, but had been before; no credit given on any paper at the time that he gave the deed to Heiny in Hower’s house, and took Beck’s deed to him ; that no credit was endorsed on Beck &amp; Heiny’s judgment or on Beck’s judgments; that nothing was said as to how the balance over the liens, which were before Beck &amp; Heiny’s judgment, was to be distributed on the judgments in favour of Beck &amp; Heiny, Beck and Solt; and that the judgments were all entered on the same day and were yet open on the docket.” Hower further said on cross-examination: “ Beck said if I would go away they would have nothing to do with it. I must look out for myself. If I stayed they would try to help me.” Beck produced in court the notes given him by Iiower, alleged to be part consideration of his judgment but without credit or payment endorsed.</p>

Adam Hower was indebted to insolvency. Did not put his name on paper because he considered it of no use. He had a tavern, store, quantity of store goods, grist-mill, distillery, and farm of some ninety odd acres. Was thus situated in 1859. While thus circumstanced, Beck &amp; Heiny had an execution issued, and, by virtue of an execution placed in the hands of Sheriff Heckman, the property in this store was sold and bid off by Beck &amp; Heiny. It is alleged by defendant that when this execution was placed in the sheriff’s hands no actual levy was made. It seems to have been so. There was a memorandum given the sheriff by Hower of what was to be levied and sold. Without going to the property, the sheriff took the statement of <em>the </em>defendant of what his property was. He (the sheriff) put up one advertisement of sale. Hower took the others on the day of sale. Sheriff Heckman went up, and went through the sale as testified. As far as relates to plaintiff and defendant in that execution, their acquiescing in such sale would be good. As far as relates to other execution-creditors having executions, that might be different. But it does not appear that there were any other execution-creditors at that time, and that question does not enter into the case. But we leave it to the jury to say <a id="p401" href="#p401" data-label="401" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*401</a>■whether the sale thus made was all a contrivance against the other creditors of Hower. If Beck &amp; Heiny had a <em>bond fide </em>judgment and execution, &amp;c., so far as plaintiff and defendant are concerned it would be binding just the same as a private sale. But, even as a private sale, it would be good as between them and Hower.” [The court here referred to and read the testimony.] <em>“ </em>These circumstances did not make it fraudulent, and so far as the parties to the sale were concerned it would be good. It was an informal sale merely. But mere informality does not vitiate. If this judgment was not good, not founded on a good consideration, it would be fraudulent. There is no evidence that the judgment -was not good and sufficient, and it is not pretended that the judgment was not for a good consideration. The property sold remained in store. Same clerks, same owner apparently in charge, and no visible change of possession.</p>

In order to relieve the case from that embarrassment the deeds were given in evidence for the property on which the store stands, &amp;e., one deed to each of the plaintiffs for different parcels of the land. These were given in evidence to show a change of the possession, for any other purpose immaterial, except to show that a change of possession was immediately effected. That is a controlling point in cases of the kind which takes it from the court as a question of law and gives it to the jury as a question of fact. These deeds have been given in evidence, and purport to have been executed for a consideration. ■ The deeds on their face appear all right and fair. It is alleged that the deeds were executed for a consideration less than the value of the land, and two or three witnesses called by defendant say the consideration mentioned is less than the value. If this were true, the deeds would not be void for that. It is alleged by the defendant that the consideration was not paid. Hower said in his testimony no money was paid. That would not make the deeds void. If, as said by plaintiff, that the consideration of these deeds was based upon Hower’s indebtedness tó Beck <em>&amp; </em>Heiny, and was also subject to the mortgages. Is this true ? Was the deed executed upon good and sufficient consideration ? If good, was there a change of possession ? Upon that we have the testimony of Hower. He had appointment as steward of poor house (reads the testimony). They (Beck &amp; Heiny) had a perfect right to make such a contract with Hower, if it was truthful; they might as well employ Hower as any other person, and he had a right to go in possession, and the whole contract, if not made for a cover, would be <em>bond fide </em>between the parties. The deeds were not recorded. It is always in good taste to put deeds on record. Parties run risks if they do not. But it is not a <a id="p402" href="#p402" data-label="402" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*402</a>necessity. Then the question recurs whether this was a fictitious arrangement and Hower kept there under it. We are asked to pronounce the deeds fraudulent. But we do not and will not take the facts from the jury, and that question can be tried otherwise, by issuing, execution and levying on the land,’and trying the title by ejectment. We will not take the facts from the jury. If this arrangement was made to keep Hower in possession in defiance of his creditors, it would not do. One controlling question is the <em>bond fide </em>consideration of the judgments. Is there any evidence to satisfy you that Hower was not indebted to plaintiffs? When a transaction is based on a good consideration and untainted by fraud, the law sustains it, and when it is based on a past consideration, as between debtor and creditor, there is no room for impeaching it unless greatly inadequate. A debtor can give a judgment or deed to creditors in security or payment of the indebtedness. Indebtedness ought to be paid. There are higher equities with some creditors. For instance, a man who had sold property to his debtor at three times its value ought not in equity to be preferred to a widow who had loaned him all her money without security. It is the impulse of the heart to pay in preference the more meritorious. The law would be a tyrant and robber if it did not permit a preference in payment. A man may thus prefer one creditor to another. The plaintiffs here might be preferred; and if the jury find all right, all honest, they ought to save them. But otherwise, not. They have taken possession and exercised ownership.</p>

The complaint of plaintiff in error is, that the transactions between Beck &amp; Heiny and Hower have not been declared a fraud. The tribunal whose especial function it was to pronounce upon such questions has decided against them, and they are without remedy unless this court can be induced to assume the functions of a jury, and judicially declare that, upon all the evidence in the cause, there ivas an intent to hinder, delay, and defeat the Allentown Bank. The court below refused to do this, referring the whole question to the jury. Still dissatisfied, they propose that this court shall do what the jury and Common Pleas declined doing, and pronounce a judgment upon the facts, providing it be a judgment in their favour. Conscious that this court only decides legal questions, they strive at some stages of their argument to give the question the aspect of a legal one by proposing that all the facts, taken together, shall be held to constitute a fraud in law. This inconsistency becomes manifest the moment one examines the argument in detail. The expression <em>fraud in law </em>is applicable to the case of a retention of possession of chattels by a vendor who has sold them by a private sale to another. The legitimate scope of the argument would be to show that there ■was such a retention of possession in this case. But our friends are not content to pursue this line of argument. They argue the entire question of a fraudulent intent in the parties, which is a pure question for the jury; and they enumerate all the facts, real and imaginative, which, in their view, indicate the presence of a design to hinder and delay their client. We cannot think that the court will entertain that sort of argument.</p>

Rep. 481. But the plaintiffs in error respond to our reply by saying that the sheriff’s sale was void for informality ; which alleged informalities are, that there was no sufficient levy, no proper advertisement, and that the goods were sold in too large quantities.</p>

Sheriff Heckman made his levy by obtaining from the defendant a list of the goods, which he adopted as correct and treated as his levy. He did not go to the place where the goods were on the day he made it, and not until the the day of the sale, seven days after. The <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued on December 12th, and the sale was had on December 19th. The control and custody of the sheriff were almost immediately asserted by the sale, and even if another execution had intervened, Beck &amp; Heiny’s writ would have taken the money. It has nowhere been held that a levy in such circumstances was not sufficient, much less has it been held that such proceedings under a <em>fi. fa. </em>would be entirely void, so that no title would pass by the sale: Wood <em>v. </em>Vanarsdale, <a href="/rawle/3/0401-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="3 Rawle 401" data-case-ids="1822529" data-case-paths="/rawle/3/0401-01">3 Rawle 401</a>, 405.</p>

It was in the midst of winter, and no communication except over the country roads. No other <em>fi. fa. </em>was in the sheriff’s hands, and he advertised the sale to take place in seven days after he received the writ. This itself was an assertion of his control and his levy. And he followed up his <em>fi. fa. </em>immediately with an actual public sale under it with all the due and customary formality. See Wilson, Sieger &amp; Co.’s Appeal, 1 Harris 429; Shafner <em>v. </em>Gilmore, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 438" data-case-ids="1854644" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0438-01">3 W. &amp; S. 438</a>; Schuylkill County’s Appeal, 6 Casey 358.</p>

The hand-bills were all printed. One was put up by the sheriff. The others were delivered to the defendant to be put up in the vicinity of the goods. The sheriff chose to make the defendant his agent for this purpose, and he had a right to do so. The legal presumption is that the bills were put up ; and it was testified by Sheriff Heckman and his deputy that the sale was the largest in its attendance they ever held.</p>

Hower’s goods were not sold in mass, nor at one bid, nor in a few minutes. Nor is there a spark of evidence that either Beck &amp; Heiny or their counsel, or Hower interfered in any manner whatever with the sale, or gave any directions respecting it. The property was not sold by the shelf, but a lot together at so much a yard, put up by the piece with the privilege of taking all the same kind of goods. The hardware was sold by the shelf. The same with the earthenware and crockery in different parcels. The contents of the cellar were not sold together. The sheriff was more than eight hours selling the stock.</p>

They were also impeached because executed in secret. The truth is, they were acknowledged before a magistrate, and attested by him and another witness. It is also urged that Hower and his family lived out of the business, keeping no account of their expenses.

It is argued that Beck &amp; Heiny are estopped from asserting their ownership of the land by this: The mill and distillery with their contents were destroyed by fire in April 1863. After the fire a meeting of the neighbours was held for the purpose of taking measures to raise money to contribute towards the loss. A committee of thirteen was appointed to report a plan. The committee met, and'in the course of their deliberations it was suggested that more money could be raised if the subscription lists were made out in the name of Hower than in the names of Beck &amp; Heiny. The committee adopted this idea, and directed the lists to be prepared accordingly. This was done. Neither Beck nor Heiny nor Hower had anything to do with this arrangement. It was the pious device of sympathizing friends alone-<a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>When these lists were circulated, one of the collection agents, Frederick Horn, testified: <em>“ </em>I commenced with Beck ; told him his neighbourhood had subscribed; told him all the neighbours subscribed, he should too ; that I would have him on the list; I told him it would not look well if he would not subscribe <em>too.” </em>Beck, thus importuned, made a small subscription.' Some of the money collected was paid to Heiny, who signed a receipt for it, not written by himself, in which the treasurer describes himself as “treasurer of the collectors, appointed by a committee for the loss of Adam Hower’s mill and distillery.” And these signatures are claimed to estop Beck &amp; Heiny from setting up their title to the whole of this real estate. There is not a solitary element of estoppel in this whole transaction. In the first place, this assertion of title in Hower (supposing it to arise to that dignity) was never made to the Allentown Bank at any time, either before or after they obtained their judgment. There is no evidence that any officer of the bank ever saw these lists. Second. They never advanced a penny upon the faith of the assertion, nor based any aetion^pon it of any kind. Third. TÍieir position will not be in the least changed by our assertion of our own title; and Fourth. The alleged estoppel is not mutual. The bank would not have been bound if the lists had asserted the title to be in Beck &amp; Heiny.</p>

The court will see that the law was fully and carefully explained to the jury; and every circumstance relied upon by the plaintiffs in error was submitted fairly and impartially.</p>

Counsel admit that this court has directly decided that the defendant in an execution is a competent witness for the plaintiffs, in an issue under the Interpleader Act, and offer no reason why that decision should be reversed. We see no occasion for any argument under this bill. Nor can we conceive of a solitary reason why Mr. Hower is not competent.</p>

It is possible the excellent judge who presides below might make twenty or thirty mistakes in the course of a single trial; or if not, that the eminent counsel might have supposed so; but the probabilities of so many errors are so few, it would seem much more likely that a court of error would listen patiently and examine carefully the few questions presented by the case, than <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>that they should exhaust themselves in a vain endeavour to cover the whole ground of complaint.</p>
    <p id="b411-6" data-blocks='[["BL_411.4",411,[154,519,1167,421]]]'>With these observations we may dispose of the numerous assignments of error by saying, that after a patient examination of all, we discover nothing in any to justify a reversal of the judgment. The case appears to have been well tried, and the real questions submitted to the jury. Adam Ilower was no party to the feigned issue, and his interest, if preponderating either way, was adverse to the plaintiff; for it tended to take from beneath the defendant’s levy, property which went to the payment of his debt, while if the plaintiffs failed they could have no recourse to him.</p>
    <p id="b411-7" data-blocks='[["BL_411.5",411,[155,951,1165,469]]]'>The main ground urged by defendant was that the rule governing sales of personal property should apply to real estate. But the title to real property is governed by the conveyance as its chief index, and not by the possession. Whatever effect the retention of possession may have in a question of actual fraud, it is clear it has no place as the governing rule in questions of legal fraud, except as between purchasers from the same vendor in possession in the case of an unrecorded secret conveyance. The court was therefore clearly right in submitting the question of fraud upon the conveyances of the real estate to the'jury as one of fact, and not a fraud in law.</p>
    <p id="b411-8" data-blocks='[["BL_411.6",411,[153,1424,1164,505]]]'>Whether the sheriff’s sale of the personal estate in 1859 was fraudulent, was also a question of fact. This was not a controversy between rival executions levied on the same property, or a purchase without notice of the levy, raising a question upon the legality of the levy. Admitting no actual seizure of Ilower’s property was made by the sheriff on Beck &amp; Heiny’s writ, it is clear that when the sale took place, it was in the actual power and control of the sheriff, who in point of fact sold and delivered it, at a time when there was no conflict of title or possession. The sale was not in a lump, but by parcels, and in the presence of many persons, the evidence showing that an unusually large concourse attended the sale.</p>
    <p id="b411-9" data-blocks='[["BL_411.7",411,[150,1939,1165,215]]]'>The fact that the advertisements were given to the defendant in the execution to be posted is not, in itself, a ground of legal fraud, while the strong presumption, arising from the large number of bidders, is, that he had faithfully done his duty by posting them in public places.</p>
    <p id="b411-10" data-blocks='[["BL_411.8",411,[150,2155,1162,302]],["BL_412.1",412,[325,443,1167,560]]]'>The fact that the plaintiffs in the execution purchased all the property, and that the prices were low, cannot be looked upon as a badge of legal fraud, though they are circumstances of weight in the question of fraud in fact. The property was publicly sold and delivered by a public officer, upon a legal writ, without adverse levy or claim, and without remonstrance from the defendant in the execution. It went into the actual possession of the <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>plaintiffs in the writ as the purchasers who carried on business upon the real estate conveyed to them in their own names, thus opening accounts and buying and selling from 1859 until 1863, when the levy of the Allentown Bank was made, not upon the identical grain, hay, lumber, &amp;c., but upon the productions of the property coming into existence subsequently. Excepting the buggy and some portions of the stock of merchandise in the store (and what portions were neither identified nor estimated), the personal estate levied in 1859 had been used and disposed of. It was clearly not a case where these badges of fraud existed, following the identical property, and singling it out for pursuit, upon which the law would seize and pronounce it a legal fraud, such as would subject it to the claims of other creditors.</p>
    <p id="b412-6" data-blocks='[["BL_412.4",412,[324,1003,1160,126]]]'>The court therefore properly submitted the real questions, which were of fact, to the jury, whose verdict is to be taken as conclusive of the matters established by it.</p>
    <p id="b412-7" data-blocks='[["BL_412.5",412,[983,1130,455,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
