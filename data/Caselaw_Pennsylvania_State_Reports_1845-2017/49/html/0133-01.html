Now, if the title was in Peter, as I have already said, the plaintiffs cannot recover — they stand on a supposed title in his wife. You have observed that Peter was in possession of the land for many years before his death — a greater length of time, according to the statements of the witnesses, than is required to confer title by possession, where the holding is adverse; that he died there, making a will, whereby he devised the land to his descendants, first to Elias, and after him to others.

If it had come from the mother, he had not a right to do this, for his brothers and sisters, co-heirs of the mother, were equally entitled to the enjoyment of her estate; while if it were regarded as coming from the father, he had such a right conferred upon him by the will. [Then, did he enter and hold under this will ? Bid the parties, even though the land did not belong to the father, suppose it did, and treat it accordingly ?] You have heard the comments of counsel on the one side and on the other in regard to this, in regard to the presumptions and probabilities arising from the evidence, in relation to it.

      <em>“ </em>On the other hand, if the title was in the mother, Mary Worrall, and you do not find it to have been treated by the heirs as having been in the father, Peter Worrall, then the plaintiffs will be entitled to recover; but how much they will be entitled <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>to recover — whether the entire tract or only a part of it — will depend upon how you shall find another question, which I will now state. Mary Worrall, as we have seen, had other children besides Elias; and if this land belonged to her, it descended on her death not to Elias alone, but to him and his brothers and ■ sisters in equal parts. In such event, if the case rested here, 'the plaintiffs, as I have just stated, Avould be entitled to recover, but they could only ’ recover the share of -Elias, as one of the heirs of the mother — which is admitted to be the one-seventh. The plaintiffs contend, however, as we have already seen, that Elias became possessed of the shares of his brothers and sisters, by virtue of the Statute of Limitations. Ordinarily, where one enters upon land and holds it as men hold their own, for twenty-one years, his possession will give him title, by virtue of the statute referred to. Such holding is regarded as adverse -and hostile, and the lapse of twenty-one years, without interference by the rightful owner, will operate to bar his title. The rule is not so, however, where the question arises between tenants in common. The possession of one of several such tenants is the possession of all; he enters and holds not for himself alone, but for himself and his fellows. [To bar the rights of the co-tenants under the statute, there must be something more than holding alone, and receiving the rents and profits, for such holding, without more appearing, cannot be regarded as adverse. There ' must be some denial, by word or deed, of the rights of the co-tenants, such as a refusal to account on demand, a refusal to permit them to enter, offering the property for sale or rent as his own, or some other act plainly evincing that he holds in hostility to their rights. In other words, there must be an ouster of the co-tenants, that is, dispossession or ejection of them from the premises.] Where, however, a co-tenant in common holds the possession for twenty-one years or upwards, undisturbed, claiming the land as his own (which claim may be evinced in the manner just indicated, by denial of the rights of the co-tenants, or offering the property for sale or rent as his own), the law presumes an ouster to have taken place, and this presumption is binding upon the jury. Where nothing further appears than the long possession, and the exclusive receipt of the rents and profits, the law does not presume such ouster. If, however, in such a case, from the great lapse of time, and attending circumstances, or from' the lapse of time alone, the jury considers it reasonable to believe that an ouster has actually taken place, it may and should so find, and in such case the statute will operate to bar the rights of the co-tenants,- after the expiration of the period of twenty-one years from such ouster.</p>

The only evidence on the subject is from defendants’ witnesses, that Elias lived with his father on the place, and continued to live there after his father’s death, until he himself died in 1862. In the absence of evidence upon that point, the law presumes him to have entered in pursuance of his title; and when, as here, a question is made whether he entered as tenant for life or tenant in fee? the law presumes him to have entered under that which is most to his interest. The court erred, therefore, in submitting that question to the jury <a id="p138" href="#p138" data-label="138" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*138</a>without any evidence. Nor was there any evidence in the cause that the heirs “ treated” the title as having been in Peter, or that the parties “supposed” it did, or “considered or treated” it so.

He may have supposed, very innocently, that his long possession had given him a title, as against those in remainder, and we see not how else to interpret his conduct consistently with the theory that he was holding under his father’s will. But whatever his views of his title may have been, the question is, did the acquiescence of the co-heirs of Elias in his possession bar their rights ? This is not a question upon the Statute of Limitations — that subject will be considered hereafter — but it is whether that acquiescence was such recognition and treatment of the title, as coming from Peter Worrall, as to estop them from setting up title under Mary Worrall. And we cannot think it was. The Mary Worrall title could not be divested and transferred to another branch of the family by such treatment.

On the supposition of title originally in Mary'Worrall, and supposing it not treated as belonging to Peter, the court said the plaintiffs could recover. But how much? This was .made to depend upon whether Elias had obtained title by virtue of his possession under the Statute of Limitations. If he had, the plaintiffs could recover the whole, if he had not, they could recover but a seventh.</p>

Where one of several heirs enters or remains in possession of land at the death of the ancestor, the law presumes that he entered, not to abate the shares of his brothers and sisters, but to preserve them for their use, and his entry being consequently theirs, no mere lapse of time will countervail the presumption and give him title in severalty. There must be something more — some plain, decisive, and unequivocal act — to amount to an ouster: Phillips <em>v. </em>

Yet the court, in this instance, put to the jury mere duration of possession as ground for presuming an ouster. In this respect the charge, which for the most part set forth the law on this subject correctly, was, we think, exceptionable. In the evidence, as furnished to us, we see not a single fact, except length of possession, to imply an ouster, and if' the jury believe that Elias entered as heir of his mother, we think an ouster should not he implied from that solitary fact, and that the utmost Elias could devise was his undivided seventh part.</p>
