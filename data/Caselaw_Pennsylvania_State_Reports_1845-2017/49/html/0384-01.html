That all hecould.do was to suspend or adjourn the audit if requested by the lien-creditors, to allow them to apply to the court for an issue to test the validity of the judgment. The auditor took this view o'f the case, but as the lien-creditors did not ask him to suspend the audit, he awarded the fund to Mr. Schick, the appellant, on his judgment.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b387-5" data-blocks='[["BL_387.3",387,[125,409,1158,1334]]]'>
      <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>“ The auditor in this case has, with hesitation, followed some dicta and decisions of the Supreme Court, that a judgment cannot be collaterally attacked for fraud before an auditor. Our practice is different. We do not understand that court ever to have held that in one court a judgment of another court cannot collaterally be impeached for fraud, or that in one case a judgment in the same court in another case cannot be collaterally attacked on the same ground. On the contrary, no point of law can be better settled by themselves than that, and it is of constantly recurring application: Hauer’s Appeal, <a href="/watts-serg/5/0473-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 473" data-case-ids="478782" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/5/0473-01">5 W. &amp; S. 473</a>; Baird <em>v. </em>Campbell, 4 Id. 191; Drexel’s Appeal, 6 Barr 272; Dickinson’s Appeal, 7 Id. 257; Johnson’s Appeal, 9 Id. 416. Now if such a question of fact can be raised and decided in court, why not before an auditor ? A court may establish, as a matter of practice, that their auditors, who are officers of that court subject to their orders, shall not take cognisance of such questions, but that is a mere matter of discretion. The party before an auditor has his right to demand his issue and trial by jury, but if he choose to submit the question to the auditor we see no reason why he should not be allowed to do so, as well as any other question of fact, whether of fraud or anything else. Our practice has always been different, and we have refused, where a controversy upon the <em>lona fides </em>of one of our judgments has arisen in another tribunal, to permit a stranger to come in, and even open or set aside a judgment or have an issue to decide whether it is good as against him. Upon such an issue we could give no judgment — issue no execution. The fraudulent judgment being perfectly good between the parties must stand a valid judgment of this court, no matter how fraudulent it may be as to third parties: Rowland’s Estate, 7 Penna. Law Jour. 312. Exception sustained.”</p>

Yet the decree was that Vanderbelt &amp; Ottinger, as well as Pharo, <em>the </em>surviving partner of Campbell <em>&amp; </em>Pharo, should have the benefit of the verdict. Herein there was manifest error. The decree was right as to Pharo, whose proceedings were regular, but were wrong as to the creditors who took no part in them and asked for no issue.
