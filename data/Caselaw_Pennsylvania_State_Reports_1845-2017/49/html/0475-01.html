On the 6th of August in that year Hower gave plaintiffs .a judgment for $5000, as security for money advanced and to be advanced on consignments of whiskey. This judgment was entered up against real estate. Hower continued his consignments up to 9th September 1859, when he sent William H. Hauser, his clerk, to settle accounts with plaintiffs at Philadelphia.</p>

Subsequently, and before presenting ■the order to Mr. Jones, defendant confessed a large number of judgments, which were entered on record, and on the 12th of December called on Mr. .Jones to enter satisfaction, presenting the order therefor. Mr. Jones declined doing so, for reason that' the defendant had altered the condition of things as they stood at the date of the order, by confessing judgments to an amount far exceeding the value of his real estate, and beyond what he was worth’.</p>

The court had ordered a judgment to' be satisfied and discharged of record, without opening it or directing an issue to determine whether or not it had been paid. We reversed this order and remitted the verdict, with directions to order an issue to try whether the judgment had been paid. This was done, and, after two trials, a verdict was rendered for the defendant. There is nothing in the exceptions to the rejection of evidence, and the only question for us is, whether the court committed any error, in matter of law, in their charge to the jury. If the jury erred in weighing the evidence, that could be only corrected by the court below upon a motion for a new trial, and cannot be urged here.</p>
    <p id="b479-12" data-blocks='[["BL_479.14",479,[203,1623,1164,818]],["BL_480.1",480,[290,411,1160,303]]]'>The evidence of .payment was partly written and partly oral, and was necessarily submitted to the jury, and the plaintiffs’ argument is really that the jury made an error in finding for the defendant. Their argument also supposes that if the defendant had immediately carried the order to Mr. Jones, he would have satisfied the judgment and entered judgment on the $770 judgment-note. The drafts at sixty and ninety days for $1000 each, with the $20 cash, were clearly taken in payment, and accepted as satisfaction, and immediately discharged so much of the original judgment for $5000 which had been reduced at the settlement of the 9th of September 1859 to $2800. If this be so, it would seem natural that the judgment-note for $770, for the balance, at four months, should also be accepted at the same time in payment and satisfaction. At all events, there was'evidence from which the jury might draw such a conclusion. The court therefore laid down the law correctly when they said to the jury, “ If the jury find from the evidence that the single bill for $770 was received by the plaintiffs in <em>payment </em>of the balance due upon their $5000 judgment, their verdict ought to <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>be in favour of tbe defendant. -Rut if, on tbe contrary, they find from the evidence that the single bill was not received by the plaintiffs in payment of the balance due upon their judgment, then their verdict ought to be in favour of the plaintiffs (as the issue is drawn) for the balance due upon that judgment, which would be the $770, together with interest from the date of the single bill, the 9th of September 1859.”</p>
    <p id="b480-6" data-blocks='[["BL_480.4",480,[291,712,1156,130]]]'>This was the pith and marrow of the whole case, and the verdict sustained by the court after this long litigation should finally settle the dispute.</p>
