Pratt &amp; Gould were carrying on a tannery in the neighbourhood, and their object seemed to be to secure the bark for their tannery as they should require it. Hence, the stipulation that it should not be peeled <a id="p512" href="#p512" data-label="512" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*512</a>until they should have realized the product of their previous contract with the same parties for the five hundred and thirty acres; and the further stipulation that the hemlock timber should only be cut in the peeling season. The timber was sold absolutely, but the bark was to be peeled, piled, measured, and paid for at the rate of $1.25 per cord in the woods, and taken by Pratt &amp; Gould — of course they were only to receive it on paying for it. Unlike the former contract, there is no stipulation by which the purchase-money is to be received in bark. Indeed that idea is to some extent negatived by the fact that the whole consideration-money was made payable in yearly instalments within two and a half years, and the purchasers restricted from cutting the hemlock timber for an indefinite period. On the land conveyed, and under the former contract, Newells were only bound to peel one hundred and fifty cords per year, and by the subsequent agreement were not to peel any on the Stewart tract until they had peeled all on the five hundred and thirty acres.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b514-6" data-blocks='[["BL_514.4",514,[278,1189,1165,215]]]'>“ The fair construction of the agreement itself is that the payments were to be made by Newells for the timber, and Pratt &amp; Gould for the bark, in cash.

    <p class="summary" id="b514-7" data-blocks='[["BL_514.5",514,[277,1403,1168,1034]],["BL_515.1",515,[200,408,1168,605]]]'>“It is urged that Newells had no right under their contract to cut the hemlock timber. It must not be forgotten that they had the right by their contract with Pratt &amp; Gould, after giving them notice on the 1st day of April in any year, to peel from two to four hundred cords. Winter wrent upon the tract in 1858, and peeled a quantity of bark. In 1859, he again cut and peeled a large quantity, and did the same in 1860. Pratt &amp; Gould or their successors received and paid for the bark peeled in 1858 and 1859 without objection on their part. Indeed there is not in this entire case evidence of any objection being made by Pratt &amp; Gould at any time to the terms of the contract with Winter. Did they not acquiesce in it by their acts? Can this defendant now avail himself of such defence-against the payment for the timber which he has taken, when he has not been disturbed by the only parties who could complain ? We think not. The Newells made the contract, and from the acts of Pratt &amp; Gould it must be inferred that they acquiesced in it. This brings us to the construction of the contract itself between the Newells and Winter. The business for the years 1858 and 1859 was settled. The defendant took from the tract of land in 1860 and delivered in the Lehigh river, on or before the 10th of May 1861, twelve hundred and forty thousand feet of timber, and he peeled from it and piled in the woods four hundred and, sixty-five cords and forty-eight feet of bark. About the amount <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>of lumber there is no dispute. The quantity and time of delivery is admitted, and the defendant expresses his willingness to pay for it at the contract price. But the defendant claims that under the contract the Newells are bound to take the bark from him in the -woods at $1.25 per cord, and insists upon a credit for that amount. If that question depended alone upon the wnitten contract, it would be for the court to decide, and we would have no hesitation in ruling it against the defendant. The covenants in the agreement are mutual and dependent covenants, and it is to be construed as a whole. The plaintiffs sold the ‘ timber and bark.’ The defendant agreed to pay for it, $1 per thousand feet, and to sell the bark to Pratt &amp; Gould for $1.25 per cord. .The fair construction of the agreement is that Winter agreed to offer the bark to Pratt &amp; Gould at the stipulated price.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b515-6" data-blocks='[["BL_515.4",515,[204,1013,1167,519]]]'>“Newells doubtless made this covenant with him in view of their contract with Pratt &amp; Gould. But this contract did not oblige Winter to sell to Pratt &amp; Gould without either receiving or being secured for his pay. He had a right to demand the cash, as we have shown 'you that the Newells might have done under their contract before delivering the bark. A refusal to pay would have relieved Winter, and he would have been justified in selling the bark elsewhere. The contract was not that the bark should be delivered on account of the Newells, but that Winter might sell it. Suppose he had sold to Pratt &amp; Gould on a long credit, and they had failed to pay, could he have called on Newells to indemnify him for the loss ? This will not be pretended.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b515-7" data-blocks='[["BL_515.5",515,[206,1531,1168,464]]]'>“ Winter -was not bound by the contract to peel the bark. It was left to his option. Suppose he had taken the logs away unpeeled, could Newells have complained? Certainly not. Could Pratt &amp; Gould have followed him, or would they have been turned over to their personal contract with the Newells? Their remedy would have been against the Newells for the loss sustained in not receiving the bark at the stipulated price. Under any fair construction of the written contract the Newells were not bound to receive the bark, and if there were no parol evidence affecting the question, the court would give to the jury binding instructions to that effect.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b515-8" data-blocks='[["BL_515.6",515,[208,2005,1166,303]]]'>“ Have the parties done anything since to warrant a different construction of the agreement, or to change its terms in reference to the bark ? This is a question of fact under the evidence for the jury. Contracts have frequently to be construed by the intentions of the parties manifested by their subsequent acts and declarations, and where that is the case it becomes to a grea.t extent the province of the jury.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b515-9" data-blocks='[["BL_515.7",515,[209,2307,1166,131]],["BL_516.1",516,[292,425,1157,546]]]'>“ There is evidence that the Newells did settle for the bark for two years. This of itself would not change the contract. It may shed some light upon the understanding of the parties in <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>relation to it. If it was a subsequent arrangement by which they agreed to receive in that way so much of their pay, then it should not in any manner affect the original agreement. And if you believe the evidence, that it was done under protest, and with notice that they would not again do so, it would seem to explain to some extent why they did it. The evidence in relation to the act of the Newells in claiming pay for the bark from Pratt &amp; Gould is also for the jury. Taking all of the evidence together, does it satisfy the jury either that Newells originally agreed to take the bark, or that they did so by any subsequent arrangement with Winter ? It is a well-settled principle of law, that to alter or change the terms of a written contract the evidence must be clear and conclusive.</p>

It appears by it, that the Newells contracted to sell to Winter all the hemlock, spruce, and pine timber, of a merchantable character, standing on what is denominated the Charles Stewart tract of land in Tobyhanna township, Monroe county, in consideration whereof Winter agreed to take off the land about a million of feet a year and pay for the same, as soon as it should be in the Lehigh river and ready to be run, or within thirty days thereafter, one dollar per thousand; to have the bark free of charge. The said Winter agreeing to sell (the bark) to the firm known as Pratt &amp; Gould, piled in the woods, for one dollar and twenty-five cents per cord; and Newells agreeing “ to protect in every respect the said Winter, so far as the same may be necessary to take off the timber hereby sold.”</p>
    <p id="b517-10" data-blocks='[["BL_517.12",517,[226,2122,1164,344]],["BL_518.1",518,[255,451,1155,425]]]'>Now, here is a clear agreement on part of the plaintiffs below to sell all the timber mentioned to the defendant; and a stipulation to protect him in taking it from the land, without reservation or restriction. As to the bark to be had from the timber, he was under no express contract to peel and pile it. In the absence of any restrictive stipulation, he had an option to do it or not. This manifestly resulted from his purchase of the timber, and his right, so far as the vendors were concerned, to take it off; but <a id="p516" href="#p516" data-label="516" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*516</a>if he did peel the bark, he agreed to sell it to Pratt &amp; Gould at $1.25 per cord. But the latter were no parties to the contract, and were not bound to take it, nor had they any interest in the timber itself, as will appear presently. This was therefore manifestly an agreement only to sell to Pratt &amp; Gould, if they'should wish to buy, or were able to pay. There is not a syllable to show that the Newells agreed to pay for it if the company did not take it. So far from it, they did not even bind Winter to peel the bark, and fully agreed to protect him in taking off the timber, if he did not choose to do so.</p>
    <p id="b518-6" data-blocks='[["BL_518.4",518,[255,879,1158,1540]]]'>But it was contended by the plaintiff in error that in the sale of the timber on this tract, by Pratt &amp; Gould to the Newells, there is a reservation in regard to the bark which, lying in the line of the title acquired by Winter, materially varies this aspect of the case. Of course that contract preceded his, but whether he is to be presumed as having notice of it, or bound by anything in it, I will not stop to inquire; for the supposed effect of that agreement, granting that otherwise it might have affected the contract between the plaintiffs below and the defendant, is not properly estimated. The only construction possible to be put on it is, that it was a sale of all the hemlock, spruce, pine, and chestnut timber on the tract, to be paid for as therein stipulated ; that is to say, the Newells were to pay for the timber in three instalments the aggregate sum of $1220 and interest, and were to receive for bark to be peeled on it at the rate of $1.25 per cord, peeled and piled to the extent of from two to four hundred cords a year. Nowhere was there a sale of the timber by the one party, and an agreement to sell the bark by the other. They are entirely independent covenants as they stand in the agreement. It is alleged that Pratt &amp; Gould reserved the hemlock timber in this agreement, and that Winter took his contract subject to this reservation, and therefore that he was bound by that reservation to let Pratt &amp; Gould have the bark in obedience to the reservation in the contract with the Newells. But we have seen that they were under no written agreement to sell them the bark, but only if they did, it should be at the stipulated price of $1.25 per acre. It is obvious, therefore, that if there was a reservation of the timber, or any part of it, by Pratt &amp; Gould in their contract with the Newells, and the reservation passed into their contract with Winter, that would be no reason why Newells should pay for peeling and piling bark for Pratt &amp; Gould’s benefit. It was a reservation not to the former but to the latter. There is not a word of reservation by Newells. If it exists at all it must be because it did not pass by their contract, never being in them to sell, because reserved by way of exception as against them.</p>
    <p id="b518-7" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[301,2420,1113,33]],["BL_519.1",519,[232,415,1165,775]]]'>But there was no reservation. The words of the contract <a id="p517" href="#p517" data-label="517" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*517</a>between Pratt &amp; Gould and the Newells are: “ The hemlock is to be left, standing until the fulfilment of the contract between the parties of September 18th 1857,” &amp;c. It had been sold in express terms before. It was not therefore reserved by way of exception out of the thing granted, and it was not a case of reservation at all. See Whitaker <em>v. </em>Brown, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wright%20197" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Wright 197">10 Wright 197</a>. It was but a personal covenant by the buyers that they would let the hemlock timber stand as agreed. But as they had bought it out and out, they might sell it as they did without any covenant on the subject. Now in all this, where is there anything in the papers in evidence to bind Newells to pa.y for the bark ? That there was nothing, was the conclusion of the court in regard to the written contract. The learned judge received all the evidence he deemed to be legal, for the purpose of showing by parol a different arrangement, and that the Newells were bound to pay for the timber, and submitted it to the jury with unexceptionable instructions, and the jury found against the claim. Thus in neither aspect was there any such obligation as claimed.</p>
    <p id="b519-6" data-blocks='[["BL_519.4",519,[229,1191,1165,764]]]'>A few words as to the bills of exception upon the offers of testimony. We think that none of the offers in relation to the report of the master, in the case of Lee <em>v. </em>Gould, were admissible. The report of the master was offered as evidence <em>per se </em>that the Newells claimed for the bark before him. It was not such a proceeding as was binding on everybody, and it was in a case in which the Newells were not parties; it was a fact <em>in pais, </em>and provable only as such. That it might have been admissible as corroborative of what the witnesses testified to, in regard to the acts of the Newells, or one of them, on that occasion, is possible, but it was not offered for that purpose. The court did receive the record and report for another purpose, and it was before the jury. Although it was received for a definite purpose, if it had contained evidence of importance by way of corroboration of what was sworn, if there was anything to corroborate, it is most likely it would have been considered. But be this as it may, there was no error in its rejection for <em>the </em>purposes for which it was offered.</p>

It was not shown that they requested the entry to be made, and the books were not theirs nor within their control. Shop-books are only evidence by custom, of goods sold and delivered, and work, labour, and services performed. They are not evidence to prove any other fact. They may <em>be </em>evidence as admissions against those who write in them, just as any other writing made by a party may be evidence by way of admission, but not because they are shop-books. They were not evidence by reason of anything appearing in the case, such as the agency <a id="p518" href="#p518" data-label="518" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*518</a>of the Newells in procuring the entry to be made, and then the fact could have been established by testimony <em>aliunde, </em>and the books would possibly have been corroborative evidence, but no more. There was no error committed in their rejection and the accompanying offers.</p>
