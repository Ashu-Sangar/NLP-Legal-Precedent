On February 25th 1857, the treasurer of the United States paid $326,501.70 on account. The warrants were endorsed in blank by plaintiff, and delivered to defendant, as her agent, to pay claims, and return the balance.

The defendant came to Philadelphia, and as early as March 7th 1857, received part of the $100,000. By the 19th March the balance of the $100,000 was drawn out of bank, except $200 in the Bank of North America, and $37,111.37 in the Bank of Pennsylvania, which was held by the bank, by reason of a bill filed by a creditor of- the estate, until it failed, when the creditor received a check for $15,000, and a check for the balance was received by the defendant, and sold at a loss of $5615.36.

Oloss, and endorsed by him and defendant, March 12th, $3500; one check to “self or bearer” March 16th, $20,500, and a small check of $50. The deposit in Bank of Northern Liberties was drawn in one check to “self or bearer,” March 16th, $25,000. The deposit in Bank of Pennsylvania was drawn on as follows : —March 4th, self or bearer, $500; March 5th, A. J. Reeside, $2000; March 5th, S. C. Perkins, $510.87; March 5th, J. E.

All the above checks tvere in the handwriting of defendant. The testimony of A. J. Reeside w'as as follows:— “Not long after the money was deposited, John came to my mother and told her there were some judgments to be paid, and there was money wanted to pay them. I asked John why he should want to draw on this money ? I said that it was singular the $226,000 was not enough. He told me it was all important, —he must have the money. He got the money.

The report was confirmed, and on appeal this court made a final decree in January Term 1863. This money being necessary to be produced, the defendant, after repeated requests, met his mother at Mr. Perkins’s office.

All these statements were made within sixty days from March 8th 1860.” He adds: “I asked John what would be the result of the estate, and how the estate was going, and what would be the amount distributed to Mrs. Reeside and the other children.

    <p class="summary" id="b327-8" data-blocks='[["BL_327.6",327,[185,1149,1169,1120]]]'>“ If it were possible to consider this an action of <em>assumpsit </em>for the recovery of the money which passed into the defendant’s hands, I do not see how, under the evidence, it could be sustained. The testimony all goes to show that the very large sums of money which passed into his hands, did so as the agent of the executrix, the plaintiff, for the payment of debts or claims on the estate. It is equally apparent that very large sums were disbursed under the agency. This establishes a case of principal and agent, and no account stated or settled. The form of action in such circumstances is material; it is account render. Although assailed very severely of late, it still serves as a remedy in a case like the present. A direct action to recover all the money in such a case doe's not lie. There is no implied promise to return money delivered to an agent to be expended on the agency, unless indeed where the agent refuses to administer it at all. What I mean is, that if an agent expends money in the course of an agency in which there are money items and transactions, the principal cannot sue to recover back money paid on an item in the course of an agency on an alleged misappropriation. If so, every item might be so tested. The law has provided a remedy in account render, in wdiich the entire accounts may he tested, misappropriations disallowed and charged over to the agent, credits given, and a balance struck. It is so far equitable in form as to admit of the parties being sworn and compelled to disclose all about the matters of the agency. The action, however, here is neither in <em>assumpsit </em>nor account render.</p>

This is not proved. The items are <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>pointed out to us as evidence of fraudulent appropriation. Fraud is composed in several elements, misappropriation and concealment, with a dishonest intent — deceit for the purpose of gain. If John E. Reeside had settled his accounts with his mother, and had fraudulently concealed anything misappropriated or misapplied by him, his principal, on discovering it, might sue for and recover it directly; so might this be done if the whole had been fraudulently disposed of. Here it appears that one or two items are supposed to show fraud. Stewart, being employed as agent to prosecute the Reeside claim before Congress, agrees to give, out of his own percentage if successful, $&gt;10,000 to the defendant. He afterwards receives this. It is said that it was a fraud upon his estate, or rather upon his mother, to pay Stewart his full compensation, deducting this sum for himself. I see nothing like fraud in it. Whether his mother knew of it or not does not appear. No deceit seems to have been practised. Granted, if you please, that he might not be entitled to retain it, this does not establish fraud in its retention. Indeed it was not designated as the subject of this suit — nor has the plaintiff shown anything about it — that she did not agree to it; that she was deceived in paying it. If money to pay it was not properly applied, it was an item to settle as any other item in the proper action. The same may be said about the percentage Stewart agreed to pay out of the share or percentage allowed him for collection by creditors. If he had agreed to give the same sum to any one else, and it had been paid, it would have been all right. But it is alleged that as the creditors were reported by defendant as paid in full, while a part of it was allowed to him by Stewart, this established a fraud. It is not alleged that the creditors were paid more than was due them; but that the agent of the plaintiff made something out of them through' their counsel, who employed him to assist to settle with them. The estate lost nothing in the settlement. The agent gained something. Be it the rule that on settlement he might have to account for this sum to his principal, there is no evidence of collusion, or concealment, or fraud in it, shown. I could not allow the jury to find against the defendant without evidence of fraud, when the action, as appears by the <em>narr. </em>and original affidavit, is founded on it.</p>

It is the duty of the court to nonsuit the plaintiff if it would grant a new trial in case there was a finding for him. It is an unpleasant duty, I know, for counsel greatly <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>prefer their chances with the jury, but there is more certainty under the rule than without it.

There is no doubt, where a duty arises out of an -implied undertaking to do an act requiring skill or fidelity, that a breach of the duty may be the subject of an action of <em>assumpsit </em>upon the implied promise, or of an action upon the special case for the tort: Arnold <em>v. </em>Zell, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Penn.%20292" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="2 Penn. 292">2 Penn. 292</a>; Hunt <em>v. </em>Wynn, <a href="/watts/6/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="6 Watts 47" data-case-ids="1846101" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0047-01">6 Watts 47</a>; McCahan <em>v. </em>Hirst, 7 <a href="/watts/6/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="6 Watts 47" data-case-ids="1846101" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0047-01">Id. 175</a>; Todd <em>v. </em>Figley, Id. 542; McCall <em>v. </em>Forsyth, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 179" data-case-ids="1856539" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0179-01">4 W. &amp; S. 179</a>; Smith <em>v. </em>Seward, 3 Barr 342; Burnett <em>v. </em>Lynch, 5 B. &amp; C. 609. The breach of duty and not fraud, is the foundation of the action. 'If, therefore, this were a case where the agent, having received the money of his principal to perform a certain trust, had wholly omitted to perform his duty, and converted the money to his private use, the entire breach of duty no doubt would expose him to an action in form <em>ex delicto, </em>or to an action of <em>assumpsit </em>for money had and received to the use of the plaintiff.</p>
    <p id="b333-9" data-blocks='[["BL_333.11",333,[174,1618,1174,775]],["BL_334.1",334,[298,408,1173,1120]]]'>But the misfortune of the plaintiff’s case was that her proof transcended the terms of her declaration. She succeeded in proving, not only that the defendant had received the money she had committed to his charge, and that he was her agent and had undertaken to pay the money over to the creditors of the estate she represented, but also that he was in fact her substitute in the general administration of that estate, receiving all the moneys and making all the payments in the settlement of a very large and complicated business, involving settlements, compromises, and various transactions with the creditors of the estate and the claimants of the fund specially procured from the government. She proved that, being incapable of business herself, she committed everything to his hands. It is clear that the proof, instead of showing a violation of the duty involved in the undertaking of the defendant to administer the estate as her agent and substitute, proved the contrary, and that he had performed that duty to a very large extent, entitling him to an allowance for fees and expenses incurred in the service and all <a id="p332" href="#p332" data-label="332" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*332</a>payments made in pursuance of his trust. As a necessary and legal consequence, he had a right to settle an account of his transactions to show performance of this duty, so far as he had fairly and legally executed it. In this respect it is manifest that his case runs in exact parallel with hers. Is there any good reason why her administration of the fund should he the subject of a settlement and account, and not of an ordinary action of <em>assumpsit? </em>Precisely so it should be with him, for all that she could settle as executrix, he did as substitute and agent. Now, throwing out of view the peculiar features of the laws which make her amenable to the Orphans’ Court and compel her to settle an account of her administration, if a common-law action could be applied to her, it would not be <em>assumpsit, </em>which is founded on the express or implied promise to pay over the fund to those representing the succession; but an action based upon the duty to account and exhibit the payments to creditors stand ing in a higher right, and the expenses of administration before the balance can be struck. This would be the action of account render. Between her and her agent or substitute, who undertook, not to pay the fund directly to her, but to others duly entitled, upon the exhibition and settlement of their claims, the duty is precisely the same, to wit, to render an account. She is not entitled to the fund as her own, but to an account of it; which involves the consideration and adjudication of the rightfulness of the claims of those standing in a superior degree, and the regularity of their payment.</p>
    <p id="b334-6" data-blocks='[["BL_334.4",334,[296,1527,1170,863]],["BL_335.1",335,[144,435,1169,122]]]'>This, I take it, is the true ground of distinction in such cases, by which we determine whether the action should be <em>assumpsit </em>or account render, to wit, the duty to pay, or to account; a distinction inhering in the very nature of the undertaking itself. When the promise, expressed or implied, involves the duty of direct payment to the plaintiff, <em>assumpsit </em>is the proper form of action ; as where a co-obligee or co-tenant receives the whole sum to which both are entitled: Gillis <em>v. </em>McKinney, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0078-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 78" data-case-ids="480170" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0078-01">6 W. &amp; S. 78</a>. But where the duty is not direct, but one of outlay in the performance of a trust or business which from its nature requires an exhibit of the sums expended, before the direct duty can arise, the legal requirement is to render an account, and <em>assumpsit </em>will not lie till the balance be ascertained. Such is the case of a partner transacting the business of a firm, or of a bailiff managing an estate: McFadden <em>v. </em>Sallada, 6 Barr 287; Briden <em>v. </em>Dwerr, <a href="/watts/2/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="2 Watts 95" data-case-ids="1840169" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0095-01">2 Watts 95</a>. The question is not, as it is sometimes supposed, whether a jury can as conveniently settle the account as auditors, but it adheres to the right of the defendant to render his account before he can be molested by an action to refund. The law will not imply a promise to repay before his liability to <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>refund has been ascertained. The right to render an account and settle exists in the very nature and equity of such a duty as this defendant assumed.</p>
    <p id="b335-6" data-blocks='[["BL_335.4",335,[144,564,1169,347]]]'>These reasons show the fallacy of selecting the $10,000 and $13,000 items as a ground of recovery <em>ex delicto. </em>They are a part of the fund received, and necessarily stand in the account. Whether the defendant will be entitled to a credit therefor, must depend on his right to retain them. Here the reasons of fault or fraud, why he, should not, will have their weight; and, if he cannot retain, they will, as a part of the fund, continue to stand in the account against him.</p>
    <p id="b335-7" data-blocks='[["BL_335.5",335,[143,910,1170,348]]]'>It is said the action of account render is inconvenient and cumbrous. This is true, but it is remedied by the Act of 13th August 1840, giving a bill in equity in all cases where the action of account render has been the accustomed remedy. It was in the power of the plaintiff to go into chancery, but she preferred an. arrest of the person of the defendant, and therefore resorted to an action in form <em>ex delicto. </em>Being mistaken in this, the judgment must be Affirmed.</p>
