To prove these facts, the auditor received testimony, as he says, without objection, and found the facts to be so. He accordingly reported distribution in favour of the subsequent levies ; but, on exceptions to his report for so doing, the District Court overruled him, and to the subsequent decree of distribution which awarded the money to the prior executions, these appeals are taken.</p>

This must be conceded. The law is undoubtedly that they are conclusive <em>only </em>in the cases in which they were made, and upon privies : Watson on Sheriffs 72; Sewell Id. 387; Lowry <em>v. </em>Coulter, 9 Barr 349. Many other authorities might be cited to the same effect, but are not needed. But the appellant’s difficulty lies not in this, but in the necessity, in order to arrive at what he claims, to contradict the returns on his own writs. He insists on striking out in effect, by testimony <em>aliunde, </em>what is not extrinsic matter in his returns, namely, that the levies are subject to prior levies. If it were foreign or extrinsic matter, it would legally be no part of a proper return, and would prove nothing; but it is not so : it is the regular mode of stating the facts of the levy. Upon the principle of the authorities, conceded by the appellant’s counsel, and which could not have been denied, viz., that the return on an execution is conclusive in the case, I see not what possible escape there is for the appellant from its force. His returns are levied subject to prior levies. May he contradict them ? If he may, the principle does not exist; but we know it does, and, as it does, he cannot evade it by any theory made apparent in these cases. I will admit that the rule seems to operate somewhat inequitably in this case; but there is no principle to dispense with it.</p>

There the last <em>four </em>writs were levied <em>on firm </em>property subject to a prior levy on the property, as belonging to one of the partners. The auditor held these returns conclusive on the subsequent writs, and the court below affirmed the report; but this court reversed and sent back the case for a decree according to, the rights of the creditors, on firm and separate property. That <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>case is not like this.
