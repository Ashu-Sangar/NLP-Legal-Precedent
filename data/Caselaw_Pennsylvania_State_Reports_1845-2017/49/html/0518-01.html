Burke, to recover a sum of money paid by him in satisfaction of a mortgage which was a lien on certain real estate conveyed by Gummey to Burke, and which Burke, as vendee, had assumed to pay.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b520-14" data-blocks='[["BL_520.11",520,[293,1532,1160,257]]]'>The case was this: — Thomas A. Gummey, by indenture in the usual form, in consideration of $1000, conveyed to William A. Burke a house and lot, “ subject to the payment of a mortgage-debt, or sum of $1000, secured by indenture of mortgage given by the said Thomas A. Gummey to Thomas Cain, dated the 17th day of January 1857, recorded,” &amp;c.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b520-15" data-blocks='[["BL_520.12",520,[291,1788,1160,419]]]'>Burke paid the cash consideration, accepted the deed, and entered into possession. Subsequently he sold the property subject to the same mortgage. The interest upon the mortgage became in arrear, and the holder sued it out, and sold the mortgaged premises at sheriff’s sale. The proceeds of the sale yielded only about $100 towards the payment of the mortgage. The holder of the mortgage then entered judgment upon Gummey’s bond, and, under threat of execution, he paid the balance due on the bond. To recover the amount thus paid Gummey brought this suit.</p>

We have no cases that are not reconcileable with the doctrine'that one who purchases expressly subject to an encumbrance as between the vendor and himself makes the debt his own, and assumes to protect the vendor. Such assumption is in part or in whole the consideration of the conveyance to him. It would be strange were it not so. In this case Gummey sold to Burke for $1000 a lot subject to a mortgage for $1000, given by the vendor. Burke obtained the lot for $1000 less, because he took it expressly subject to the mortgage. If, now, he can cast the payment of the mortgage upon his vendor, he does not take the lot encumbered, for he compels the vendor to take off the encumbrance, and indirectly recovers the consideration which he has paid. It is manifest such was not the understanding of the parties. It is a rational deduction, from their language, and from the transaction, that the vendee undertook to protect the vendor against the debt that was secured by mortgage on the premises.</p>
