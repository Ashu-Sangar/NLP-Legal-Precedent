In Pennsylvania there is no constitutional restriction. To provide for the wants of the government under our constitution the power of the legislature is arbitrary and unrestricted. They have the same power to tax the property of the citizen twice or thrice that they have to tax it once. Against the taxing power or the statutes providing for the manner in which the taxes should be levied and collected, it is no argument to say that the taxes are onerous, unequal, inequitable, or unjust. And to all such argument when attempted to be used, it is a sufficient answer to say, ‘thus saitli the law.’ The 32d section of the Act of 29th of April 1844, Purd. Dig. 949, specifies in detail the subjects of taxation, whether owner by a natural or artificial person, — and among-these subjects of taxation are enumerated ‘all shares of stock in any bank, institution, or company, now or hereafter incorporated by or in pursuance of any law of this Commonwealth, or of any other state or government.’ Stocks being personal property follow the person of the owner.

Has this clause of the 33d section of the Act of 29th of April 1844 been repealed? The 83d section of the same act provides for the collection of taxes chargeable on stock held by or under institutions incorporated by the laws of Pennsylvania, and its provisions are inapplicable to the case in hand. The 34th section of the same act changes the rate of assessments of property enumerated in the 33d section. The Act of 12th of April 1859 provides for the assessment and collection of taxes on stocks of companies created by the laws, of this state, and leaves the question untouched presented in the ‘ case stated.’ The provision in the clause referred to in the 33d section of the Act of 29th April 1844 is unrepealed and remains in force. The 3d section of the Act of 22d April 1846, Purd. Dig. 951, prescribes the duty of assessors as follows : — It shall hereafter be the duty of each assessor within this Commonwealth, at the time of making the assessments in his ward, borough, or township, to require ev-ery person, every firm and partnership, and the president, secretary, cashier, or treasurer of every company or corporate body subject to taxation therein, to deliver to him a statement in writing, or partly written and partly printed, showing the aggregate amount of money due, &amp;c., ‘and also the amount of all shares or stock held or owned by such person, company, firm, or corporate body in any bank, institution, or company now or hereafter incorporated in pursuance of any law of any other state or government; and all public loans or stocks whatever except those issued by this Commonwealth, and all money loaned on interest in any other state.’</p>

This is a natural consequence of the first proposition, for it would be wholly incompatible with the equality and exclusiveness of the sovereignty of all nations, that any one nation should be at liberty to regulate either persons or things not within its own territory. It would be equivalent to a declaration, that the sovereignty over a territory was never exclusive in any nation, but only concurrent with that of all nations; that each could legislate for all, and none for itself; and that all might establish rules, which none were bound to obey. The absurd results of such a state of things need not be dwelt upon. Accordingly Rodenburg has significantly said, that no sovereign has a right to give the law beyond his own dominions ; and if he attempts it, he may be lawfully refused obedience, for whenever the foundation of laws fails there, their force and jurisdiction fail also.” § 20.

It goes to his executor or administrator, and not to the heirs, and is carried into the inventory of his personal effects. When it is argued, therefore, that the foundry, machine-shop, and other estate of the corporation, being within the state of New Jersey, are subject wholly to the same exclusive state jurisdiction there which we claim for this state over property within its territory, another ownership is stated and a new issue introduced. But to that property the defendant below has no title ; his title being in the shares he holds, and not in the property of' the corporation. No execution against him there wrould sell a spark of right to it, nor would his heirs at law succeed to any estate in it.
