Jeffreys owned a right of way over the land of White. He had on hand the materials which would be required in building a new dam. He granted to White the privilege of using these materials to build a dam, surrendered his right of way, and in consideration thereof was to have the use of a certain portion of the water. To a certain extent he is the preferred party in its use; but this amounts to little, as the evidence shows there was never any lack of water, except in very dry seasons. From the evidence, White was the party to be chiefly benefited by the new dam. Jeffreys, for twelve years, had been running his mill with water from a dam built for the very purpose. White was a new comer, and was about to engage in manufacturing. He needed a dam, and could well afford to build it if the materials were furnished him, and the right of wray across his land surrendered.</p>

It has never been granted by the Commonwealth to any of her citizens, and private surveys, bounding on the river, stop at low-water mark. In regard to such rivers, the Mill-Dam Act of 23d March 1803 is but a license to the riparian owner. He can have no estate in the river or its bed. Can two parties, owning land on opposite sides of such a river, bargain themselves into such a tenancy of it as implies some estate residing in them ? Is not such a bargain against public policy, and void? We refer in this connection to Monongahela Navigation Co. <em>v. </em>Coons, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20112" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 112">6 W. &amp; S. 112</a>; Shrunk <em>v. </em>Schuylkill Navigation Co., 14 S. &amp; R. 79; Susquehanna Canal Co. <em>v. </em>Wright, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2011" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 11">9 W. &amp; S. 11</a>; Barclay Railroad &amp; Coal Co. <em>v. </em>Ingham, 12 Casey 194.</p>

But he also changed the jury that Campbell must be held to have revived and ratified that agreement, because first, of his statements that he claimed the use of the water; and, secondly, because independent of this, the mere enjoyment of benefits raised a liability to share the burdens of maintaining the dam. It does not seem that the evidence justifies the allegation of any contract arising out of the statements of Campbell. None of the witnesses testify to any allegation by Charles B. Campbell, in the presence of the plaintiffs, or which was communicated to them, -of a contract between the parties. Suppose there never had been any such agreement as that of 5th February 1844, between Jeffreys and White, could occasional remarks of Campbell, to his own employees, be construed into a contract with White, Hand &amp; Co. that he would, for all time, hold himself liable to contribute one-half the expense .of maintaining the dam ? And if the agreement was destroyed by the sheriff’s sale, the position, in law, of these parties, is just what it would be had no such agreement been made. An encumbrance, which has been discharged by a judicial sale, cannot be galvanized into life by declarations of the party against whom it stood. A new agreement may be made, but a dead obligation cannot be ratified so as to live again.</p>

We submit that in this there was error. Where there is a special privity of contract, as in the case of sureties, or joint and several debtors, or endorsers and acceptors of a negotiable security, a payment by one raises an implied promise of contribution by the others.

Finding the dam built, he used it. When it went out, he made his arrangements to use the old dam again. Hand, White &amp; Co. judged it expedient for their own interests to rebuild the dam, and call upon Campbell to join them in doing so, which he promptly declined. In all this there was neither a request nor a promise on his part, and it can readily be seen that the plaintiffs found sufficient motive, in their own profit, for wishing the dam rebuilt, without special reference to the interests of Campbell. If Campbell can be compelled to assist in rebuilding this dam whenever it needs repair, then every person who uses water from a neighbour’s well, and every traveller who drives over a private road or bridge, may be forced to contribute <a id="p238" href="#p238" data-label="238" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*238</a>to the repairs which accident or time may render necessary to. either the well, the road, or the bridge.</p>

The learned judge of the special court, held the defendant bound to contribute for repairs if he claimed the benefits of the covenants, and they were conceded to him by the co-tenant. These were facts proved and left 'to the jury, and they have found them to be true. The inquiry naturally arises in the mind, is there any good reason why this should not be so ? I will not undertake to say that the contract created covenants running with the land, because the covenantor could not impose an encumbrance or duty that might not be divested by a sale of the premises so encumbered by a prior judgment, a sale on which would carry back the title to a period coeval with the date of the lien; and the case is not to be rested on this ground. If the covenants had been anterior to the lien of the judgment, then they would in form and in fact have been clearly covenants running with the land. Thus the matter stood under the sheriff’s sale. Now why should not the assent of the sheriff’s vendee and that of the remaining co-tenant be sufficient to continue the original covenants in their original efficiency ? I do not think it is a sufficient negative of the inquiry to say that the remedy on the covenants is not pursued. The same objection might be urged in familiar instances resembling this. The property of a landlord is seized and sold, and there is a tenant whose lease is subsequent to the judgment; it is the law that the acceptance of rent by the sheriff’s vendee is a binding recognition of the lease, and the tenant would have the right of legal remedies against his new landlord. So the acceptance of services raises an implied promise to pay for them. Where a duty to contribute exists, the action is' generally on the duty or rather on the <em>assumpsit </em>arising out of the duty, and not always on the instrument or debt discharged. So here we have demands on part of the defendant for the benefit conferred on his property under the covenants between the original joint owners or tenants in common of the mill-dam. They are acceded to, and his enjoyment is henceforth by election and adoption under the contract, and he cannot escape the concomitant burden of maintaining, by contributing his due proportion of .the expense of keeping up the dam, the benefits of which he claimed to exist by force of the contract. We doubt not he might have repudiated it, but did not, <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>and he must stand to his election. He has received consideration for it in the concession to him by the other party on whom the demand was made, and this was sufficient under the circumstances to raise an implied promise to pay his proportion of the repairs. He must not blow hot and cold in the same breath.</p>
    <p id="b243-6" data-blocks='[["BL_243.4",243,[178,630,1162,935]]]'>The Mill-Dam Act of 23d of March 1803 licenses the owners of lands on navigable streams to erect dams on the same, under the conditions mentioned, subordinate to the rights of the public, and generally the passage of fish. Against all but the public, it is a permanent or real right. It may not be disturbed excepting by proceedings in the name of the public. It was decided in Criswell <em>v. </em>Clugh, <a href="/watts/3/0330-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Watts 330" data-case-ids="1841316" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0330-01">3 Watts 330</a>, that even where a dam erected under the act became a public nuisance, yet the private right of abatement did not exist. There is therefore, in a subordinate sense, property in the bed of the stream, which may be held and transmitted like any other real interest by a riparian owner as an incident of his estate; and where a dam is erected for the use of a mill, no one can doubt that it would pass as appurtenant to the mill. This being the nature of the right, why may not there be a tenancy in common of a dam erected by the owners of the land on the opposite sides of a navigable stream ? It cannot be doubted, I think, but that there may, and there doubtless are many instances of the kind. This is not very material to the case in hand, excepting to show that the character of the property to which the contribution was due differed essentially in nothing from the ordinary case of contribution for repairs by tenants in common of other real estate.</p>
