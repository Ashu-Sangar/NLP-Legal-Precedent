The plaintiff having issued a <em>fi. fa., </em>and the return being <em>nulla bona, </em>he ‘has done all the law requires of him in favour of the guarantor.’ No offer, we repeat, having been made to show that the tenant owned real estate here or elsewhere, or personal property out of the county of Philadelphia.</p>

And we are of opinion that he undertook as surety. His engagement was direct, and not contingent. The c.ase is not to be distinguished from Marburger <em>v. </em>Potts, 4 Harris 9. In both cases the form of the contract was that of an original and absolute liability. Marburger <em>v. </em>Potts was not shaken by the subsequent case of Gilbert <em>v. </em>Hench, 6 Casey 205, where the engagement of the defendant was in different terms. It was not noticed, indeed, in the opinion of the court. Nor was it necessary, to the decision of the latter ease, to determine whether the instrument sued upon was an engagement of suretyship or of guaranty. Considered as either, the plaintiff was entitled to his judgment.</p>
