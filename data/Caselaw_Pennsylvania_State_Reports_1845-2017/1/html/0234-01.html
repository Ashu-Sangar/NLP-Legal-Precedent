The declaration also averred, that the Grand Inquest of the said county, at August session, 1843, found a true bill, commonly called a bill of indictment for a riot, against the plaintiff, Titus Smith, Jun., John Green, and William Green; and that on the trial of the same, the said plaintiff was acquitted, and the prosecutor directed to pay the costs.</p>

That on the following day Green, the defendant in the ejectment, preferred a charge against Travis, before Justice Lewis, for a breach of the Sabbath, obtained a warrant, and placed it in the hands of Titus Smith, Jun., then constable of the township. Smith accompanied Green and his brother to the place, and found Travis working at the building. Green requested Travis to leave the building, and stated that he would tear it down. Travis, after some words, left the building and came in the road to Smith, who arrested him under the warrant, while Green and his brother pulled down the building.' After the Greens had torn down the building, which occupied them from five to ten minutes, all the parties went before the justice. Travis, upon being brought before the justice, pleaded guilty to the charge of Sabbath-breaking, and afterwards instituted the prosecution against the two Greens and Smith, as alleged in the declaration. It also appeared, that Smith arrested several others under the same warrant during the time the Greens were tearing down the building, and brought them before justice Sines, with Travis and the Greens. g</p>

As the authority to institute a criminal prosecution, and the extent of that authority, are derived from the law, the law must judge of its exercise; it is therefore the duty of the court to determine whether the proof of certain facts constitutes probable cause, and it is error to submit that question to the jury. The duty of the jury is to say what facts are proved, and for that purpose they are to decide on the weight of evidence, the credibility of witnesses, the truth of conflicting allegations. The general question of probable cause is then a mixed question of law,and fact, composing two distinct inquiries, both conducted at the same time on a jury trial, but yet cognizable before two distinct tribunals, 'each of which discharges its proper functions. In the present instance, the court below threw it on the jury to say, as a question of fact on the evidence, whether there was probable cause. This was leaving to them, in part, a question of law which"the court was bound to decide; and it has frequently been held to be error to leave the law to the jury This case must therefore be tried again, that the court may instruct the jury accordingly, as the case may hereafter appear.</p>
