At the following term, he reported to the court, that he had sold the same to Samuel Wilson for the sum of $500. The sale was confirmed, and a deed executed and delivered by the administrator to the purchaser. The defendant was in possession, as the tenant of the purchaser, Samuel Wilson. At the trial, the plaintiffs con<a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>tended that the sale to Wilson was fraudulent, in consequence of an agreement at the sale between him and'the administrator, that the land was to be purchased and held in partnership. To prove this agreement, Christian Brenneman, the administrator, was called as a witness. The counsel of the defendant objected, that the witness was not competent to contradict his return to the order of sale, and his deed to Samuel Wilson, the purchaser, containing a full recital of all the proceedings in the Orphans’ Court. It was also further objected, that if the admi. nistrator, who was offered as a witness, could not be compelled to account either to the estate, or to the purchaser for the price of the land, in the event of a recovery by the plaintiffs in this suit, he had a pecuniary interest in the event of the suit.</p>

The administrator was offered as a witness to prove the fact, and was objected to because his testimony contradicted his return, and the deed he had made to the purchaser. But the court properly held, that proving fraudulent conduct at the time of the sale is not contradicting the record; and they might have added, on the authority of Baring <em>v. </em>Shippen, 2 Binney, 165, and other cases, that a grantor is permitted to impeach his own deed.' The ejectment is brought by all the heirs, with the exception'of the witness, who was one of them ; but his evidence is not exceptionable for that reason, as it is ruled in Bennett <em>v. </em>Hethington, <a href="/serg-rawl/16/0193-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="16 Serg. &amp; Rawle 193" data-case-ids="1816693" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/16/0193-01">16 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 193</a>, that a tenant in common is a competent witness in an action brought by his co-tenant. Exception is made to the witness on another ground not taken at the trial, viz.: that the purchase money received by the administrator has not been paid over, and if the verdict is in favour of the heirs, it will be retained by him ; thus swearing, as is urged, money into his own pocket. Now, it must <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>be observed, that this point does not arise, as it nowhere appears, in the evidence reported tp us, in whose hands the money now is; whether retained by the administrator, paid over, or unpaid. But suppose it not to be paid over, and still in the hands of the administrator, it is a contingent advantage which may affect his credit but not his competency. ' The witness has no direct interest in the event of the suit, nor can I see how the verdict and judgment could be given in evidence in any suit to which he may hereafter be a party. .</p>
