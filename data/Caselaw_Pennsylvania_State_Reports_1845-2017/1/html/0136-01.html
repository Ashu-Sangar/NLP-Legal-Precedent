Updegrove to Martha Updegrove and William B. Updegrove, dated 26th August, 1835, and from William B. Updegrove to Richard Updegrove, dated the 28th April, 1842, which are in evidence, and made a part of this case. In the deed first referred to, it is set forth that proceedings were had in the Orphans’ Court, whereby his father’s real estate was appraised, and the part now under consideration was accepted by Thomas F. Updegrove, he paying to his brothers and sisters their part of two-thirds of the appraisement within a time fixed, and one-third was charged on the property, the interest of which was to be paid to his mother during her life, and at her death to be distributed amongst the heirs of his father, Jacob Updegrove, deceased. This estate was settled, and the interest of each heir at the death of their mother, the widow of the deceased, was known, or could have been known, by an examination of the records in the Orphans’ Court. These records are referred to in the deed from Thomas F. Updegrove to his mother, Martha, and his brother William B. Updegrove, by which deed he conveys in fee-simple the part of his father’s real estate accepted by him, and introduces into his deed these words: — &lt; <em>Reserving at the same time the interest of the said Thomas F. Updegrove, at the death of the widow of-the said Jacob F. </em>Updegrove.’ By this deed Thomas F. Updegrove conveys to his mother, the widow, and his brother, William B.

Updegrove had nothing in the property tó reserve or except, and that the reservation goes for nothing; that they are mere useless words, without any meaning or effect. That Hie reservation as above expressed is not good, either as a reservation or exception, and many authorities have been collected to sustain that view of the case. A reservation is a clause in a deed, reserving some one thing to a party out of the thing granted, and not in esse before. 4 Kent’s Commentaries, 467. When Thomas F. Updegrove accejDted the land at the valuation, that part of the valuation money coming to himself, whether of the two-thirds to be directly distributed, or that which was to be distributed at the death of his mother, the widow of his deceased father, was paid by the operation of law: he having taken the land at <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>the appraisement, extinguished his own claim upon it. The land could not be debtor to himself, the owner of it. This is well settled by the decisions of our courts in the cases of Reigle <em>v. </em>Seiger, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%20340" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Serg. &amp; Rawle 340">2 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 340</a>, and Stecker <em>v. </em>Shimer, <a href="/whart/5/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Whart. 452" data-case-ids="8878581" data-case-paths="/whart/5/0452-01">5 Wharton, 452</a>. And if he had conveyed the land by deed, such as the one above referred to, without any reservation, or if the land had been sold by the sheriff, on a judgment against him, the property wquld have passed without any lien or claim upon it by Thomas F. Updegrove, for a distributive share in that sum charged upon it for the use of his mother, during her life. Although Thomas F. Updegrove had no lien on this land, he having been paid his share, in contemplation of law, when he accepted it at appraisement ; still no one can doubt but that he had a right, when he sold it, to charge it with the sum of money that would have been coming to him on the death of his mother, provided, he had not accepted it, or with any other sum as a part of the consideration of the grant. In his deed of conveyance, he could have stipulated that $99 80, (his portion of the third that was left charged on the land for the widow’s use, to be distributed at her death,) or any other sum as part of the consideration, should be paid to him at the death of his mother, without interest, or at any other time, and charged the land conveyed with this condition. This deed is a contract between the parties, and must be construed like all other agreements, according to their intentions, where the subject matter is lawful; and frequently parol evidence is introduced to aid a court in ascertaining such intentions, not to alter the written agreement, for that would be to make a new contract, which no court has a right to do. The intention of the parties is what all interpretation must aim at. It is the consenting minds, the concurring thought and will of the parties at the time of the agreement, that courts are called in to aid and support; and no matter what words are used, if the intentions of the parties, when they made the contract, can be gathered from the words used. It is necessary, in giving a construction to written agreements, to take into consideration every thing expressed in the writing, in order to ascertain the intention of the parties to it. If it was understood in this case by the parties, that Thomas F. Updegrove was to convey, and his mother and his brother, William B. Updegrove, were to receive the property conveyed, without any charge upon it for the amount which, by the settlement of the estate, would be coming to Thomas F., after the death of his mother, out of the third charged on the land for his mother’s use, during her life, she being one of the grantees, why did they introduce into the deed the words, ‘ <em>reserving at the same time the interest of the said Thomas F. Updegrove at the death of the widow of Jacob Updegrove. </em>?’ Here Thomas F. <a id="p142" href="#p142" data-label="142" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*142</a>Fpdegrove does not sell the land subject to the claim of the <em>other </em>heirs, or subject to the claim of <em>the </em>heirs of his father, in the part set aside for the widow’s use during her life, as was done in the case of Stecker <em>v. </em>Shimer; but he expressly reserves his own interest in that fund. Under the undisputed facts in the case, can it not be fairly understood from what is written, that this $99 80 was a part of the consideration money agreed upon between the parties, which was to be paid after the death of his mother, without interest ? It is true that this amount was not a lien on the land, Thomas F., the grantor, having accepted it at appraisement; but may it not fairly be said, that the parties made it <em>so </em>by their agreement ? Can any other reason be given for the insertion of these words in Hie deed ? call it a reservation, or agreement, or exception. Badly as the intentions of the parties are expressed, it is difficult to find any other motives for inserting these words, now the subject of consideration. If they did not mean this, what did they mean? We must believe they meant something, or they would not have given these words a place in their contract or deed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b144-4" data-blocks='[["BL_144.4",144,[313,1206,1182,1206]]]'>“ The case of Stecker <em>v. </em>Shimer comes nearest to this case of any in our books. That case turned on the construction of the deed from Stecker to Shimer, wherein Stecker conveyed to Shimer the land, <em>‘ subject to the payment to.the other heirs their equal portion of and in the valuation money aforesaid, and widow’s yearly interest during her life.’ </em>No one suggested that Stecker could not, by his agreement, or deed, have charged the land with that portion set apart for the widow’s dower during her life, which would be coming to himself at her death, if he had provided for it in his deed; notwithstanding, by accepting the land, his claim was paid by operation of law, and no lien upon the land; and even parol evidence was admitted, to show that Stecker did reserve it, which evidence was submitted to the jury. In that case, so far as the deed discovered the contract, the court decided that he had not provided for his own interest in that fund; and Mr. Justice Rogers observes, that if the word <em>‘ </em>other’ had been left out of the deed, it would have made no difference; I presume, on tire ground that Stecker, the grantor, having received his portion of the estate of his father, by accepting the land at appraisement, could no longer be regarded as an heir. In that case there was something to be provided for; something for the reservation to act upon. The land was conveyed subject to the interest of the other heirs in the fund set apart, and charged on the land for the widow, and to be distributed at the death of the widow. Not so in the present case. The other heirs, or their interest, is not noticed; it was the interest of the grantor alone that was noticed, and intended to be protected by this reservation.</p>

This shows, that Thomas F. Updegrove had nothing in this recognisance coming to him, at the death of the widow of his father; nor was William B. Updegrove in a better situation.</p>

An exception is part of the thing granted and of a thing ‘in esse’ at the time; but a reservation is of a thing newly created or reserved out of a thing demised, that was not ‘ in esse’ before; so that this clause doth always reserve that which was not before, oi abridge the tenure of that which was before. 30 Law Lib. 160, 161; 2 Hilliard's Abr. 359, No. 139.</p>

    <p id="b147-4" data-blocks='[["BL_147.4",147,[175,463,1195,1349]]]'>The question is, the effect of the reservation in the deeds amongst the brothers, who knew each one’s share, in the property, payable at the death of their mother. The deeds are indentures, and are the words of either party; and every word that is doubtful must be applied and expounded to be spoken by him to whom they will best refer, according to the <em>interest </em>of the parties. 1 Shep. Touchstone, 54. Webster defines <em>interest </em>to mean share; portion, part, participation in value. It was agreed, that tire share of each heir would be, at the death of the widow, <em>$94 91; a </em>little less than the sum each one would get out of the valuation, the costs having been deducted. The sale was for $1900, and made by Thomas F. Updegrove, about a year after he had taken the property, and showed the sum reserved was a part of the consideration money. If Thomas F. Updegrove had a right to take the property, and sink his share' of the valuation money in it, which cannot be questioned, had he not a right, when he sold to his mother and brother William, to reserve that portion or share which would have been coming to him, if he had never taken the property, on the death of his mother ? The construction ought to be according to the intention of the parties, without too much regard to tire proper definitions and significations of words. A manor may pass by the name of a- messuage. A Shep. Touchst. 87; 3 Atkyns, 136. The construction ought to give effect to the words of the entire deed, so that all the parts might agree, that there be no discordance. 1 Shep. Touchst. 87. Why the reference to the docket of tire Orphans’ Court, unless to show tire land had undergone a change, and their shares had a fixed money value ?
