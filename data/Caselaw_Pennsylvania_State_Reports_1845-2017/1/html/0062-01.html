    <p class="summary" id="b66-5" data-blocks='[["BL_66.5",66,[313,1510,1185,917]],["BL_67.1",67,[154,379,1191,1444]]]'>“This is an action of slander; the plaintiff is a farmer, living upon rented lands; he has proved that the defendant said he was not able to pay his debts, that he owed more than he was worth, and that those whom he owed had better push him, or they would lose by him; it is also proved, that in consequence of these words of the defendant, the plaintiff was sued by several persons, and thus was harassed and put to cost. It does not appear that the plaintiff was unable <em>to </em>pay his debts; there is no evidence that any creditor suffered any loss by him. It is said by the plaintiff that these statements thus made by the defendant were false, and that he knew them to be so when he made them, and that they were made maliciously, and with a design to injure him. Whether the facts proved satisfy you that these things are so or not, is for you to decide from the evidence. Whether, if you believe all these things to be.true, it is actionable, is a question of law which the court will determine; the facts you will decide for yourselves, without being bound in any way by what I may have <em>said </em>in relation to them. The law looks upon credit with care and tenderness, as essential to trade and business generally. Formerly words imputing want of credit, to be actionable, must have imputed bankruptcy. This restricted this kind <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>of verbal slander to words spoken against merchants. This notion was very soon exploded, and this narrow doctrine abandoned for one that was more just and sensible, and was declared to extend to imputations against the credit of persons engaged in <em>any business. </em>This rule now applies not only'to merchants, but also to-persons engaged in all trades and mechanical pirrsuits. Why should it not apply to farmers and husbandmen? credit is important to them; their sensibility on this point is as tender as is that of any other class in the community; their sense of honour is as bright and correct on the question of credit as any. men’s. Why then is it not to be equally cared for, respected, and protected ? I imagine that no satisfactory reason could be given for an invidious distinction against the husbandman. The loss of credit bears as injuriously upon him as upon any man. His means of living and the subsistence of his family are as much endangered by its loss as are those of any class of our labouring community; his business and his occupation is an important branch of industry. The larger portion of our people is engaged in active agriculture; is not character and credit as dear to this class as it is to merchants, tradesmen, or mechanics ? The malignity which wantonly assails the one, is as culpable as that which ássails the other; why then should not the same rule apply to all ? There is no substantial difference, and there should be no distinction in the rule of security and protection. In Starkie on Slander, at p. 119, we have an authority to the very point now at issue. There we have the case of a defendant who said of a husbandman, ‘He owes more than he is worth; he is a runaway.’ These words were held to be actionable. The counsel have not taken the trouble to prepare any authorities on either side. I have, therefore, been obliged to cast around for such authorities as came within my reach in the hurry of the trial. I adopt this as law in this case, and will apply it in the following form and terms :</p>

      <em>11 </em>If you believe that the defendant made it his business to slander the credit of the plaintiff; that his object in so doing was to injure him; that this was his purpose; that the charges were false, and that he knew them to be so at the time he gave utterance to them; that he made them maliciously, and that in consequence of them being so made, the plaintiff was sued and put to trouble and costs, then, and in that case only are the words proven to have been spoken by the defendant of the plaintiff actionable, and then and in that case only will you render a verdict for the plaintiff for such sum in damages, as you think right under all the circumstances of the case.”</p>

    <p id="b68-8" data-blocks='[["BL_68.8",68,[311,962,1181,625]]]'>The cause now under discussion will lead us to examine that class of cases where the words spoken and charged injuriously affect a man’s office, business, or profession. In order to malee such words slanderous, it must appear that the words spoken have a direct, plain, and unquestionable allusion to a man’s business or profession. Words spoken generally of a man, that may incidentally and only remotely affect his business reputation, cannot be brought into this class of cases; and therefore we say, that the words laid in the declaration, and proved at the trial, are not actionable, because they do not refer to the business or profession of the plaintiff; had no reference to anything whatever, except that the plaintiff owed almost everybody, and that unless his neighbours looked to it, they might lose their money. Almost all the cases cited in Starkie, 74, are put expressly on this ground.</p>
    <p id="b68-9" data-blocks='[["BL_68.9",68,[311,1592,1182,184]]]'>Again, words to be actionable in themselves must intend to injure prospectively, and must, therefore, attack a man’s integrity, skill, diligence, credit, or in some direct and positive way the subject-matter in which he deals.

    <p id="b68-10" data-blocks='[["BL_68.10",68,[311,1784,1181,419]]]'>The words must also be false and unfounded. The words proved by the testimony are very different from the words repeated in the charge of the judge to the jury. It was not every thing that the defendant said of the plaintiff that was false and unfounded; he did not put into circulation a gratuitous and false report, and to people with whom the plaintiff had nothing to do; but as far as the testimony goes, he only spoke to such as were creditors of the plaintiff. If what was said was calculated to hurt the plaintiff, it was also calculated to benefit his creditors.</p>

A farmer wants no <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>credit. Whatever he sells, he sells for cash. The merchant, tlmtrader, all who buy and sell want credit; but not so the farmer.\</p>
    <p id="b69-4" data-blocks='[["BL_69.4",69,[142,476,1192,920]]]'>Again, words not actionable in themselves become so by reason of special damage. In this case the plaintiff’s counsel has put his right to recover on the ground of special damage, and such is the allegation in the declaration. But the judge in one part of his charge puts the right of recovery on the ground, that the words charged in the declaration are actionable in themselves, without proof of special damage; and in another part, that they became so by reason of special damage. Neither the declaration nor the charge of the court represent this case to have been of an actionable character. It is not sufficient to bring a case within the true rule of law, that the declaration has been correctly framed; the allegation contained in it must be supported by the evidence. That the plaintiff was sued, harassed, and put to great expense, &amp;c., is set out as part, of the special damage, and to this the witnesses testify. The damage must be the immediate consequence of the slander; but the plaintiff would not have been sued if he had not been in debt. He was not sued because the defendant said he was in debt, &amp;e., but because he owed money to the people who sued him; These actions ought not to be encouraged, because they are against the policy of good laws.</p>

One of the objects of Phillips in slandering Hcefer, was to get him to leave his farm before his lease had expired; and as a means of accomplishing this, he wished to break him up.
