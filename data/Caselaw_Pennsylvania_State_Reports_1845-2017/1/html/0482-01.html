These surveys were returned and accepted, the first on the 3d July, 1822, and the other on the 20th of February, 1820, or 1821. These warrants, surveys, and returns have been given in evidence by the plaintiff,' with the will of R. Morris and Mary Morris his wife, and a deed from Henry Nixon and Maria his wife, to E. Heath, the plaintiff for the lands in controversy; It is contended by the plaintiff that all acts done in pursuance of these warrants will be presumed to have been done for the warrantee, and will inure to the be. nefit of him and his devisees. In the absence of all evidence to rebut this presumption, it is so to be presumed; and the plaintiff has made out his case, and shown a good legal title. The defendant, however, has given evidence, which, if believed, prove that those warrants, not long after they were issued in the name of Robert Morris, and in the name of John Nicholson, were placed.in the hands of the deputy surveyor by Thomas Grant, who stated that he was agent for the owners, and had the direction or care of the location; part of the warrants under his care were located, and subsequently drawn between Morris and Nicholson, Grant and Nixon. The returns on the warrant in controversy and some of the others were not satisfactory, and still remained in the hands of the surveyor, Wm. P. Brady. In the month of August, 1802, they were taken out of his hands by Thomas Grant, and by him delivered to the sheriff of Northumberland county, by whom they were sold, as the property of Robert Morris and John Nicholson, to Thomas Grant, on the 30th of August, 1802, who subsequently placed them in the hands of Wm. P. Brady as his own property. The executors of Thos. Grant, in July, 1818, conveyed to Wm. P. Brady these warrants, by whom they were some time before located on the land in controversy; and the lines by which the land is claimed were marked on the ground. At the time he made the survey, he was not the deputy sur. veyor, nor had he any authority from him. The surveys were, however, afterwards examined and approved by the deputy surveyor, Mr. Taylor, and by him returned as surveyed, on the 26th of August, 1820. The surveying fees, and all expenses for making the surveys, were paid, or <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>borne by or for the parties for whom the surveys were made, to wit, Hugh Brady and Alexander W. Fosterand a patent from the Commonwealth, for No. 3701, granted to Alexander W. Foster on the 16th of April, 1823, who paid the patent fees, the purchase, and the interest for the surplus land over one thousand acres included in the survey. Hugh Brady conveyed to the present defendants, by a deed or assignment in writing, dated the 7th of April, 1834; Alexander W. Foster, by a deed dated the 3d of May, 1832. It is not pretended that they had any right to levy or sell those warrants.; the sale was void, and gave no title, but the defendants were permitted to prove the sale and subsequent possession and location of the warrants, to show that from the 30th of August, 1802, they were claimed adversely to Robert Morris and his devisees for a period of almost thirty-seven years. We have no evidence that R. Morris, his devisees, or any person for them, have taken any steps to perfect a title in any land in pursuance of these warrants, except the declarations of Thomas Grant in 1793, when he placed the warrants in the hands of the deputy surveyor. Those declarations prove the warrants in question belonged to Morris and Nicholson. If so, the oath of Robert Morris is conclusive, that he had no interest in them at the time the commission of bankruptcy issued. If you believe that the defendants, and those under whom they claim, have had the possession of those <em>f </em>warrants, and have been exercising acts- of ownership over them, such as procuring the survey, return and acceptance, paying the fees, expenses, &amp;e., adverse to the claim of R. Morris and his devisee, and not for them, you may and ought to presume a release or abandonment in favour of the defendants, even if the warrants were not held in partnership.</p>

The use made of the admission of the record, as would seem from the charge of the court, was to show an equitable title in John Nicholson; but for this purpose was wholly immaterial, for, admitting that he had an equitable title, that is no defence. The suit is brought in the name of the person who owns the legal title, and, in Hart <em>v. </em>Cranford, 3 Penna. Rep. 426, it is ruled that a trustee of land maymaintain ejectment for the recovery; and the wrongdoer cannot set up the title of the cestui que trust to defeat the recovery of the trustee. In this state, where we have no Court of Chancery, the cestui que trust may bring the action in his own name, or in the name of the trustee. Jt is not intimated by Robert Morris that he made a legal transfer of his interest in this warrant to John Nicholson. All he says is, The late John Nicholson and myself had purchased .and acquired rights to large quantities of land, lying within the slate of Pennsylvania, yhich are held jointly; but in March, 1794,1 sold my half of all said lands to him, and he is charged on my books accordingly, The court say, We <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>have no evidence that R. Morris, his devisees, or any person for them, has taken any steps to perfect a title in any lands, in pursuance of these warrants, except the declaration of Thomas Grant, in 1793, when he placed the warrants in the hands of the deputy surveyor. These declarations prove the warrants in question belonged to Morris and Nicholson. If so, the oath of Robert Morris is conclusive, that he had no interest in them at the time of the commission of bankruptcy. Although the court do not say so in terms, it is clearly intimated to the jury, that if they believe John Nicholson was the owner of the warrant, the defendant was entitled to a verdict. But the conclusion was a non-sequitur, as appears, by the cases cited. The record was not properly admitted, as bearing on the allegation of abandonment, for, if it proves any thing, it shows that there was no intention to abandon the interest in the warrant, particularly in favour of a third person.</p>
    <p id="b494-3" data-blocks='[["BL_494.4",494,[299,1080,1189,721]]]'>The court charged the jury, that if they believed that the defendants, and those under whom they claimed, have had possession of the warrants, have been exercising act of ownership over them, such as procuring a survey, return and acceptance, paying <em>the fees, expenses, </em>&amp;c., adverse to the claim of Robert Morris, and his devisees, and not for them, they might and ought to presume a release or abandonment in favour of the defendants. At the time this case was tried, the Supreme Court had not decided Orr <em>v. </em>Cunningham, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0294-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 294" data-case-ids="1856359" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0294-01">4 Watts &amp; Serg. 294</a>, where the law, on facts nearly if not precisely the same as here, was ruled otherwise. It is there held that a title may be lost by abandonment; ' and if so, it falls back to the state, but is never thereby transferred to an adverse claimant. Nor can the stranger, who discovers another unsatisfied warrant in the hands of the deputy surveyor, or elsewhere, after any lapse of time from its date, assume the ownership of it, and have it surveyed for himself.</p>
    <p id="b494-5" data-blocks='[["BL_494.5",494,[307,1806,1182,625]]]'>We think the court was wrong in qualifying their answer to the plaintiff’s first point, and in the answer to the second point. The court should have instructed the jury, that the plaintiff had shown a good and legal title to the warrant and survey; that at the time the warrants were surveyed, they were the property of Mary Morris, the devisee of Robert Morris, and that the survey made in pursuance thereof inured, to her benefit. It is true, that superintending a survey or paying the fees is sufficient evidence of ownership of the application or warrant upon which it is made, but it may be rebutted by evidence of ownership, in the person in -whose name the application was entered, or the warrant was issued. Time <em>v. </em>Waterson, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0171-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 171" data-case-ids="1856454" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0171-01">4 Watts &amp; Serg. 171</a>.
