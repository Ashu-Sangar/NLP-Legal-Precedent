This would, undoubtedly, be the case if the words of the act had been viz. — to wit — as it is a well known rule of legal construction, that the <em>videlicet </em>is used for the purpose of restraining the generality of the preceding term, or of qualifying it, and even of contradicting it. But the word <em>whether, </em>neither in common parlance, nor in legal phraseology, has ever had the force of a <em>videlicet. </em>In fact, this section of the act is ungrammatical, and the proposition contained in the sentence is what is called by critics an anacolouthon — an incomplete proposition. The <em>whether, </em>as used here, requires some correlative — generally, the word <em>or. </em>But, suppose the word <em>or </em>to have been inserted between each of the classes enumerated, and thus the sentence made grammatical, yet it could not follow that the enumeration of some particulars would be an exclusion of all others', under the rule ‘ expressio unius est exclusio alteráis,’ as if the viz. had been used.</p>

But, I think, the properly in this case comes- fairly under the description of the act, although the term articles of agreement has not been used. That it was the intention of the legislature to tax money due on mortgage, where the creditor has his money secured by a transfer of real property, and <em>not to tax it </em>where the creditor held a security different in form, but precisely the same in effect, (as in the case of land sold by articles of agreement,) cannot for a moment be supposed. Why, then, should we not give these words a liberal construction, to effectuate their intention ?</p>

What is an article of agreement, signed and sealed by the parlies ? It is a deed — ■ an indenture bipartite. The vendee holds the part signed by the vendor, in which he covenants to make him a title to a certain tract of land. The vendor holds his as the covenant or bond of the vendee to pay him a eertaia sum of money. It is true, that in modem times no counterpart or second original of such deeds is usually made. Yet, in fact, the article of agreement, so far as the vendor is concerned with it, is as the bond or obligation of the vendee. <em>&lt;■ </em>A bond or obligation is defined to be a deed whereby the obligor binds or obliges himself, <a id="p333" href="#p333" data-label="333" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*333</a>his heirs, executors, add- administrators to pay a certain sum of money at a particular day.’ 2 Black.

Is not this money at interest ? What does it matter under what form the security is held ? Because it is the purchase money of land, it is none the less money at interest. The defendant- has contracted to sell his land for a certain sum of money — - he prefers to have his money out at interest, on good security. Pie holds the title to the land only as security for his money. He is no longer the owner of the land in fact, but the vendee, who has the possession and pays the taxes, and to whose heirs the land would descend <em>as land. </em>And, although the' bare legal title to this land would descend to the heirs of the vendor, it would be only (as in case of a mortgage) in trust for those entitled to receive the money, which would go to the executors or administrators.</p>

What good reason can be given why defendant should no.t pay his tax for this money,.which produces him an income of some $&gt;3500 per annum ? — because Painter &amp; Warner are his debtors, when it is admitted if they had paid him, and he had lent the money to others at interest, it would have been liable to taxation, under the letter of this act. The mode or form of security on the origin of the debt cannot alter the case, and although it be Hie price of land and secured on land, it is none the less money at interest. The rule of construction of statutes is, that the words of a statute are to be taken in their ordinary and familiar signification and import, and regard is to be had to their general and popular uses, for jus et norma loquendi is governed by usage, and the meaning of words spoken and written ought to be allowed to be, as it has constantly been taken to be, loquendum est ut vulgus. 4 Rep. 47; Vaughan, 169; Dwarris on Statutes, 702.</p>
