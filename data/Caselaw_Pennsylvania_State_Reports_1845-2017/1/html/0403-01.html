Denny, «that deponent was in back room of Mr. Inghram’s tavern, and plaintiff came in and served a notice on defendant. I heard the notice read, or most of it; it was concerning the defendant marrying the plaintiff’s daughter; plaintiff seemed much agitated when reading, and after it was read, I believe he told me to take notice, and defendant said it was good, or the service was good. I do not recollect whether plaintiff left a copy of the notice. This paper is similar to what I heard read; I did not hear it all, but what I did hear is in that paper. I don’t know that I can tell in what month it was, or that this is the notice.”</p>

To the admission of this evidence, the counsel of the defendant objected. The court sustained the objection, and sealed a bill of exceptions. The plaintiff thereupon took a writ of error, and assigned for error in this court the rejection of the plaintiff as a witness to prove the service of notice on the defendant, and in not permitting the written notice to be read, after the testimony of M. Denny..</p>

It is unnecessary, therefore, to do more than refer to that case. As to the proof received, it is enough to say, that it fell short. The witness did not pretend to identify the notice that was read in the defendant’s presence; neither could he specify the day, nor say whether it was within the proper period. The plaintiff, therefore, signally failed.</p>
