On the 23d of July, the day after withdrawing his first suit, A. instituted a now suit against B. for the same cause of action, and obtained a second judgment, from which B. appealed to the Court of Common Pleas, jyhere he pleaded the judgment in the first suit against him as a bar to the second action for the same cause, whereupon A. suffered anonsuit.

The plaintiff being satisfied that it was improper for the justice to enter judgment by default against defendant, without notifying the defendant of the day to which the cause was adjourned; and having been apprised that defendant had taken an appeal, and wishing to avoid the consequences of that error of the justice, in case the appeal should be carried up, went to the office of the justice on the 22d day of July, one month after the appeal was taken, requested the justice'to enter on the docket, “the above suit withdrawn by order of the plaintiff;” and the first question is, what is the effect of this entry on the docket on the rights of the parties ? At the time this entry was made, the justice had no jurisdiction over the cause whatever. Therefore it was not a <em>judicial act of </em>the justice, and could not, as such, prejudice either party. It was then the act of the-party-alone, who has acted mistakingly in supposing he could withdraw the <em>suit </em>after <em>judgment </em>and appeal <em>taleen </em>by defendant. Withdrawing or discontinuing- a suit, requires the permission of the court before which the cause is <em>pending. </em>The suit was <em>not pending </em>before the justice, because judgment had been entered and appeal taken. It was not <em>pending </em>in the Common Pleas, because the appeal had not then been entered there; but the jurisdiction of the justice was suspended until after the first day of the next term of the Common Pleas. During this interim the plaintiff brought a second suit for the same cause of action; the defendant pleads the first suit in bar, but the justice, supposing the first suit withdrawn, enters judgment against defendant, from which he also appeals, which is entered in the Common Pleas. The court will observe that the defendant has both transcripts at the same time, and could have <em>made </em>his appeal on both, if he chose, at the same term; but instead of filing the appeal in the first case, he prefers making his appeal in the second suit, and affirming the first judgment before the justice, which he does by pleading the first suit,'and judgment in bar to a recovery in the second suit, and by so doing, the plaintiff contends, that the defendant is estopped from gainsaying the validity of the first judgment on this scire facias. Of this we think the defendant cannot complain, as he has twice had the privilege of having the cause tried on its merits.</p>

It appears that the plaintiff in error appealed, on the 22d of the same month, from tire judgment, on which the scire facias in this case was sued out, to the Court of Common Pleas of the county. That after the plaintiff in error appealed, the defendant in error, on the 22d of July, directed the justice to make the following entry: “The above suit-withdrawnby order of plaintiff this 22d day of July, a. d. 1839.” Whereupon notice was issued from the justice, the same day, notifying the defendant of the withdrawal by the plaintiff, which was afterwards returned served by the constable. After this, the plaintiff in error obtained a transcript of the judgment, and his appeal therefrom, certified by the justice in due form, as if he intended filing it in the Prothonotary’s office, on or before the first day of the next term of the Court of Common Pleas of the county, which was necessary if he intended prosecuting his appeal with effect. He, however, did not file it; by reason whereof his appeal became of no effect. But <em>before </em>the first of the next term came around, the defendant in error, on the 23d of July, 1839, the next day after he withdrew his suit before the justice, commenced a second action for the same cause, before the same justice of the peace, in -which he obtained a second judgment against the plaintiff in error, from which the latter appealed to the Court of Common Pleas of the county, where he pleaded the judgment in the first action against him as a bar to the second action- for the same cause ; and that the judgment so obtained was and continued in full force and unreversed. That the defendant in error, not being willing to encounter this plea, took a nonsuit in his second action; after which he sued out the scire facias in this case, on his first judgment, from which the plaintiff in error appealed, but failed to prosecute it. The justice, in this case, rendered a judgment in favour of the defendant in error, against the plaintiff in error, for the amount of the first judgment with interest thereon, and the costs of the same. The plaintiff in error, after having brought this case into the court below by appeal from the judgment of the justice of the peace, pleaded the withdrawal of the original suit by the defendant in error, as a bar to all further proceeding therein by him. The defendant in error, in reply thereto, alleged, that the plaintiff in error had pleaded the judgment, on which the scire facias was sued out in this case, as a bar to the second suit, brought against him by the defendant in error for the same cause, averring itto be in full force, and that he was therefore estopped from denying the existence, validity, or force of it, and was, consequently, bound to <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>pay it, unless he would show that it was paid, which was not pretended. The court below took this view of the case, and accordingly instructed the jury that the plaintiff there was entitled to recover. To this instruction of the court, the counsel of the defendant below excepted, and have assigned it here for error. It is unnecessary to say what would have been the effect of the defendant in error’s withdrawal of the original suit in this case before the justice of the peace; whether it would have amounted to a retraxit or not, if the plaintiff in error had' considered and pleaded it as such, in the second action brought against him for the same cause. But instead of doing this, he seems to have considered the judgment rendered therein as being still in full force, notwithstanding the withdrawal, and certainly treated it so by pleading it as such in bar to the second action. Having thus pleaded it as a judgment in full force, he thereby estopped himself from denying it afterwards; and .not having shown in the trial, that it was reversed, released, paid, or in any way satisfied, we think the court below charged the jury correctly in telling them that the defendant in error was entitled to recover.
