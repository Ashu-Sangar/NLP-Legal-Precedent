That he had no interest, directly or indirectly, nor any liability arising out of the determination of the suit. The competency of John D. Mahon as a witness was objected to by defendants. The court overruled the 'objection, and this the plaintiffs now assign as error.</p>

He ought therefore to have been rejected as a witness, whether his transfer to the equitable plaintiff were real or fictitious. Nor could his testimony be. .received for purposes of corroboration. If he could make out his case without it, he would not need it; and the objection to it would remain. Indeed the time is come when the doctrine in Steel <em>v. </em>The Phoenix Insurance Company must be exploded altogether. The essential interests of justice demand, that the decision in that case be no longer a precedent for any thing whatever. It is immaterial, therefore, that the plaintiff transferred the cause of action in payment of a debt and without responsibility for the event: for he was not the less incompetent, for it, to testify in support of it.</p>
