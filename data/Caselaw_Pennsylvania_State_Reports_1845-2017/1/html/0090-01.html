On the 14th of December, 1844, Lydia Ann Hoch, widow of the said Abraham Hoch, deceased, presented her petition to the Orphans’ Court of Berks county, setting forth: “That her said husband died on the 26th of May, 1844, possessed of a large amount of real and personal property; and that he left a daughter, a minor of the age of six years, for whom he appointed, by his will, Jacob Shilling as one of her guardians.” She further represented, “that the said Jacob Shilling entered upon the duties of his trust, and that he was then wasting and mismanaging the estate of the said ward, and if suffered to continue in the said trust, the estate of the said ward will be greatly diminished, and that at a great loss; and that she was the mother of the said Mary Ann Hoch; she therefore prays the court to award a citation to issue to the said Jacob Shilling, to show cause why he should not be discharged from his said trust as guardian.”</p>

That Shilling was removed without a hearing; and that the Orphans’ Court had no power to remove, until there was a hearing and legal evidence submitted of mismanagement by the guardian. That no mismanagement or wasting of the minor’s estate was proved. He cited the 12th section of the act of 29th of March, 1832, Purdon's Digest, 809.</p>

That the causes submitted to the court for the removal or discharge of Shilling, were disagreement and litigation between him and his colleague Beidler.

That upon the return of the citation, he had made a statement of the causes upon which they asked the guardians to be dismissed, and that it was admitted to be correct and true.</p>

The facts set forth in the complaint ought not to have been taken <em>pro confesso, </em>merely because the respondent neglected or refused to answer. All that the court could do in his absence was, to proceed ex parte and judge how far the complaint was sustained by the evidence of his antagonist. Again, it was irregular to remove the two guardians on a complaint against one of them. It is suggested that the one who would be injuriously affgeted by the order was present, and consented to it. But of this we know nothing; and if he was willing to relinquish the trust, the regular way was to settle his account and resign.</p>
