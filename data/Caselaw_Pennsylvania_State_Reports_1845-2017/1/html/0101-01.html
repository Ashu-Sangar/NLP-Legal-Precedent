That on the 7th day of February, 1843, Joseph Dohner, the defendant, and wife, by their indenture of that date, conveyed their estate, real and personal, to James Brubaker and John Dohner, in trust for the benefit of his creditors. That the assignees filed their account, which was confirmed by the court, and an auditor appointed to make distribution of the balance remaining in the hands of the assignees. The auditor in his report allowed the payment in full of the judgment of George Redseeker, deceased; and to this appropriation of a considerable part of the fund to be distributed, exceptions were filed in the court below. The exceptants objected to the payment of this judgment, on the ground that it was irregularly revived, and had lost its lien upon the real estate which passed under the assignment; because the assignees, who, as they alleged were the terre-tenants, were not made parties to the scire facias.</p>

Miller, 1 Penna. R. 72. The assignees are not tenants in fee; they are merely trustees and hold in trust for the benefit of creditors; and neither could they be prejudiced by the judgment, for they pay the purchase money or assets to whomsoever it is decreed by the auditor or the court, and therefore do not come within the case of bona fide purchasers for a valuable consideration. They hold the land for the benefit of creditors, and to what creditor the money may be decreed is a matter of indifference to them.

Dohner, on whom the service was made, was not only the debtor, but he was in the actual occupation of the premises at the time. By tenants is meant the owners of the fee-simple; and by occupiers, those who come in under them. 2 Saund. 7 &amp; 9. And in this sense, the terms are used in the third section of the act of 1798. The act of Assembly is in the alternative, and' the writ is well served, either on the occupier or the owner of the fee-simple. If on the former, the presumption is, as it his duty, the tenant will give notice to those under whom he claims. Clippinger <em>v. </em>Miller, 1 Penna. Rep. 71. Dohner was the owner of the fee-simple, and assigned his property for the benefit of his creditors, at the same time retaining the possession; consequently, he has a resulting interest in the estate real and personal, it being conveyed for a special purpose only. It is, therefore, unlike ■the case of Lusk <em>v. </em>Davidson, 3 Penna. Rep. 229, where it is held to be essential, in order to the continuance of the lien of a judgment on land which has been sold and conveyed, that the terre-tenants be made a party to the scire facias. A general assignee for the benefit of creditors is not a purchaser, as is decided in Vandyke <em>v. </em>Christ, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0373-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 373" data-case-ids="481840" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0373-01">7 Watts &amp; Serg. 373</a>, and in Twelves <em>v. </em>Williams, <a href="/whart/3/0485-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Whart. 485" data-case-ids="1833435" data-case-paths="/whart/3/0485-01">3 Wh. 485</a>. In one sense Dohner is still the owner of the fee, for the assignees are but his agents to pay the debts and return the surplus if any remain, to himself. We must not throw unnecessary difficulties in the way of creditors. Here the judgment creditor had but the notice implied from recording the assignment. But we do not put the case on that point, for even if he had express notice, we think the service would be good notwithstanding.</p>
