John Rick on the same day bound himself in the sum of $4000, as security for the tenants, and for their performance of the terms of the lease on their part.

In this agreement the tenants, with Reber, bound themselves to the performance of certain conditions contained in the lease; and for their non-performance Gilson brought an action of covenant against the tenants, to November term, 1839.

The estate of the obligor could derive no possible benefit whatever from the continuance of the lease, however favourable or advantageous it might have been for the lessees. But it is pretty obvious, that much greater injury might have accrued to the estate, at the end of five years, than has, or is likely to arise, at the end of two.

The lessees, as it appears, fell indebted and in arrears to the lessor nearly two hundred dollars, at the end of the first two years, which, it seems, they are wholly unable to pay, and if paid at all, must be paid by the estate of the deceased obligor. And what in all probability would have been the result, and the amount that the estate would have been called on to pay at'the end of the five years, if the lessees had continued in the possession and enjoyment of the leased premises during that period ? If the administrator had any reason to believe that the • estate of his intestate would be injured by the liability to which it was subject under the bond, and that the longer that liability continued, the worse it would be for the estate; it was certainly his duty to endeavour to relieve it from such liability, as early as an opportunity should present itself to him to do so. But it has been objected, if the agreement of the administrator be held to be binding on the estate, that it subjects it to a new and additional liability that did not exist under the obligation of the intestate, by requiring the lessees to have the eighty loads of manure deposited in the yard, and the eighty-two loads hauled out on the land at the end of two years, instead of five years; as also by requiring the ploughing, harrowing, and other things therein mentioned to be done and furnished, at the end of the two years, instead of the five. Nothing, however, is required to be done by the new agreement, more than was required by the original agreement, excepting, that the leased premises are to be left in the same condition at the end of the two years that they were to have been left in, at the end of five years, by the original agreement. But it is highly probable, that if the lessees had managed the leased premises as they ought to have done for their own interests, that they would have had every thing done at the end of each succeeding year that was to be done at the end of the five years, according to the terms of the lease. And if it would have been for their benefit to have done so, it would seem to be fair to infer that it would also have tended to lessen, if not to" prevent, the estate of the obligor from being rendered liable to pay any thing on their account. Be this, howTever, as it may, it has not been shown that the second agreement required the lessees to do or perform any thing that would not have been for their advantage to .have done, without its having been made. It cannot, therefore, under any view that can be fairly taken of the case, and the circumstances attending it, be considered that the second agreement, to which the <a id="p62" href="#p62" data-label="62" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*62</a>administrator was consenting, tended in the slightest degree to increase the liability of the estate of the obligor; but, on the contrary, had a direct tendency to diminish it, by obtaining what was, in effect, a release of it from the three-fifths of the time to which, otherwise, it must inevitably have been exposed. The second agreement, being regarded then as a release of the estate from its liability,- in a matter from which it could derive no possible advantage, must be considered beneficial and not injurious to it, and such as the administrator was clearly authorized to make. It was, therefore, not only properly received in evidence, together with the record of the recovery against the lessees, but the legal effect of it properly explained and declared by the court to the jury.</p>
