Duncan, authorized a certain John Fessler to build, at his own expense, a house, of such materials and dimensions as he should think proper, on D.uncan’s small island, at the mouth of the Juniata. After the house was finished, they were to fix upon the length of time that he (Fessler) was to continue in the occupation thereof to indemnify himself for the improvement: this, however, was never settled. Fessler went on, erected his house, and moved into it in April, 1840, before it was entirely completed. On the 31st of December, 1840, Rebecca H. Duncan entered into articles of agreement with Rody McGee, under which she sold to him a tract of land in said island, which included within its boundaries the property in dispute. On the back of the article of agreement was the following endorsement: <em>“ This article is subject to lease of Daniel P. Reif, as also John Fessler is to have the privilege of removing his house. Mr. McGee is to receive the rents after the 1st of January, </em>1841.” It was alleged before the justices and inquest, that McGee and Fessler had entered into some parol agreement after McGee had purchased, by which the time Fessler was to occupy was settled. There was no proof of this agreement; nor was there evidence of any rent agreed upon and reserved by the parties, or any of them.</p>

The court below reversed the proceedings, because the justices and jury omitted to state that the demise was <em>voider certain rents. </em>It was indispensable to the validity of the proceedings, that the justices and jury should have certified and found that the property was demised <em>under an improvement lease. </em>He contended that it was not necessary to state the terms of the lease; that the word <em>demise </em>is used in the' statute as synonymous with the word <em>lease, </em>and imports a lease of the property on a return of a profit, or certain rent. Purdon, 927. In 2 Institutes, 483, “ demise” is defined to be the conveyance of an estate for a term of life or years. In Burn’s Law Diet., title <em>Rent, </em>“ rent” is stated to be a certain profit issuing yearly out of lands, &amp;c. And in the same book, title <em>Lease, </em>“lease” is defined to be a conveyance of lands and tenements, in <em>consideration of rent </em>for life or years, or at will.</p>

He argued that the provisions of the act had been substantially complied with, and that it was not necessary for the justices or the jury to set forth the nature, quality, and kind of rent. In’ support of this position he cited Scott <em>v. </em>Fuller, 3 Penna.

The act of the 21st of March, 1772, which gives a summary remedy to a landlord, only applies to leases on which a certain rent is reserved. Blashford <em>v. </em>Duncan, <a href="/serg-rawl/2/0480-01" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="2 Serg. &amp; Rawle 480" data-case-ids="1798292" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/2/0480-01">2 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 480</a>. And it is held,-in divers cases, that all the facts necessary to give jurisdiction should be set out in the proceedings. But it nowhere appears <a id="p131" href="#p131" data-label="131" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*131</a>on this record what the lease was; whether an improvement lease, as it is alleged to be, a rent in kind, for a sum certain or certain time, or whether there was any rent whatever reserved. For this reason, the court could not do otherwise than set aside the inquest. It is said that the word <em>demise </em>is used in the act as a synonym with lease. Be it so, still the objection remains, that there is no averment that McGee leased the premises to Fessler at a certain rent. Indeed, this would not seem to have arisen from the blunder of the justices and the inquest. It was not made, because it could not be proved. Doctor Thomas Duncan, who acted as the agent of his mother, the then owner of the premises demised, authorized Fessler to build on the lot, but there was no agreement at that time, or afterwards, as to the kind of building, its size, or the materials of which it was to be composed, nor any understanding as to the yearly value of the ground. The rent, if rent it may be called,, was altogether uncertain; nor was there any thing by which it could be rendered certain, except by the intervention of a jury. It would seem, therefore, to be a case in which the legislature did not intend to give a summary jurisdiction. This jurisdiction is confined to plain cases, particularly designated and pointed out in the act. The plaintiff’s remedy is by action of ejectment. We also think the court was right in ordering restitution. The court may, after a writ of possession, refuse the writ in special cases, as where the proceedings are reversed on an exception, which has ceased to exist. When it is manifest to the court, that there was a lease for a certain rent which is ended, and that the landlord is entitled to possession, it would be worse than useless to turn the landlord out and put him to the trouble of another proceeding, which must necessarily result in the eviction of the tenant.</p>
