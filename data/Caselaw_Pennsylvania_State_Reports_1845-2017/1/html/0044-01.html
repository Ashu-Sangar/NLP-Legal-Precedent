The boat was stopped when she arrived at a convenient place on the farm, and laid against the berm bank of the canal, for the purpose of unloading the lime. Whilst the hands were engaged in unloading, the defendants’ boat, which was loaded, descended the canal, and at the same time an ascending empty boat approached the place where the boat of the plaintiffs lay moored. Neither boat stopped, and they came in contact, just as the empty boat had passed that of the plaintiffs. The collision between the two caused the defendants’ boat to taire a sheer in the direction of the plaintiffs’, which she ran against and stove in.</p>

      <em>place to do this </em>— a place that was so wide that other boats could pass with safety. It was likewise their duty to have their boat thrown close to the berm bank side of the canal at both ends. If these things were not carefully done by those who had charge of her, and an injury was sustained by reason of their not being done, the loss must be the plaintiffs’, asffhe fault was theirs. Was the place where the plaintiffs’ boat lay, a convenient place ? Did the boat remain there an unreasonable time ? Was she moored so as to lay close to the berm bank side of the canal? When an ascending boat, and one descending, are to pass near, or at a narrow point in the canal, the ascending boat should stop at a distance below the narrows, so that the descending boat may pass safely. When these two boats approached the plaintiffs’, neither stopped. The captain of the defendants’ boat, it seems, entertained the opinion that it was the duty of the captain of the ascending boat to stop, and let him pass. He therefore pressed his boat ahead and made no effort to stop her. Delays on the canal must necessarily occur; something may go wrong; it may be necessary to take in loading or 'put it off. In such cases, care should be taken to leave room for others to pass, as I have already said. When others do pass, they should take care to pass without doing any injury. When those two boats met as they did, the persons in charge of each boat should have been on their guard; they might have known that there was danger in the attempt thus to pass the plaintiffs’ boat. The persons in charge of the defendants’ boat should not have <em>forced her </em>on, <em>until they saw that the other had stopped^ </em>until she approached so near to plaintiffs’ that danger was inevitable. , It will not excuse the defendants; they should have looked out for danger in time, and guarded against it while it was possible to do so. They should have kept their boat at such a distance as to have been under their control, so as to insure safety. If they did not do so,(but ran her on so near to the plaintiffs’ that it becamé impossible for them to manage her, so as to prevent collision, it was their fault. Putting their boat in this position was carelessness, a want of due caution and ordinary care, and the defendants would be answerable for all damages done to the plaintiffs’ property by reason of it. Men engaged on the canal should enjoy the rights that others have, and' should regard them, and if they do not, their employers should be made to smart for it. This alone will make our navigation safe. Where so much that is valuable is transported, public policy demands that reasonable care should be more rigidly exacted from all engaged as hands on the lines. The facts are left for your decision. Was there a want of reasonable care on the part of tiróse having charge of the defendants’ boat, and was this injury to the plaintiffs’ boat the result of this want <a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>of care, without any negligence or want of care on the ■ part of those who had charge of the plaintiffs’ boat ?

If the plaintiff was innocent in every respect, and sustained damage by the default of others navigating the canal, he is entitled to indemnity from some of them, and possibly from all concerned, had he chosen to join them. It is contended by the plaintiffs in error, that as it was the duty of the ascending boat,'by'the act of 10th April, 1826, to wait at a narrow place in the canal till the descending boat had passed, tire former only was answerable to plaintiff and not the latter. As between themselves, no doubt this direction of the act would settle the matter, had the descending boat been injured by non-compliañce with the law on the part of the ascending boat. But when a third boat is concerned, there is a duty towards her which is to be attended to. One man’s dereliction of his duty toward me, will not authorize me to abandon my duty towards a third person, and thereby subject him to a loss. The rule, therefore, is well stated by the court below: the defendants should have looked out for danger in time, and guarded against it while it was possible to do so, and if they neglected to do so till it was too late to prevent the collision, they must be deemed to have been guilty of that want of due caution which every one, who navigates the canal, is bound to use to prevent the accidents to which a thronged navigation is liable.</p>
