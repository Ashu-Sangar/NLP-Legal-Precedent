On the 20thMarch, 1811, (see Stroud’s Purdon’s Dig., 6th ed. p. 680,)-an act was passed for the express purpose of settling the disputes which agitated the public mind in relation to these warrants. It is-there enacted, in the first section, that in all cases prior to that act, wherever the warrantee had made an agreement with a settler, previous to such settler going on to the land to settle it, and the settler had performed the duty, although after the time given for so doing by the act of 1792, the state would cease to have any claim, and would confirm the title. The act of the 19th March, 1816, (Stroud’s Purdon of 1841, p. 687,) reviving the act of the 20th March, 1811, above re-' ferred to, not only validates the title in all cases where the settlement has been made prior to its passage, but also declares, that all contracts that <em>shall be made </em>by the warrantee within two years from the 1st of April then next ensuing, with a settler for the purpose of making a settlement agreeably to the prior act, should be valid.</p>

The cases I have referred to fully establish this principle, that the entry of Phillis adversely on the land, <em>within the time given by law </em>to the warrantee for the making of his settlement, is itself a prevention and a legal excuse to the warrantee for not making the same; nor can Phillis, or his representatives, allege or avail themselves of the nonfulfilment of the condition of settlement by the original warrantee, when Phillis himself was the occasion of it. If he remained there and completed the settlement, it would inure for the benefit of the warrantee, whose title would thereby become perfect and complete. This is clearly decided in the cases of Ross <em>v. </em>Barker and Campbell <em>v. </em>Galbreath, before referred to; part of this latter case, it is true, has since been overruled, but not the principle in question, which is strictly in unison and harmony with the whole current of decisions on the subject.</p>

The vacating warrant in the name of Thomas Irvine was taken out on the 14th June, 1825, and the survey made in the following month; with regard to these, we say that they were utterly and entirely void. The Commonwealth had extended the time to the warrantee to make his' settlement until the 1st April, 1826, and therefore she could not enter for the breach of a condition which she had herself excused, nor could she confer that right on another. A vacating warrant does not per se invalidate the original one; the former is issued for any one who will procure the necessary affidavits for the land office; it is an ex parte proceeding altogether, in which the original warrantee is not heard, but it remains for subsequent decision by the courts, to judge of their respective validity.</p>

Was Irvine, who obtained the vacating <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>warrant for a settled and improved tract of land, an actual settler ? Or did Irvine, or any person claiming under him, ever enter on the land in question ? Under this much contested ninth section, I hold it to be the duty of the person who obtains a vacating warrant, or those claiming the benefit of the warrant, to enter upon the land and reside thereon, before the warrant would give him title. To enable the owner to do so, tire law contemplated that the vacating warrant should issue for vacant and unoccupied land, unless when a settler was in actual possession ; and then he was bound to continue the possession, to give efficacy and effect to the warrant. It could not issue, when the land was occupied adversely to the person obtaining the vacating warrant. The object of the vacating warrant was to place a settler on the land. Its views were prospective as to settlement. If it was not so, a false construction would be given to the act of the legislature, and a door opened to injustice, perjury, and fraud. When an ejectment was brought by a person owning the original warrant and survey, against an improver, it -would be the interest of the improver to loose the land, turn out, give his improvement to a relative, or his lawyer; who then obtains a vacating warrant, and lies by short of the period of twenty-one years, then brings an ejectment, and attaches the warrant to the' trespass and settlement, and recovers the land with all its improvements. This vacating warrant, according to the argument, is to heal all trespasses; a perfect panacea not contemplated by the act of 1792. That act allows the vacating warrant only, when the land was not improved. Possession must be continued, and taken in pursuance of a vacating warrant, to enable the owner to hold the tract. The plaintiffs further complain, that the Common Pleas instructed the jury, that Miller’s settlement on the land was presumed to be made under the warrant, until the contrary was shown. So has the law ever been held. The benign principle of justice is, that the possession is presumed to be in accordance with the title, and not in hostility to it.
