The 5th section, act of 5th April, 1790, does not include « county orders.” To bring them within it, they are set out in this indictment as bills of exchange. In the act, the term <em>“ </em>bill of exchange” has a definite technical meaning, and does not embrace every draft, order, or writing that resembles a bill. In sect. 37, act 15th April, 1834, (Purdon, 6th ed. 198,) these orders are called warrants, and are mere certificates of indebtedness.</p>

Warner, if not destroyed by him, and cannot therefore <em>be </em>more particularly set forth, of the value of $70 of the property of one George W. G. Judd.” On this indictment, Warner was tried and convicted, and sentenced to the Western Penitentiary. The stealing of dioses in action not being a felony at commonlaw, 4 Black. Com. 234; 2 East, P. C. 597; the first question presented was, whether county orders came within the provisions of the 5th section of the act of 5th April, 1790, which declares, “That the robbery or larceny of obligations, or bonds, bills, obligatory bills <a id="p156" href="#p156" data-label="156" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*156</a>of exchange, promissory notes for the payment of money, lottery tickets, paper bills of credit, certificates granted by or under the authority of this Commonwealth, or of all, or any of the United States of America, shall be punished in the same manner as robbery or larceny of any goods or chattels. As all penal laws are to be construed strictly, 1 Black. Com. 88; 4 Bac. Ab. 651, old ed.; 1 Wils. 164, it is the opinion of the court that county orders are not bills of exchange, nor do they come within matters designated in the act of 1790. Before a prisoner is convicted, it is the duty of the court to see that his offence'comes within the plain letter of the statute; especially where the crime is made a felony by legislative enactment.</p>
