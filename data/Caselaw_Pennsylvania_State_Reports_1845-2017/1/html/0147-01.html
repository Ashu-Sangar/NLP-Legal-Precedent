A venditioni exponas issued to May term, 1840, directed also to the sheriff of Lycoming, who, on the 13th of May, 1840, returned the property sold to Anson V. Parsons, for the sum of $145, which "was applied upon the judgment. This evidence ■was objected to by defendant’s counsel, because, 1. The judgment of 1824 was revived by sci. fa. against Taggart and Cartee, without any suggestion as to Jackson. 2. Because the revival of judgment by amicable sci. fa. in 1839 was without authority from John L. Cartee, and void as to him; and, 3. Because the revival of judgment by sci. fa. issued to the sheriff of Lycoming county, and served in Potter, and the levy and sale by the sheriff of Lycoming county of defendant’s property situate in Potter, were without authority of law, and void. The court overruled the 1st and 3d objections of defendant, and sustained the 2d, but admitted the evidence upon the ground that the judgment was valid against Taggart, and the sale would pass whatever interest Taggart might have in the property. Plaintiff then gave in evidence a deed from John Bennet, high-sheriff of Lycoming county, to Anson V. Parsons, for the land in controversy, dated 14th May, 1840, and an assignment of the sheriff’s deed on the back of it, from Anson V. Parsons to John King, the plaintiff, dated June 18,1840. Defendant gave no evidence. Plaintiff’s counsel then requested the court to charge the jury, that if they believed all the facts given in evidence in the cause, the plaintiff was entitled to recover. To this the court responded: “We answer in the negative, and say, the plaintiff is not entitled to recoverand in reply to points put by defendant’s counsel, say, 1st, That the judgment given in evidence is not a judgment against John L. Cartee, having been confessed by Bliss without authority from Car-tee ; and, 2d, That the plaintiff, having shown no title to the property in dispute in Leonard Taggart, he cannot recover, and the verdict of the jury must be for defendant.</p>

Potter county was erected out of Lycoming, and its boundaries established by act of 26th March, 1804, (4 Smith’s Laws, 171,) and by the 12thsection of that act, annexed to Lycoming for judicial purposes. By the act of 27th March, 1824, McKean county was provisionally organized, and Potter was annexed to McKean for’judicial purposes; act to take effect from and after the first day of September, 1826. Pamph. Laws, 1823-4, p. 104. This act contains no provision whatever for the removal to McKean county of judgments entered in Lycoming, previous to 1st of September, 1826, against residents of Potter and McKean, nor does it provide any mode by which the payment of such judgments may be enforced. The legislature could not, by this omission, deprive the plaintiffs in such judgments of their rights, and <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>of a remedy to enforce them, nor -would the courts adopt such a construction of the act as would destroy by implication what was not taken away by express enactment. Keating’s judgment was entered in 1824, before the act of 27th March, 1824, took effect. Its lien, consequently, remained, and the Court of Common Pleas of Lycoming county, not having been deprived of jurisdiction, quoad hoc, over the person and property of the defendants, was vested with all the authority which it ever possessed of enforcing, by its own process, directed to its own officer; and executed by him, the payment of the judgment. The position assumed, that thelien of the judgment remained, is fully sustained by the case of West's appeal, <a href="/watts/5/0087-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="5 Watts 87" data-case-ids="1843954" data-case-paths="/watts/5/0087-01">5 Watts, 87</a>; and that the court was not deprived of jurisdiction follows, as a necessary consequence, from the doctrine established by the court, in their opinion in that case. He referred also to the case of Stowe <em>v. </em>Gloniger, <a href="/serg-rawl/6/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="6 Serg. &amp; Rawle 63" data-case-ids="1805914" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/6/0063-01">6 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 63</a>.</p>
    <p id="b153-4" data-blocks='[["BL_153.4",153,[139,1069,1194,1351]]]'>■ But it is said that in the case of West’s appeal, testatum writs issued from the Common Pleas of Cumberland county, to the sheriff of Perry, to enforce the collection of the judgment. This is not by any means conclusive, that writs issued to the sheriff of Cumberland, and executed by him in the county of Perry, would have been irregular and void. The mode of enforcing the collection of the judgment was not made a question in that case. Had there been no law in existence authorizing the issuing of testatum writs, the only process that could have issued would have been writs directed to the sheriff of Cumberland. The existence of such a law could not affect the rights of the plaintiff, and would not deprive him of a remedy,'which he certainly would have had without its passage. The 24th section of the act of 22d May, 1722, re-enacted with additional provisions in the act of 16th June, 1836, sections 76 to 80 inclusive, extends the jurisdiction of the several courts of Common Pleas for the purposes mentioned therein, and makes the sheriff of the particular county to which the test. fi. fa. issues, the officer of the court from which it issues to execute and return it. These acts confer jurisdiction, but do not taire it away where it exists • and there is nothing in either act which would raise even a strong implication that in cases where the court is not deprived of jurisdiction over the subject-matter, it could not enforce its judgment by process directed to its own officer. See 8th and 9th sections of the act of 27th March, 1804. No other rational construction can be given to these sections than that the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas of Lycoming county is not divested in the case ,of judgments, and of suits pending, when one of the parties is not a resident of the county of McKean or Potter, and such is the construction given to a similar law by the Supreme Court.</p>

      <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>The case of Marges <em>v. </em>Oyster does not militate'against this doctrine. In that case the mortgage was recorded in Lycoming long after the division of Lycoming and Northumberland, and not having been recorded in Northumberland, was not a lien on the land lying in that county. A sale, therefore, upon a judgment obtained by sci. fa. on the mortgage in Lycoming, would vest no title in the purchaser to that portion of the mortgaged premises situated in Northumberland. So in the case of Treaster <em>v. </em>Leisher, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0137-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 137" data-case-ids="481788" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0137-01">7 Watts &amp; Serg. 137</a>, no proceedings were had upon tire mortgage previous to* the division of Centre from Mifflin. It was simply the case of a mortgage recorded.in Mifflin before the division, and sued in Mifflin after the division — the premises mortgaged lying in Centre. The mortgage could have been and ought to have been made in <em>Centre; </em>no jurisdiction having attached to the Court of Common Pleas of Mifflin, or having been reserved by the act creating the division. But if judgment had been obtained in Mifflin county previous to the passage of the act, what would have been the situation of the plaintiff? Could he not have issued his levari facias to the sheriff of Mifflin county after the division, and would not a sale by the sheriff of. Mifflin on such writ, have vested a title in the purchaser ? A levari facias could not have issued to the sheriff of Centre county; the judgment on tire sci. fa. or mortgage could not have been transferred, and the recovery in Mifflin would have been pleadable in bar to another sci. fa. issued in Centre.</p>

The record of the acknowledgment of the sheriff’s de'ed in Lycoming county would be legal notice if the court had jurisdiction, and no greater inconvenience would result from this doctrine than from the doctrine which preserves the lien of the judgment, or makes the acknowledgment of a sheriff’s deed, entered in Lycoming county notice for lands sold previous to the 1st of September, 1826. It is just as convenient to ascertain what judgments existed previous to the 1st of September, 1826, in Lycoming county, against residents of Potter, and what sales have been made and deeds acknowledged, since the annexation of Potter to McKean, as it is to ascertain what sales were made and deeds acknowledged previous to that time. And the defendant, Cartee, cannot complain of want of notice of the sale, as it was the duty of the sheriff to have given him notice of the time and place where the property was to be sold, and the presumption is he did so.</p>
