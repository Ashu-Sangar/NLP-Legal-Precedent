If the widow had died before Jacob Stoner, and before Abraham Boyer had parted with the land/ what claim would Jacob Stoner have had on Hie land, or on Abraham Boyer under and in pursuance of this deed and bond? By these writings, constituting their agreement, Boyer was bound to pay the interest of the one-third of the valuation to the widow during her life, and at her death was bound to pay to the other heirs their interest and proportion of that <em>fund; </em>of this there can be no question. But was he bound to pay Jacob Stoner any portion of it ?' Jacob Stoner could unquestionably have made his agreement so as to have compelled him to do so, and the question is, did he provide for the payment of his own portion or share at the death of the widow ? This question seems to be settled against the plaintiff in the case of Stecker <em>v. </em>Shimer, before referred to. In that case, which is very similar to the one now under consideration, John Stecker conveyed the land to Jacob Shimer, and <em>Shimer was to pay the interest of the sum charged, upon the land </em>
      <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>
      <em>annually to the widow during her </em>life, <em>and the principal sum to the other heirs at her death. </em>The deed provided that Shimer should <em>take and hold the land, subject to the payment of their shares to the children and the widow of the valuation money. </em>Mr. Justice Rogers, in delivering the opinion of the court in that case, observes, that <em>‘ on the face of the </em>proceedings in the Orphans’ Court, it is very clear that John Stecker had no lien on his own land for any portion of tire money payable at the death of the widow; as by the acceptance of the purpart and the decree of the court, he became the absolute owner in fee-simple of the premises. The lien, so far as it affects his share of the valuation money, was extinguished. And this would seem to have been the understanding of the original parties to the contract, for in the first deed from Stecker to Jacob Shimer, the reservation is made subject to the payment to the <em>other </em>children and' representatives of the deceased intestate, plainly excluding himself from any benefit to be derived from' any portion of the valuation money, which is made a lien on the premises. The word ‘other’ did not alter the construction. It would be a covenant to pay the portion of those children only whose shares were charged on the land, to the exclusion of the grantor.’ In the present case Jacob Stoner, by his deed;, conveys-the land absolutely to Abraham Boyer, warranting against all claims whatever, and in his bond of the same date he stipulates to indemnify Boyer against all claims to the land <em>‘ except the widow's third,' </em>and especially against all judgments and mortgages. The plaintiff relies on the words, &lt; <em>except the widow's third,' </em>to make out his claim to the money in dispute. That in this ’ exception Abraham Boyer in substance stipulated and agreed to pay to Jacob Stoner, or to his representatives at the death of the widow, his proportion of the money set apart for her use during her life. I cannot agree that such is the case. -The exception does not show that such was <em>the intention of the </em>parties. The words used in the bond are not so strong in support of this position contended for,- as the words used in the deed from Stecker to Shimer, to wit: ‘ subject to die payment to the children and representatives of the deceased intestate,’ to support the position that Shimer was to pay to Stecker, at the death of his mother, his proportion of the money charged on the land for his mother’s use. In the present case it is presumed that Boyer knew that by Jacob Stoner’s acceptance of the land at the appraisement in the Orphans’ Court, it was charged with one-third' of the valuation money, the interest of which was to be paid to the widow during her life, and at her death the children [other than Jacob] were entitled to their respective portions of that fund. ■ That nothing was to be paid to for he had no lien on the land, his share been extin<a id="p122" href="#p122" data-label="122" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*122</a>guished and paid by operation of law when he accepted the purpart at the appraisement, and that Boyer took the land only subject to the actual liens upon it, that is of the widow and heirs, excluding Jacob Stoner, for he had no lien on it. The deed and accompanying bond show that such was the understanding of the parties at the time; Jacob Stoner conveys all he could convey, the fee-simple in the land charged with the lien of the widow and other heirs. He could not convey it discharged of their lien, if he had felt disposed to do so. Abraham Boyer knew this, but there were judgments and mortgages to be provided against especially, and he required the indemnifying bond with security. These judgments and mortgages seem to have been the special object of the bond, for the words <em>except1 the widow’s third </em>are interlined. But giving these words their full place in the bond, I cannot regard them as constituting a covenant on the part of Boyer to pay more than was actually a lien on the land. These words were properly introduced in the bond for another purpose; they protect Stoner against his general warranty in his deed, and without them he would have been liable to Boyer for the amount Boyer would be compelled to pay the widow during her life, and. to the other heirs at her death. If then this question had arisen under the agreement between the parties after the. death of the widow, and before Boyer had parted with the land^ the plaintiff would not have been entitled to recover. If he could not recover, then it is difficult to see how his administrator can recover now.</p>

At what time this sale took place does not appear, nor is it material, if I am right in the position assumed, for Michael Killinger purchased subject to the actual liens on the land at the time, and if Jacob Stoner had no lien on it by his contract with Boyer, it is clear he had none at all, and therefore Killinger owes him nothing, even if he had notice at the sale of this bond of indemnity. I will here observe, that the only evidence we have that Killinger, or any of the subsequent purchasers, had any notice of this bond is, that it was found with the title paper.

The plaintiff proved by the deeds, under which the defendant claims title to the lands, that Abraham Boyer originally purchased the property charged with the payment of the third at the death of the widow of John Stoner; in fact, Jacob Clemens purchased the property subject to that charge, and thus made tire property responsible in his hands for the same.

The bond accompanied the title papers: the bond says, <em>except the widow’s third. </em>This is the <em>third </em>referred to, in the twenty-second section of the act of 1794, the <em>one-third </em>of the valuation money to be paid by the child taking the land, or his <em>assigns, </em>at the widow’s decease. Clemens, the owner of the land, was not ignorant of the import of the term <em>widow’s third. </em>An interpretation is put upon it in his deed, to wit, that he was to pay the widow annually the interest of f744, and at her decease to pay that sum to the heirs of John Stoner, deceased. Jacob was one of those heirs, and his part of the third was a debt <em>debiium in presentí, solvendum in futuro. </em>In Stecker <em>v. </em>Shimer, <a href="/whart/5/0452-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="5 Whart. 452" data-case-ids="8878581" data-case-paths="/whart/5/0452-01">5 Whart. 452</a>, there was no reservation whatever in the title papers, no notice to the purchaser.</p>

Riegel <em>vv </em>Sieger was the case of a judicial sale: we do not object to the doctrine there laid down. As the sheriff has no power to make any ■ reservation, he must of course sell the entire interest of the debtor. The case, however, of Fritz <em>v. </em>Heller, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20400" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 400">2 W. &amp; S. 400</a>, has in some degree shaken the case of Riegel <em>v. </em>Sieger, for it was the case of <em>&amp; judicial </em>sale; and yet this court required the purchaser to pay the entire amount due at the decease of the widow, including the share of the son who took the land at the valuation, and as whose land it was levied and sold.</p>

The title-papers here show distinctly a reservation of $744, as <em>so much of the purchase </em>money, which remained a charge upon the land. Clemens has paid but three-fourths of it; justice and equity require that he should pay the residue. Pidcock <em>v. </em>Bye and Fritz <em>v. </em>Heller pointedly sustain this position.</p>
