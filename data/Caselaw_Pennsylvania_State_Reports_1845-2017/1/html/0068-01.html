I found there John Men-gel, Henry Mengel, Francis Mengel, and Abraham Mengel. When we went in I produced the mortgage, which I had prepared before I started, and asked John Mengel to sign it, and the brothers objected, alleging that it would make their situation worse than it then stood, and said they had a judgment bond against their brother John to secure them as his bail. I told them I thought this would be a better security for them, for it would be for a good consideration, and that the consideration of their bond, I considered, as far as it respected Francis and Henry, was not good, as it was admitted then that they were both indebted to John Mengel. ' Francis Mengel had received of his brother John about fifty acres of land and a mill, and Henry Mengel was indebted to his brother John for land in Berks county." I don’t know how much he was indebted, or how much land he got. We talked to them a long time, Esquire Zell and myself, to induce them to permit John to sign the mortgage, and they would not agree to it. Esquire Zell and myself then came out of the house, the others following, and Esquire Zell'and I got on our horses to come away. I then told the Esquire to tell Abraham, I think it was, that suit should be brought against them the next day on the bonds which were due against John, Henry, and Francis. They finally agreed that John should sign the ■mortgage. They were all present in the yard, within hearing distance, when I told Esquire Zell to tell Abraham this. We went into the house again and John signed the mortgage, and there was a power of attorney drawn up, for Abraham to enter satisfaction on the judgment bond in Lancaster county. I drew it up there, on the bond given by John to Abraham, Henry and Francis. I did not know what amount Abraham had on the bond. Abraham told me that he would get John to •give him one of Henry’s bonds for what he owed him. Robert Jenkins and Caleb Jones were my co-guardians. Mr. Jenkins and myself were guardians for the younger children of John Evans, deceased, and Caleb Jones for Reese and David Evans. Mr. Jenkins "was not at John Mengel’s that day while I was there, nor was Caleb Jones <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>while I was there. It was at the instance of Mr. Caleb Jones that the sureties met there that day. There were no other persons present there that day in the room with us, than those I have named. I think the sureties asked that the bonds might be given up. I told them the bonds were all recited in the mortgage, and could not be given up. I mean the bonds given by John, Henry, and Francis Mengel to the executors of John Evans’s estate, which had been handed over to us as guardians. I think Caleb Jones had them first, and handed them pver to me. Mr. Jenkins never took an active part. They were the same bonds on a part of which the present suits are brought. I told them that the bonds could not be given up, that they were recited in the mortgage, and that it was taken as a further security for their payment. I told them their situation would be bettered by the mortgage, for that then, John’s property would have to be taken first, and that they would be accountable only for the balance, if there should be any. Caleb Jones knew that I had drawn the mortgage. It was agreed between us that I should meet the Mengel’s at John Mengel’s, to get the mortgage signed, and he would notify the bail. I never gave the bail the least intimation of a release. I never entered into any agreement with John, or the bail, or any of them, to release or discharge any of¡ them. I never gave John any time to pay the bonds. The time of payment was never extended. I was present at Flicker’s, in Reading, when suits on some of these bonds were tried before arbitrators. I think ■ it was in 1820. Abraham Mengel was examined there as a witness. He did not say that Caleb Jones was present at John Men-gel’s, when the mortgage was given. I have a copy of the notes of the testimony taken at that trial at Fricker’s, taken by Mr. Biddle. I got them not long alter the trial. Mr. Biddle gave them to me at my request. I remember that Abraham Mengel did not say on that trial, that Caleb Jones was present when the mortgage was taken; and on referring to these notes lately, I find that he did not say that Caleb Jones was present. There was not a word ever passed between Caleb Jones and me, as it regarded releasing the sureties in John Mengel’s bonds.”</p>

It is therefore incumbent on him to show, to your satisfaction, some legal or equitable reason; why he ought not to pay <a id="p76" href="#p76" data-label="76" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*76</a>the amount that is yet unpaid on the bonds. If he has failed to do this, then your verdict must be against him. His liability originally having been admitted, he must show a release or exoneration from that liability. His defence consists in an attempt to establish this, and whether he has been successful in this attempt is the matter now controverted.</p>

This decision was made on the evidence as given on that trial. If the evidence was the same now that it -was on that trial, there would be no fact for you to try, and we would not submit the question of release or exoneration of the defendant for your consideration. It appears to me that the testimony given now is very different, and much stronger than it was in the former trial, as far as I can gather it from the report of the case in this point. Mengel now testifies, that after Davies and the others came back, that they talked the matter all over, and gives as the conclusion of that conversation, that we, that is the sureties, agreed that John should sign the mortgage; that the sureties would give up their judgment, provided Davies would give up the bonds. He says this was finally agreed by the sureties. He also testifies that Davies did not say that he would give up the bonds, but that he did say that it made no difference whether he did or not; that it made no difference about them. If Davies did say, when he was asked to give up the bonds, that it made no difference whether he did or not, what would the sureties understand by that expression ? How can the defendant have the benefit of the assurance that Davies gave him, that it made no difference whether the bonds were given up or not ? In no other way, than by treating the bonds as given up, so far as regards him. It made no difference whether the bonds were given up or not, <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>if the defendant was not called upon, or held liable to pay any money upon them; but it would make a very great difference to him, if he was still held liable to pay the money. This very difference is what the defendant wished to obviate, by having the bonds given up; to treat the sureties as if the bonds were given up, is the only way to malee good to them Davies’s assertion, that it made no difference whether they were given up or not. What else could Davies mean by this expression ? It is not necessary, to exonerate sureties, that the word release, or exonerate, should be used. Any words which show that to have been the intention of the parties, will be sufficient for that purpose. This intent is to be determined from what the parties mutually <em>agreed upon. What </em>then did the parties say, and agree upon, and do at the time ? In determining upon their intention, you will adopt the plain, ordinary, common sense meaning of the terms employed by them in making their agreement. It is for you to say what the agreement was. If you believe that Davies said, when urged to give up the bonds, that it made ho difference whether he gave up the bonds or not, and that relying on this, John signed the mortgage, and the sureties entered satisfaction on their judgment, it would tend to prove that Davies had exonerated the sureties, and would be evidence from which you might infer that he had exonerated them. Henry had a judgment against John to indemnify him against this liability. This judgment, with the consent of his co-plaintiffs, he might have used at any time. He would have had a right to have the land sold, and the money raised to have paid the debt, for which he was liable. He would have had a right to have superintended the sale, so far as to have prevented the sacrifice of the land. These were rights which were valuable to him, and part of them he gave up when he entered satisfaction on his judgment. This was done by him in pursuance of this agreement.</p>

To conclude: If you believe that Davies said, at the time the agreement was made, as testified to by Mengel, that the land was always good for the money; that it was that which he wanted for security; that it made no difference whether he gave up the bonds o'r not; that it made no difference about the bonds, and that relying upon this, John signed the mortgage, and the sureties caused their judgment to be satisfied: this would be evidence from which you might infer that Davies had exonerated the defendant.

Under that plea, which is in the nature of a bill in equity, the defendant insists he is entitled to relief, because, as he contends, on the 17th day of June, 1816, in consideration that John Mengel would execute a mortgage of that date, the guardians of the minor children of John Evans (to whom, the land had been assigned) released or discharged the obligors. On the defendant is thrown the burden of proving the issue, and if he has shown that the guardians agreed to exonerate the obligors for the consideration stated, it is undoubtedly a discharge in equity from all liability on his part : whether he has succeeded is the only point in issue. The other points which were raised on the trial are subsidiary to this question. The same case was before this court on a former occasion, and reported in <a href="/watts/6/0072-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts 72" data-case-ids="1846125" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0072-01">6 Watts, 72</a>. We were then of opinion, that there was no evidence given, tending to show that the guardians, or any of them, had agreed to give up the bonds, or to exonerate the sureties. For this reason, we reversed the judgment, and ordered the cause to be remanded for a new trial. It now comes before us again on the testimony of the same witnesses, and, in our opinion, with no substantial variation in the evidence. The defendant’s case depends solely on the testimony of one witness, Abraham <em>Mengel; </em>for unless he proves a contract, the defence altogether fails. For it must be conceded, that Edward Davies, a witness examined on the part of the plaintiff, and who, it is alleged, made the agreement, expressly swears, that he told Mengel and the sureties, in answer to their proposition to that effect, that he could not release them from the payment of the bonds. The question therefore is, whether, admitting the truth of Mengel’s testimony, and all the inferences that can be legitimately drawn from it, the defendant has any defence; or, in other words, is it in proof from this, or any other <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>source, that there was a binding contract between the parties, that the payment of the bonds should not be enforced. That the bonds were delivered up, or that there was an express agreement to surrender them, will not be pretended. The testimony is, that the obligors, and particularly the sureties, as a consideration for the execution of the mortgage, were very desirous that they should be surrendered; but Mr. Davies, who was the acting guardian,- constantly and steadily, refused to accede to their request, and for reasons perfectly satisfactory, and which he assigned at the time. After negotiating for some time without coming to any result, Davies left the house with a determination, which was communicated to the obligors, of commencing suit immediately on the bonds. It was not until then, that the sureties consented, that John, who was the principal, should execute the mortgage, and the inference from the whole case - is irresistible, that it was the fear of this consequence, and not any promise to relinquish any other remedy in their hands, that induced them to come into his terms. Such was the opinion of this court, when the case was before us on a former occasion, and we see nothing now to induce us to change or vary it, in the slightest degree. And this would seem to be the impression of the learned judge, before whom the cause was last tried. He puts the case, as I understand him, upon what he considers a new and distinct ground, the disclosure of evidence which did not exist on the former trial. I allude to the expressions used by Davies, after his return to the house, and about the time of the conclusion of the arrangement. Mr. Davies then said, that it made no difference whether he gave up the bonds or not; that the land was worth the money. If the jury believe, say the court, that Davies said, when urged to give up the bonds, that it made no difference whether he gave up the bonds or not, and that relying on this, John signed the mortgage, and the sureties entered satisfaction on their judgment, it would tend to prove, that Davies exonerated the sureties, and would be evidence from which the jury might infer that he had exonerated them. From this instruction we entirely dissent. How these expressions, however understood by the parties to whom they were addressed, can prove an agreement to deliver up or release the obligors, in the face of an express refusal to come into any such arrangement, we find some difficulty to understand. We must take the whole transaction together, and give words their obvious import, and from these .it is impossible to say, that Mr. Davies gave the obligors any assurance, or entered into any engagement, as the court more than intimate to the jury, that he would not resort, if necessary, to suit on the bonds, to enforce the payment of the debt due. What does it amount to, but the expression of an opinion, <a id="p84" href="#p84" data-label="84" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*84</a>(we are bound to believe honestly entertained,) that it was of little consequence whether the bonds were given up or not; that the land about to be mortgaged was worth as much, or more than the debt due. But of this the obligors were as competent to judge as he was, and supposing it to be a mutual mistake, it can furnish no defence legal or equitable to the defendant. If it had been a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of Mr. Davies, they would have a right to complain j but granting it to be the mistake of both, neither can derive any advantage from it. It is very probable Mr. Davies was at the time under that impression, and so said, as an inducement to give the mortgage; but in this we see nothing wrong: indeed, it is very probable, that no loss would have arisen to either party, if the land had not unfortunately depreciated very much in value. This is the unforeseen cause of the whole difficulty, and no doubt has given rise to this controversy. The question does not depend upon what the obligors may have thought of it at the time, for of this we cannot judge, as we cannot dive into the recesses of their <em>hearts; </em>our attention must be directed solely to the contract of the parties; It is very certain, that they had no right to think that Mr. Davies intended to release them, when he told them in words which it was difficult to misunderstand, that such was not his intention. If they actually imbibed that impression, which it is difficult to believe, it is not the fault of Mr. <em>Davies; </em>the loss, if any, arises from their own folly. Fraud has not been imputed to the guardian, nor can it be, with the least colour of reason. View the transaction as it is presented by the evidence, and it amounts to this: Mr. Davies, acting for minors, was desirous of procuring real security for a debt justly due. This the defendants were unwilling to give, unless on terms which the guardian conceived' to be inadmissible. In the course of a protracted negotiation, Mr. Davies used such arguments as he supposed would bring about the desired arrangement, and, amongst others, made light of a demand, which the other deemed of great importance, suggesting, and very likely believing, that the land proposed to be mortgaged, was worth the money due. Finding, however, these arguments ineffectual, he threatens to commence suit, and, finally, it is agreed to execute the mortgage, without conditions. In the course of his testimony, Mengel, after giving an account of the attempt at an arrangement, says: “At length, Davis, Jones, and Zell, went off. Zell returned back, told me to tell John, if he did not sign the mortgage, he would sue the bonds. We consulted awhile, and they were called back, talked the matter over; finally, we agreed John would sign the mortgage, provided judgment and bonds were given up, something to that amount. We were to give up our judgment against John.” The <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>counsel contend, that when he says, “we agreed John would sign, provided judgment and bonds were given uphe meant to include Mr. Davies, asserting, that all agreed to this arrangement. We do not think the words will admit of this construction, and such was the opinion of Judge Banks, who understood the witness as referring to the ■ obligors only, and not to Mr. Davies. And this is rendered certain by another part of the' testimony, for on his cross-examination, he distinctly admits, that Davies did not say, he would give up the bonds; “ said it made no difference whether he did or not; that it made no difference about the bonds.” It then appears uniformly, whenever Davies is pressed to accede to their terms, he evades doing so, expressing an opinion, that it was useless to insist upon it, that it was not of the importance they seemed disposed to attach to it. On the whole testimony, we are of the opinion, that no case has been proved in which a Chancellor would relieve the defendant, as there is no evidence which even tends to prove any contract whatever to release, or in any way discharge the obligors. To cut a party loose from his contract on such evidence, would be a most dangerous precedent, as it is without precedent in a court of equity.</p>
