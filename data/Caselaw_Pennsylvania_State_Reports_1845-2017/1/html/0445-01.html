Mrs. Kennedy first came to me to buy a wagon, harness, and whiffletrees, amounting to $94. She got my terms, and said there was to be a trade between us (herself and husband, Isaac Kennedy) and Ware, as to the judgment Ware had against me. She said they were to get the judgment. Isaac Kennedy came afterwards for the property, and got it. He said, if I would give -him the wagon, harness, and whiffletrees, he would satisfy so much on this judgment. He got the property, and agreed that when the judgment should be assigned to him by Ware, that he would endorse the same on this judgment. Soon after this, he told me that the trade was likely to fall through, and I told him he must pay Ware for the property he had of me. • After this, saw him again, and he said the trade was going on. Afterwards, saw him again, and he said he had got from Ware the assignment of the judgment against me, and would endorse the amount of the property he got of me on it, and he gave me a receipt to that effect. At this time, he said he was to pay Ware for the assignment in land, and that he, Ware, was to have the Farnham and Lull lot for it. He told me so again, in 1838 ; I think, in the fall. It appears to me that it was one hundred acres of land. I have understood that there is one hundred acres in the Farnham and Lull lot. I know the land; it is situated in Wayne township. Plaintiff’s wife, Polly Esther, is a daughter of Isaac Kennedy. Isaac Kennedy died in the spring of 1840. I went to Isaac Kennedy, to settle some difficulties. I, at that time, asked him what he was agoing to do as to making Ware a title to the land. He said that Ware was to have the land. The Farnham and Lull tract is the same that in Isaac Kennedy’s will is willed to Wm. Campbell, another son-in-law.” (Cross-examined.) <em>“ </em>I gaye the $409 for the balance due on my land to Charles H. Kennedy. I have a writing that I was to have the land for <em>$500. The </em>land then came into Charles’ hand, and my wife and I signed a quit claim for the $500 due me. The land was Isaac Kennedy’s first, which he sold to me. I gave the $909 and some cents for the land. Charles was bound in the bond to give each of the <em>girls $500. </em>Isaac said the rest of the girls had had $500, and Ware’s was entitled to the same. The $409 was part of the $500 that Kennedy was to give to his daughter. He spoke of owing the same to Ware.”</p>

I have frequently heard the old man say this.” (Cross-examined.) “ Isaac Kennedy said Ware was to have $500, or the land. He was speaking of making a disposition among his children.” (Further direct.) “I understood from Mrs. Kennedy, that they had settled every thing but this land.

      <em>Barnes Gb'eely </em>testified as follows : “I heard Ware say that he took this bond from Charles for what he (Charles) was to pay him for Isaac Kennedy. That Charles was bound to pay the $500, and did do it. Ware said, he (Charles) had made an agreement with Isaac Kennedy, by which he was to pay Ware $500, as his wife’s portion. Ware, about the time of the assignment back to Isaac Kennedy of this judgment by Ware, said to the oíd man, ‘ There has been a considerable noise about this, and if you consider it-yours, I will give it back to you. If you consider it yours, now take it; but if it is mine, I want it, and no noise about it, if I spend it to-morrow.’ Ware said, the old man and Madison reprimanded him for making the offer, saying, that the rest of the children or girls had theirs, and this was his. He said he did transfer it, but that he was to'have therefor the Farnham and Lull lot. Ware told me that he had once looked at the land, and did not want it. I will not be positive that this was after the transfer of the judgment. I know the Lull and Farnham lot; the Lewis lot and Draper lot' — know all. I do not know what improvements were then made.” (Cross-examined.) “ My impression is, that when Ware said he had looked at Lull and Farnham land, it was before the trade, whilst they were bargaining about it. Ware was to give Kennedy the bond and a yoke of oxen, and Kennedy was to give him something <a id="p448" href="#p448" data-label="448" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*448</a>back, but can’t say how much.

Lit. 232 b, note 1) to be a declaration of trust with an agreement to permit the assignee to sue in the assignor’s name. The contract being consequently executory, must have a consideration to <em>support </em>it, without which equity would no more execute it than the law would make the breach of it a subject of compensation. It was indeed said, in Carteret <em>v. </em>Paschall, 3 P. Williams, 199, that a parol contract might be good without consideration, though not tó bar a wife’s right of survivorship by the assignment of her chose in action. But' the law is decidedly settled otherwise by Robinson <em>v. </em>Vavasor, Vin. Abr. tit. <em>Assignment, </em>D., case 29; Crouch <em>v. </em>Martin, 2 Vern. 595; Suffolk <em>v. </em>Greenville, 3 Chan. Rep. 90; Whitehill <em>v. </em>Wilson, 3 Penna. Rep. 413; and a dictum of Lord Keeper Bridgeman, 2 Freem. 145. What is the proper consideration ? Consanguinity is sufficient to raise a use ; but that it is not a consideration for an assignment like the. present, is shown by Bret <em>v. </em>J. S. and wife, Cro. Eliz. 755, where it was held that natural affection is not a sufficient consideration for an assumpsit <a id="p451" href="#p451" data-label="451" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*451</a>to ground an action. Harford v. Gardener, 2 Leon. 30; Best v. Jolly, 1 Sid. 38, and Butcher v. Andrews, Carth. 446, are to the same effect. It was indeed said by Lord Mansfield and Mr. Justice Buller, in Hawkes v. Sanders, Cowp. 289, and repeated by Lord Mansfield in Freeman v. Fenton, Cowp. 544, “that a legal or equitable duty is a sufficient consideration for an actual promise; that when a man is under a moral obligation which no court of law or equity can enforce, and he promises, the honesty and rectitude of the thing is a consideration:” And it maybe said that a man is morally bound to nourish and provide for his own children. - .But it is shown by a masterly review of all the cases in a note to Wennall v. Adley, 3 Bos. &amp; Pull. 249, that Lord Mansfield’s principle was intended for cases in which the promisor has received an actual benefit, but is protected from liability for it by some statute or stubborn rule of law. All the cases put by him for the sake of illustration are certainly of that stamp. “Indeed Lord Mansfield appears,” adds the annotator, “ to have used the term moral obligation, not as expressive of any vague or undefined claim arising from nearness of relationship, but of those imperative duties which would be enforceable at law were it not for some positive rule which, with a view to general benefit, exempts the party in that particular instance from legal liability.” And this restriction of the principle which reconciles it to the older authorities, is sanctioned by Mills v. Wyman, <a href="/mass/20/0207-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Pick. 207" data-case-ids="2010271" data-case-paths="/mass/20/0207-01">3 Pick. 207</a>, in which the court refused to enforce a written promise to pay a son’s expenses incurred when sick among strangers. I am aware that the principle was ruled differently by this court in Wentz v. Dehaven, <a href="/serg-rawl/1/0312-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="1 Serg. &amp; Rawle 312" data-case-ids="1796742" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/1/0312-01">1 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 312</a>, where a parol relinquishment of a mortgage debt, in favour of a child, was held good without consideration, because, though unsealed, it was written: a reason that was rejected in Whitehill v. Wilson already quoted, but in which my own suggestion of a reason for the-decision, that the relinquishment was for natural love and affection, was no better. Wentz v. Dehaven is not to be sustained on any ground. Every man is indeed under a moral obligation to maintain and provide for his offspring; but it is an obligation which springs from .the dictates of his nature; not from a benefit received from the parent, or a prejudice suffered by the child.
