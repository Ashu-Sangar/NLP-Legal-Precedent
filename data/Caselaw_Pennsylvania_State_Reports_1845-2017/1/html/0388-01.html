The oath, too, was well administered by an alderman in Pittsburgh, though' the award was in another county; for the alderman had a general power; and it is indifferent, not only in point of substance, what were the territorial limits of his jurisdiction, but it is absolutely necessary, in point of convenience, that a sick or infirm suitor be not compelled to travel, perhaps, from Philadelphia to the shore of Lake Erie to find a competent magistrate.</p>

What though the appellant directed the prothonotary to detain the money till his right to appeal should be determined ? He parted with the control of it when he parted with the possession of it, and the direction was simply void.
