      <em>Opinion. </em>— « Whether the will given in evidence, executed as it was during the coverture of Eliza Lyne, late Eliza Jones, is of any validity, must depend altogether upon the construction of the deed of Eliza Jones to Christian Stahl, executed and duly rendered on the 8th April, 1825, when she was a single woman, and had full power to grant and convey the property on such terms as she thought proper. By this deed she conveys the property in dispute to Christian Stahl, £ in trust for the sole and separate uses and benefits of herself and her heirs and assigns for ever, but in such a way, and manner that if at any future period the said Eliza Jones should intermarry with any person or persons, her husband or husbands shall by no usage or custom whatever have any right, title, or claim or interest to the rents, issues, and profits of the premises. Nor shall the said premises, nor the rents, issues and profits thereof, be in any way or manner liable for any debts which he or they may now owe, or which he or they may hereafter contract, but be subject to her own order alone, any thing hereinafter contained to the contrary notwithstanding.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b116-7" data-blocks='[["BL_116.7",116,[331,1650,1176,573]]]'>“ In other wrords, did Eliza Jones, afterward Eliza Lyne, reserve to herself the power in the above deed to convey the property by a will that she might hereafter make during her coverture ? I take it that it is not material to this question that she devised the property to her heirs at law, in accordance with the deed of trust. If she has reserved the power to dispose of the property by will, she could have devised it to a stranger. One act of Assembly relating to wills, passed 8th April, 1833, authorizes a married woman,£ under a power legally created for the purpose,’ to dispose of her real and personal estate. It cannot be denied that Eliza Jones, when she executed this will, being then unmarried, could have reserved to herself the power to dispose of the property by will during coverture ; the question is, did she do so ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b116-8" data-blocks='[["BL_116.8",116,[333,2227,1170,189]],["BL_117.1",117,[153,380,1203,808]]]'>“Tn Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, 1 Rawle, it is laid down as the rule that a married woman has no power but what is expressly given. In the case of Thomas <em>v. </em>Folwell, 2 Wharton, this rule is recognised as the settled law in Pennsylvania: £ That a married woman is to be deemed <a id="p115" href="#p115" data-label="115" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*115</a>to possess no power in respect to her separate estate but what is positively given or reserved for her by the instrument creating such estate.’ Several other decisions recognise this doctrine, of a later date. So that whatever may be the law in other states, or in England, we must take the rule here indicated with so much conformity as the law of this state: besides, this rule has the merit of substantial justice to support it. In the case of Thomas <em>v. </em>Folwell, the real estate was^ granted by Allen and his wife to the trustee, his heirs and assigns, in fee-simple, to have and hold the same unto the trustee, his heirs and assigns for ever, in trust to and for the only proper use of the wife, her heirs and assigns for ever. The trustee to receive the rents, issues and profits, and pay them over to the wife, or to such person and in such manner as she shall or may direct, order, or appoint from time to time, and at all times hereafter. During the coverture, Mrs. Allen made her will, devising the property to her husband. The court held that she had no power to make a will and dispose of the property during coverture.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b117-3" data-blocks='[["BL_117.4",117,[154,1203,1182,190]]]'>“ Was, then, Eliza Lyne, late Jones, authorized during her coverture, to make a will under a power legally created for the purpose, in the words of an act of Assembly, which is in effect the same as the rule laid down by the Supreme Court ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b117-4" data-blocks='[["BL_117.5",117,[151,1398,1199,806]]]'>“ In the deed to Christian Stahl she conveys the property in trust for her own separate and sole benefit, and that of her heirs and assigns for ever. This deed conveys the whole estate, the rents, issues and profits to herself during life, and the remainder to her heirs and assigns for ever; and provides ‘ that no future husband shall have any claims or interest to the rents, issues, and profits of the premises. Nor shall the said premises, nor the rents, issues and profits thereof, be in any ■way liable for any debts which he may owe or hereafter contract, but be subject to her order alone.’ These provisions in this deed places the parties, as nearly as may be, in the same condition as was the wife placed in the case of Thomas <em>v. </em>Folwell; here the rents, issues and profits of the premises are to be received by the trustee, and paid over to Eliza Jones without interruption by any act of a husband that she might have, and subject to her order alone. In that case they were to be paid to Mrs. Allen, the wife, or to such person and in such manner as she shall or may direct, order, and appoint, from time to time, and at • all times hereafter.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b118-4" data-blocks='[["BL_118.4",118,[330,578,1181,1104]]]'>“ Taking the whole sentence together, as well as the whole deed, I come to a different conclusion. Mrs. Lyne, late Jones, evidently contemplated marriage, and, to secure her property to her own separate use, and to her children after her death, makes the deed already referred to, and conveys the whole in fee-simple, in trust for her sole and separate use during her life, whether married or single, and intending to control the property during her life, for further caution provides against the husband, or his creditors during her life, having any control over the premises, or the rents, issues, and profits. This deed, like the case in Thomas <em>v. </em>Folwell, conveys in fee-simple to the trustee. Nor is there reserved to Mrs. Lyne stronger language of intention to convey it by will in this case than in that. In that case the rents, &amp;c. were to be paid to the wife, or to such person and in such manner as she shall from time to time, and at all times hereafter, order and direct. In this case the counsel seems to think that there is force in the words — ‘ In trust for herself, her heirs and assigns,’ which shows that her intention was to reserve the liberty of disposing of her property by will during coverture or otherwise. On a reference to the case of West <em>v. </em>West, in 10 Serg. &amp; Rawle, it will be seen that the word ‘assigns’ makes no difference. In view, then, of the act of Assembly, and the settled law in Pennsylvania, I am of the opinion Eliza Lyne had no authority to make the will given in evidence, and accordingly give judgment for the plaintiffs.”</p>
