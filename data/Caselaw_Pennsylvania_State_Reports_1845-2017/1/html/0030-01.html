In view of this state of facts, was it incumbent upon the plaintiff to tender a deed for the land? Was he not relieved from <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>doing this by the conduct of Baney and Kurtz ? These acts of theirs might disarm him, and induce him to make a second sale. If they did lead to that result, or had a direct tendency to lead to it, can they now complain that a deed was not tendered ? When the plaintiff had been informed by both, that they would not- take the land, to what good purpose would a deed have been tendered. If their conduct amounted to a determination on their part, not to taire the land, and of this had given notice to the plaintiff, it would then be unnecessary for the plaintiff to tender them a deed. Nor was he bound to wait longer, and perhaps lose an opportunity of making an advantageous sale to another. If they had changed their minds, and had been willing to take the land and comply with the contract, they should have given timely notice of this change of purpose to the plaintiff. A. man may waive the performance of any thing which is to be done for his benefit.

At law, therefore, plaintiff was entitled to recover, and the defendants have not shown any defence legal or equitable. After this refusal to comply and notice, it was not necessary for plaintiff to wait until afterthe 1st of April, 1842, before he sold again. So far from this, as the agreement with Deppen of 22d February, 1842, shows that land had depreciated $4 per acre, it was the duty of Killmer to sell as soon as he could, and this is particularly insisted upon and held by his honour, the chief justice, in the case cited from 2 Penna. Rep., and in that case, as well as in the case cited from 13 Johns., it is said that the necessities of plaintiff might require an immediate sale. And why should plaintiff have waited ? If defendants be not bound by bill in suit, neither would plaintiff be bound; and if plaintiff had waited until after 1st April, 1842, and property had depreciated f 10 per acre instead of $4, it would have been a manifest loss to defendants. But both parties were bound by the bill, and if plaintiff had waited and tendered a deed and sued on articles, the defendant could have held him to the amount of stipulated damages, and he could have recovered no more.</p>

But it has been contended that the agreement with the Deppens was merely executory, and notwithstanding that agreement, if Kurtz and Baney had tendered the purchase money agreed to be paid by them on the 1st April, 1842, and a deed to be executed by Killmer, he could have conveyed to them a good title, because the agreement to sell to Kurtz and Baney was prior to that to sell to the Deppens.

Were the plaintiff before the court in the attitude of a vendor seeking specific execution, his conduct would certainly bar him. As was said in Ley <em>v. </em>Huber, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20368" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Watts 368">3 Watts, 368</a>, a chancellor is deaf to one who was not the owner at the time of the bargain: much less would he attempt to execute a contract which the complainant has rendered impracticable. But here the plaintiff stands on a legal title; and what is there in the case to impair it ? It has been suggested that as the vendees were not bound to elect between an-execution of the. contract or payment of stipulated damages, before the day fixed for the conveyance, they were at liberty to revoke their election in the mean time; and that the vendor was consequently bound to retain the title, in order to be ready for the event. But was he bound to retain it while the market was falling ? He was certain that the vendees would not make their election unless the market should take a turn; and to require him to be ready, at the hazard of losing without a chance of gaining, would be palpably unjust. Had the land risen in value, the vendees would doubtless have taken it at the stipulated <em>price; </em>but had it fallen, they would as certainly have rejected it.. After-they had deliberately given the bargain up, the vendor was bound by no duty, legal or moral, to bide their time. As no day was fixed for the declaration of their election, they might declare it at any time; and an election once made is irrevocable. (1 Rol. 726, 1. 15.) But there was no proposal to rescind, and consequently no acceptance of one. What was the contract ? The plaintiff agreed, by articles in the ordinary form, to sell his farm to the defendants, and convey the title at a particular day; while they, on the other' hand, executed the sealed paper on which suit is brought, and by which they promised to pay him five hundred dollars at the day, as part of the purchase money, but with this peculiar qualification: <em>“ </em>Should we, however, not comply with the condition of said purchase, then the said sum shall be the assessed and liquidated damages due said Killmer for our non-performance, and shall be collected as other debts of similar amount.” When, therefore, they announced their determination to throw the farm on the vendor’s hands, and gave him notice to govern himself accordingly, they did not propose to rescind, but expressed a determination to act <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>in a particular way on the basis of the contract itself. They had reserved a right to reject the land on payment of a specific sum; and it would be a strained construction to hold an election of the alternative to be an offer to undo the whole contract, and the vendors consequent resale of the land to be an acceptance of it. He had a right to understand the notice to be an act of election on the terms of the contract, which he had no power to resist;. and all that remained was to do the best he could with the land, for his own interest.</p>
