The record shows that the child lived with her mother. Having property in her own right, she had a guardian who paid her mother for her boarding. It is contended that, as the infant had a guardian, he ought to have brought the action for the penalty, and that the guardian only could sustain the action for the penalty. The surviving mother is a parent within the statute. The defendant became subject to the penalty, unless he had first produced to him <em>“ </em>a certificate of the consent of the parent or parents, guardian or guardians, master or mistress of the minor.

Either could maintain it. The mother was no doubt most grieved. She lost the fellowship, care, and education of her offspring. The action was well brought by the mother for the injury inflicted by the defendant. Cases under this act have been often before me. It is no penalty where the minor is rich, and I have often thought that it would be wise in the legislature to add imprisonment to the penalty. Ministers and justices of the peace would not go to prison for a marriage fee. Until that is done, the mischief will never be stopped.</p>
