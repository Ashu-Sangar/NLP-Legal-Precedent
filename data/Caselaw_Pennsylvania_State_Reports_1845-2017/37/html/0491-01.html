A. Wooley, who had become the purchaser of the property at sheriff’s sale, confessed a judgment January 31st 1857, to be released on the payment of the balance of the purchase-money due on an article of agreement between Baltzell and Roberts for the property, six months from date, “ amount to be ascertained by prothonotary.” He then offered a paper marked filed, which purported to be the calculation of the prothonotary for the balance due on the above-mentioned article of agreement; in which was included the three judgments against Baltzell, or so much thereof as had been assigned to Roberts.' This evidence was objected to on the ground that the calculation was made after Roberts’s interest in the house and lot had been divested by the sheriff’s sale, and that there was no authority from Lewis to make this appropriation of the judgments assigned to him, so as to affect the interest of Myers, the attaching creditor; but the court below overruled the objection, and admitted the evidence. The garnishee having closed, the plaintiff offered in evidence the sheriff’s deed to Worley above mentioned, dated March 28th 1856, to show that at the time the calculation was made by the prothonotary, Roberts had no .interest in the property, and that no one had authority to make the appropriation. This offer was objected to by the garnishee, but the court overruled the objection and admitted the evidence.</p>

That there is no evidence in the case that Lewis Roberts either authorized or directed that the judgments given in evidence by the plaintiff, should be applied to the extinguishment of the purchase-money; that the calculation of the prothonotary including ‘these judgments of the balance of the purchase-money does not extinguish them, nor prevent the plaintiff from attaching them.</p>

    <p id="b493-11" data-blocks='[["BL_493.13",493,[172,1515,1163,601]]]'>Here, very evidently, Baltzell not only had a claim which he might in some form set up as an extinguishment of the judgments of Roberts against him; but those judgments had in fact been extinguished two years before the attachment by being set off in another suit by Baltzell <em>v. </em>Roberts and others. The judgment in that case is conclusive of the right when we find the fact to be so; for we cannot, in this collateral proceeding, inquire into the nature of the confession or other evidence on which the judgment was founded. Roberts was a party to that suit, and the judgment of the court was that Baltzell should recover the amount due him, after deducting the amount of these judgments of Roberts against him. After that we inquire no further; the judgments are extinguished. Roberts could no longer enforce them, and his attaching creditor is no better off.</p>
