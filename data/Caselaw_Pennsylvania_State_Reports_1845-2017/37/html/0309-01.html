The existence of a contract was a question for the jury. If they found it proven, and a breach, the plaintiff was entitled to recover.</p>

The abuses growing out of a mistaken rule of damages in similar cases, have been corrected by recent decisions, which, however, did not pretend to affect the settled law of the land, that actions on such parol contracts could be sustained. Upon this point, the action of the legislature is sufficient to indicate that the-people have not thought proper to require that such contracts shall be in writing, and signed by the party to be charged therewith, or some other person thereto by him lawfully <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>authorized <em>by </em>writing, agreeably to the provisions of the English statute of frauds.</p>
