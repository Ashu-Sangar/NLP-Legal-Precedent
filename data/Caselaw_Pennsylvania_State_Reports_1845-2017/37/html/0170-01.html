      <em>“ </em>The fact of the articles being marked with the plaintiff’s name and place of residence, affords <em>primd facie </em>evidence of ownership in him sufficiently to entitle him to sustain his action, if, in all other respects, his right to recover be made out. This, he contends, has been done. The furniture has never been forwarded to him, and for this omission of duty he claims to recover its value. <em>The defence is, that navigation having closed in the canal before the furniture came into defendants' possession, excused them till it reopened the following spring from sending it on, and that, in the mean time, a new contract or agreem.ent was made by the parties by which the plaintiff was to take it at Erie, and thus exonerate them from sending it forward. </em>' <em>If the first fact existed, it affords a sufficient excuse for the time being. </em>How was it as to the second alleged one ? — The evidence is furnished, in the main, <a id="p173" href="#p173" data-label="173" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*173</a>by the letters of the plaintiff and the testimony of Hearn and Knapp. The furniture reached Erie the last of November ; on the 9th of December the plaintiff writes to the defendants, saying, he had heard, through Mr. Reynolds, of its arrival there in a damaged condition, and directs them what to do in the way of adjusting the damages, and for them to advise him of the result as early as they conveniently could. No reply was made; but <em>the evidence in defence is, that the defendants compromised the damages with the agent of the American Transportation Company at less than one-fourth of what the injury to the furniture is proven to have sustained. </em>At what time the compromise was made, whether before or after the receipt by the defendants of the plaintiff’s letter, or whether the amount received by them, in pursuance thereof, was greater or less than the cost of transportation, nowhere appears. Nothing more is said or heard of the matter till the 23d of April following, when the plaintiff requested Knapp, who was running a boat on the canal, to call on the defendants and get the furniture. This Knapp says he did about the 25th of that month, but the defendants declined giving it to him until the expenses were paid; but gave no bill or amount of them. This, they say, excused them from forwarding the goods, and justified them in holding on to them till the expenses were paid them. If they were in the business designated, they were bound to forward the goods without any unreasonable delay, and if the plaintiff requested another person to call and get them, they could not be required to give them up unless their reasonable charges and expenses were paid; but, as previously stated, they did not say what they were, or whether the money received by them for the damages was or was not sufficient to cover them. The two letters of December and April did not make a contract excusing the defendants from forwarding the goods, as they do not appear to have replied to them, or done any act indicative of compliance with the request made, unless it be in the compromise of the damage-money, as above mentioned, and the refusal to Knapp to let him take the goods. <em>How, too, could the plaintiff, sending for the goods hy Knapp, excuse the defendants’ forwarding them on to Meadville hy their own boats, after they had refused to give them up to the other, because the expenses were not paid ? This latter act would not release them from prior implied engagement, as common carriers, c., to send the furniture on, nor entitle them to hold on to it till the charges were paid. </em>If there was a contract releasing the defendants from further responsibility at Erie, or if the furniture had been brought by them to the place of destination, they could not have been required to deliver it up till their charges were paid them, unless they had been previously discharged. The value of the furniture is proven to have been $98, and the damage to it $25; and the plaintiff hav<a id="p174" href="#p174" data-label="174" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*174</a>ing laid his claim before the justice at $67, <em>the jury </em>cannot go beyond it, except to allow interest on it from the time his right of action accrued. This valuation was made at Erie, and there is no other evidence in relation to it, or the extent of the injury, and by this we must be governed. Inasmuch, then, as the plaintiff has limited his claim to a sum below what the evidence shows the furniture to have been worth, in its damaged condition, it is unnecessary to consider what the defendants are entitled to set off damages for injury done to the goods before they came to their possession. If there was any evidence showing that the goods were of less value when they came to the defendants’ possession in Erie, other than that of McHaffy’s, it would have to be considered, but both parties having rested upon it, the jury have nothing else to guide them in making up their verdict. In the absence of this, the value of the goods at this place would have been the proper standard for assessing the damages.”</p>

It was not, indeed, as separate and detached points, but in the comprehensive presentation of the case which the learned judge made. And this is generally the best and most instructive mode in which legal principles can be presented to a jury. It is intelligible, and exhibits to the jurors as well the principles as their bearing upon the facts in evidence. Nor is it unjust to the party who has asked specific instructions. If the points are not answered, he may consider them as negatived, and in this court, <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>therefore, the question will be whether they should have been affirmed.</p>

They asked the court to instruct the jury that the plaintiff had not shown property in himself, so as to enable him to maintain his action. The furniture, for the non-delivery of which the suit was brought, was shipped in New York, marked O. Colburn, Meadville, Pennsylvania, care Thompson &amp; Arbuckle, Erie, Penn. Thompson &amp; Arbuckle were forwarding and commission merchants at Erie, and common carriers between Erie and Meadville. Now that a consignee of goods delivered to a common carrier for transportation may maintain an action for failure to transport or deliver them, seems hardly to admit of doubt. The doubt has rather been Avhether the action could be maintained in the name of the consignor. And though it has been ruled that it may be, when the property in the goods is proved to have remained in the consignor, yet this is not at all in conflict with the right of the consignee to sue when there is no such proof of ownership. Here there was no other evidence of ownership than what was furnished in the bill of lading or receipt of the carrier, and these established a <em>primd facie </em>case of ownership in the plaintiff, sufficient to enable him to maintain the action: 6 Clark &amp; Fin. 600; Dutton <em>v. </em>Solmonson, 3 B. &amp; P. 582; Jacobs <em>v. </em>Neilson, 3 Taunt. 423; Dawes <em>v. </em>Peck, 8 T.

These points present only a part of the facts proved. There was no evidence that the plaintiff informed the defendants that he would send to Erie for the goods. He only promised to do so if the former carriers would allow the damages which the defendants thought right, and charged only a specified sum for freight. Neither of these things were done, and as the promise was made dependent upon the performance, it was no justification for refusal or neglect to deliver the goods at Meadville. Still less was the offer to receive them at Erie, refused by the defendants, unless upon terms imposed by themselves, a justification for non-compliance with their contract. The obligation of the contract was to carry the goods to Meadville. Doubtless if Colburn had received them at Erie, the carriers would have <a id="p177" href="#p177" data-label="177" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*177</a>been discharged; but an offer to receive them on certain conditions, not accepted by the defendants, and accompanied by a refusal to deliver them on those conditions, was wholly inoperative to relieve the carriers from the performance of their contract. We need not say that the attempt to extort in advance from the plaintiff freight which they had wrongfully paid, coupled as it was with his refusal to submit to the extortion, was no release of the defendants from their contract. The court, therefore, were perfectly right in refusing to affirm the third, fourth, and fifth points propounded by the plaintiffs in error.</p>
    <p id="b177-4" data-blocks='[["BL_177.4",177,[165,848,1169,551]]]'>There is nothing in the remaining assignments, and they need no discussion. It is said the defence was not put upon the ground of a new contract, but on the ground that the contract for carriage was superseded by the stoppage of goods in consequence of frost, and the subsequent conduct of the plaintiff by which the defendants were released. What is that but a new contract ? If the plaintiff discharged the defendants, it was done by agreement. Even a receipt of the goods at Erie, if they had been there received, would have been important only as showing that the plaintiff agreed to relieve the defendants from their obligation to deliver them at Meadville. None of the assignments of error are sustained, and the judgment must therefore be affirmed.</p>
