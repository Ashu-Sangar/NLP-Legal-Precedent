Of our right to take jurisdiction of such a case there can be no question. That our jurisdiction attached from the moment the <em>subpoena </em>was awarded, is equally clear. Though no special or preliminary injunction was issued, it is apparent that if the company could, after' service of subpoena, go on and sell bonds, they might defeat our jurisdiction altogether. I am not now speaking of the right of a purchaser from them, but only of their right to sell, and, under the circumstances of the case, we hold that the sale of bonds, after service of the <em>subpoena </em>in equity, and before final decree, was an attempt to remove the subject of litigation beyond our jurisdiction, and so a contempt.</p>

C. R. 566, delivered in 1815. Winter, a trustee of lands, was sued in equity by his <em>cestui que trust, </em>for breach of trust. Pending the suit he sold part of the trust lands to Ballou without any actual "notice of any breach of trust, or of any suit against the trustee, and for a full consideration, which Ballou paid. After full argument, Ballou was held to be a purchaser with notice, and was decreed to give up the land to the <em>cestui que trust </em>or to pay for it again. “ The established rule is,” said the chancellor, “ that a <em>lis pendens, </em>duly prosecuted, and not collusive, is notice to a purchaser so as to affect and bind his interest by the decree; and the <em>Us pendens </em>begins from the service. of the <em>subpoena </em>after the bill is filed.” He added, “that it is no more than the adoption of the rule in a real action at common law, where, if the defendant aliens after the pendency of the writ, the judgment in the real action will overreach such alienation.” It was one of the ordinances of Lord Bacon (see his Works, vol. 4, p. 511), laid down for the better and more regular administration of justice in the Court of Chancery — that “no decree bindeth any that cometh in <em>bond fide, </em>by conveyance from the defendant, before the bill exhibited, and is made no party, whether by bill or order; but where he comes in <em>pendente lite, </em>and while the suit is in full prosecution, and without any colour of allowance or privity of the court, there regularly the decree bindeth.”</p>

But we are a Pennsylvania tribunal, sitting in judgment on an occasional and extraordinary security for money created under Pennsylvania statutes. We know the history of these municipal and county bonds — how the legislature, yielding to popular excitements about railroads, authorized their issue; how grand juries, • and county commissioners, and city officers, were moulded to the purposes of speculators; how recklessly railroad officers abused the overwrought confidence of the public, and what burdens of debt and taxation have resulted to the people.

They are temporary, and will never be repeated again whilst the world stands. They are local in their origin, issued by counties, cities, and boroughs here in Pennsylvania, not for ordinary indebtedness, nor for purposes which belong naturally to such municipalities, and they are rendered lawful only by a special and extraordinary exercise of legislative omnipotence. Unlike bills of exchange, they do not grow up out of the daily business of mankind, but are creatures of statute law. They generally recite on their face, or refer to, the authority by which they exist. They are called by the legislature “ certificates of loans or bonds” — never notes or bills. They always bear a broad plain impress of a seal, which is the only test of their authenticity, and which, added to a bill of exchange, would instantly destroy its commercial character the world over. The only point of resemblance between them and bills of exchange <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>is, that both are payable to bearer; but let it be remembered, that any sealed instrument for money may be made to a particular payee “or bearer,” whilst no negotiable instrument can be made under seal. It may be added that the Constitution of Pennsylvania has been so amended as to forbid a future issue of such bonds — a provision which nobody ever regarded as a blow at commercial paper. These are distinctions which justify any court in refusing to treat bonds of this nature as commercial paper.</p>

I reply, the rights of innocent tax-payers cannot be protected if they are. No man can go over the history of these bonds and fail to see that there are two parties involved, both of whom are wprthy of the regards of the judicial eye. On the one hand, there are the purchasers who have invested their money, generally at a large discount, but on the faith that the people whose representatives have issued the bond will see to its redemption; and on the other, there are the people whose representatives have hurried them thoughtlessly into oppressive indebtedness, without an equivalent. Now, if equal justice is to be administered to both parties, no narrow and technical grounds can be assumed, and certainly the bond must not be treated as a bill of exchange. Nor can the coupon, for it is part of the same instrument, and is not of itself a complete contract.</p>

Seeing that the people have, at the least, <em>permitted </em>their accredited agents to issue them, and that <em>some </em>consideration was received for them in the stock subscribed, and in the progress of the work, there is reason in holding them bound to pay so much money on each bond as it brought into the treasury of the company. That money, whether honestly applied to the work or not, was honestly paid in, for the purpose of being so applied. For that money, when it falls due, and for the interest as it accrues, the county would seem, on all principles of equity and fair dealing, to be justly liable to the holder of the bond. But the holder ought not to have more than that money, because he, or others under whom he claims, purchased the bond of the company in violation of the only law which ever legalized the bond. It was forbidden to be sold under par, and all purchasers were bound to take notice of this. Generally, second and third, and more remote purchasers, pay less for such securities than the first purchaser from the company. So that when we give them the amount the first purchaser paid, they have nothing to complain of, except that the speculation turns out not quite as large as was intended.</p>

    <p id="b360-6" data-blocks='[["BL_360.4",360,[304,807,1163,248]]]'>This explanation of our position is necessary, as showing why we allow the rule of <em>Us pendens </em>its natural and legal operation in this case. Diamond did not buy mercantile paper, but <em>a, bond^ </em>— a bond that was the subject of a pending suit in equity, and, therefore, he purchased it with notice of all the facts of that record.</p>
    <p id="b360-7" data-blocks='[["BL_360.5",360,[305,1066,1161,418]]]'>But the statement of pur position on the above question, bears a more direct relation to one of the questions now before us. It is made a part of the case that the bonds were sold at sixty-four cents in the dollar, contrary to the Act of Assembly, and one of the questions submitted is, whether the plaintiff, if entitled to a judgment at all, would be entitled to a judgment for more than the bond sold for. We decide that he is entitled to no judgment, because of the <em>Us pendens ; </em>but that if he could recover at all, he could recover only the amount for which the company sold the bond.</p>
    <p id="b360-8" data-blocks='[["BL_360.6",360,[306,1495,1160,256]]]'>It is not necessary for us to discuss the irregularities of the subscription made by the county, nor the authority of the county to make it. In the case in 8 Casey, the subscription was held to be valid, and we should doubtless reach the same conclusion again, if we were to review the whole ground. But because it is not necessary, we forbear to do it.</p>
    <p id="b360-9" data-blocks='[["BL_360.7",360,[968,1752,454,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
