Two questions arose upon this account, and were the subject of exceptions to the report of the auditor, and also of a feigned issue directed to the Court of Common Pleas of Crawford county at the request of the accountant. The rulings of the court upon the trial of that issue, and the ultimate decision of the Orphans’ Court, are assigned for error here.

That the heirs or devisees of Judge Shippen have lost the sum of $1754.88, with interest; 2d. That this amount was lost through the neglect or default of I. Stuart Riddle, one of the executors, and whose account is now before us.
