It is true that most banks of discount do business greatly beyond their capital — they discount on their deposits and on their credit — but they do also discount on their capital. It is this indeed which attracts the confidence of depositors, and gives credit to the paper which they issue, so that the capital stock is the real foundation of all the business of the banks, and enters specifically into their discounts. If, therefore, the average quarterly discount business of the bank is to be taxed without taxing its capital, all that part of its business into which the capital enters must be laid out of the account, and the residue of its business only taxed. But how is the discrimination to be made ? The city assessor does not seem to have attempted to make it, and he would probably have failed had he attempted it. It may be true <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>that part of the tax assessed is not a tax of the capital, but it is unquestionable that part of it is a tax of the capital. To tax the business which capital performs is to tax the capital. This is as certainly true as that taxation of capital is a burthen on the business in which it is engaged. The least then that can be said of the city’s assessment is, that it is a tax on the capital of the bank to some extent, and, if to any extent, the bank has a right to complain of the infringement of its contract with the state. It has a right to say, the state stipulated that our capital stock should not be taxed for city purposes. Your tax is, in part at least, upon our capital stock, and until you distinguish that part, and withdraw it, we know not how much of your tax to pay, and therefore will pay nothing.</p>

To say that they did not intend a tax of the capital, would be to impute to the legislature ignorance of the fact that the capital of banks enters into their “ average quarterly business.” That they must have known when they passed the act. It would be scandalous to doubt it. Then their language is plain, that “the average quarterly business” shall be taxed for city purposes, which is a plain though not a very direct way of saying that the capital shall be taxed for city purposes.</p>

    <p id="b346-5" data-blocks='[["BL_346.4",346,[310,583,1174,1077]]]'>The Dartmouth College case having settled the general doctrine that legislative charters, like legislative grants of land, are contracts within the meaning of the Federal Constitution, the Supreme Court of the United States recognised it as <em>applicable </em>to banks in a question of taxation, in the ease of The Providence Bank <em>v. </em>Billings, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20P.%20514" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="4 P. 514">4 P. 514</a>, but refused in that case to consider a tax law as impairing the obligation of the contract, because the charter contained no stipulation against future taxation. This decision, pronounced in 1830, has been followed, as we have already seen, by this court, and the American courts have generally agreed that where a bank charter does not stipulate for exemption from further taxation, a law subsequently passed imposing further taxation is not a law impairing the obligation of the contract. I am not sure, however, that this is a fair statement of the present position of the Supreme Court of the United States, for in the case of the State Bank of Ohio <em>v. </em>Knoop, <a href="/us/57/0369-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="16 How. 369" data-case-ids="3483716" data-case-paths="/us/57/0369-01">16 How. 369</a>, Justice McLean, speaking for a majority of that court, held this language : “Every valuable privilege given by the charter, and which conduced to an acceptance of it and an organization under it, is a contract which cannot be changed by the legislature, where the power to do so is not reserved in the charter. The rate of discount, the duration of the charter, <em>the specific tax agreed to be </em>paid, and other provisions essentially connected with the franchise, and necessary to the business of the bank, cannot, without its consent, become a subject of legislative action.”</p>
    <p id="b346-6" data-blocks='[["BL_346.5",346,[310,1661,1171,519]]]'>This is making the exercise of the taxing power to depend on a power reserved in the charter, which is a long step in advance of the doctrine in the Providence Bank case and our own cases, where it is held to be free unless expressly restricted by something in the charter. How earnestly several of the judges dissented from this position, may be seen both from the report of this case and of that which immediately follows it in the same book — The Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company <em>v. </em>Debolt, 16 How. And how unsatisfactory this doctrine is to several state courts may be seen'by what was said, and the authorities cited on the subject, in the case of Mott <em>v. </em>The Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 6 Casey 31.</p>

That court, having brought all corporate rights within the clause of the Federal Constitution, which disables state legislation, acquires jurisdiction, necessarily, over disputes which spring up between corporations and the states which create them, where the decision of the state tribunals is favourable to the sovereignty of the state. The only exception to this would seem to be in the case suggested by Justice McLean, where the power is reserved in the charter to do what the state is complained of for doing.</p>
    <p id="b347-5" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[176,800,1161,77]]]'>The conclusions of that court on this subject may be stated thus:—</p>
    <blockquote id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.5",347,[173,886,1163,131]]]'>1. A grant of land or of a corporate franchise by an act of legislation, is a contract between the state and the grantee, the obligation of which a subsequent legislature cannot impair.</blockquote>
    <blockquote id="b347-7" data-blocks='[["BL_347.6",347,[172,1016,1165,204]]]'>2. If the legislature, in creating a corporation, prescribe a rate of taxation, and expressly release the power to impose further taxes, or do not expressly reserve the power to themselves, a subsequent tax law does impair the obligation of the contract, and is void.</blockquote>
    <p id="b347-8" data-blocks='[["BL_347.7",347,[171,1230,1165,431]]]'>The evident effect of these propositions is to place the taxing power of the state governments at the disposal of contracting parties. The legislature, representing the people, are one of the contracting parties — the corporators are the other. The theory is, that the legislature represent the people for the purpose of making contracts as well as for making laws; that the grant of a franchise is not merely an act of legislation, but is also a contract, and that the legislature holds the taxing power, and therefore may bargain it away, precisely as they hold and may grant the power of corporate franchises.</p>

We have seen that by the organic law of this bank certain specific taxes were imposed; that the power to levy further taxes <em>for state purposes </em>was not released, but that it was stipulated that the capital of the bank should not be subject to taxation for any other than state purposes. We have seen, also, that the law of 4th January 1859 does tax the capital stock of the bank for other than state purposes. The question then is, do the doctrines of the Supreme Court of the United States apply to this case ?</p>

    <p id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[292,925,1165,1499]],["BL_349.1",349,[145,407,1172,1380]]]'>By the 53d section of the General Banking Law of 16th April 1850, the power to alter and revoke bank charters is reserved in the very terms of the above constitutional provision. Losing sight, then, of none of the “ provisions, restrictions, immunities, or privileges” under which this bank was created, it may be said with great confidence that it accepted its charter under the express stipulation that the state sovereignty over it should remain unimpaired. The power to alter, revoke, or annul charters, whenever, in the opinion of the legislature, they become injurious to the citizens of the Commonwealth, was the utmost that was ever claimed in behalf of state sovereignty, and this the Iron City Bank conceded — subject to one only condition — that no injustice should be done to corporators. Whether this condition is to be judged of by the legislature or the courts may be a somewhat nice question. Generally, questions of justice and injustice are judicial in their nature, and I incline to think it is for the courts and not the legislature to decide whether the repeal or modification of a bank charter works injustice to the corporators. But assuming this to be so, it must also be assumed that the courts will never hold a tax law applicable alike to all the banks of a great city to be an act of injustice. We have repeatedly said that the taxing power is exclusively legislative, and not at all judicial, and that until the exercise of it became so extravagant and wanton as to be no longer in the nature of a legislative function, we would not attempt to arrest it. We would not see a citizen’s property confiscated under pretence of taxing it. That would be a case of manifest injustice. But when the legislature thinks that the banks and other corporations doing business in a particular city, and enjoying the protection of its police and other facilities for business, should contribute a reasonable part of their profits to the support of that city, and accordingly authorizes them all to be taxed according to a uniform rate, it is not for the judiciary to revise the legislative discretion, and to pronounce such a tax law an act of injustice to the corporators. Resumption of the franchise, or abridgment <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>of corporate powers without compensation, might be injustice to corporators — a general tax law for city ptrrposes is not. But it will be said the injustice consists in imposing a tax in violation of the fundamental compact that hone but state taxes should be imposed. The answer is, you agreed, when you took your charter, that the legislature might, in their discretion, disregard that condition, and therefore it is not unjust to you that on a fair exercise of discretion they have determined to disregard it. To give that condition the great effect claimed for it, would be to nullify the constitutional provision which was designed to protect state sovereignty from the entanglements of legislative bargains with banks. However it may be with other corporations— even if the doctrines of the federal courts should be held to exempt them from farther taxation, where they have obtained an express stipulation to that effect — no corporate body in Pennsylvania, with <em>lanhing or discounting privileges, </em>can claim the shield of those doctrines; because our Constitution forces upon the corporators the recognition and admission of an unimpaired state sovereignty to impose taxes according to legislative discretion. Every legislature sits under that constitutional grant of power, and since no legislature can repeal the Constitution, the stipulations of the legislature of 1857 with this bank could not abridge the powers of the legislature of 1859. The power of taxation is one thing, whether applied to state, city, county, borough, or township taxes. It is lodged with the legislature for exercise, according to its discretion, and in respect to banks, however it may be in respect to other corporations, it cannot he hampered by prior legislation. The Constitution was made to prevent such a result, and you must alter the Constitution before a bank can plead an indefeasible right to he exempt from taxes, general or local, which a legislature prescribes in the ordinary course of legislation.</p>

It may be said that the Act of 1859 neither alters, revokes, nor annuls the charter, and therefore is not within the purview of this clause of our state Constitution. Does it not <em>“ </em>alter” the charter ? That is the very complaint that is urged. If the charter says the bank shall pay no taxes hut state taxes, and the Act of 1859 says it shall pay city taxes also, I think it quite clear that the charter is altered. We are accustomed to speak of all the incorporating acts as constituting the charter, which is not strictly correct language, though accurate enough for all practical purposes. The Constitution used the word charter in its loose and popular sense rather than in its strictest signification. We regard, then, the general banking law of 1850 and its supplements as entering into and forming part of the charter of this bank, within the meaning of the word charter, as used in our state Constitution — and we look upon <a id="p350" href="#p350" data-label="350" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*350</a>the Act of 1859 as altering that charter, and because an ordinary tax law passed in pursuance of the reserved power, we hold it constitutional, without questioning any of the conclusions of the Supreme Court of the United States.</p>
