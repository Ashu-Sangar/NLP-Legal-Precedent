In June 1836, he entered into a written agreement with John Patchen, for the sale of 100 acres of this land, and in the same month did convey to him by deed, in fee simple, the other 100 acres, thus disposing of the whole tract. Both the deed and the agreement were duly recorded.</p>

In 1851, Rogers conveyed his interest therein to Mary R. Warren. In 1854, Newland and Warren conveyed to Filch and Boynton, and this was the defendant’s claim of title. At the time of making the agreement and deed to Patchen, the land of Goff was bound by two judgments, one in favour of Philtus Clark and one in favour of Jonathan Nichols. In 1840, executions were issued on these judgments, under which all the real estate of Potter Goff was sold to Nichols. Mr. Goff remained in possession until his death, which occurred in November 1845, with the understanding, as was averred, that he was to refund the purchase-money to Nichols, and receive from him the legal title when he had done so, or have the same conveyed to his order. In 1848, Nichols and wife conveyed the property to C. F. Luce and A. E. Goff, a son and step-son of Potter Goff, deceased, by the following assignment, written on the back of the sheriff’s deed:—</p>

But there is supposed to be evidence that Goff bought the land back from Nichols, and got him to convey it to Luce and another, and that therefore they ought to be held to stand as trustees for Patehen. We find some evidence of the fact of such a contract, but none that is adequate to operate upon the <em>title </em>so as to pass it in law or equity to Goff; for it is all parol and very indefinite, and nothing was done under it in Goff’s lifetime that equity treats as performance. Therefore Goff never got back the title, though he may have had a parol agreement to get it, and consequently Luce did not derive <a id="p318" href="#p318" data-label="318" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*318</a>title from him, and cannot be charged to hold it as Goff ought to have held it. He holds from Nichols, and not from Goff, and therefore by title paramount to Patchen’s. If any of Goff’s money was used in helping to make out Luce’s title, Patchen had no lien on it, and cannot, on that ground, follow the money into the land so as to get title to it, though Goff was his debtor.</p>
