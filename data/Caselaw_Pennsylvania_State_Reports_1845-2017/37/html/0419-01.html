The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit </em>and <em>non assumpsit infra sex amos. </em>It appeared from the evidence, that, in consideration of this intended devise, the plaintiff was to maintain his father during his life, and pay the other children the sum of $1000, at the rate of $125 per annum, commencing one year after his father’s death, and move from the farm which he then occupied, to that of his father, which he did in 1849 or 1850, where he remained until his father’s death in 1854; and that during that time he had expended considerable money in improvements on the farm, which was the subject of this alleged bargain. George Bender died intestate, and, on proceedings in partition, had in the Orphans’ Court, the farm was adjudged to the plaintiff at the appraisement.</p>

J.) refused so to instruct the jury, charging, however, “ that they must be satisfied that there was an absolute and unconditional contract between the plaintiff and his father, which had been complied with by plaintiff, and that the measure of damages in this case was the actual loss sustained, to wit, the value of the maintenance of the old man, and the iabour and expenditures bestowed on the land, less the rents and profits thereof.”</p>
