Peters, and William Curry, for conspiracy. The declaration contained two counts, charging the defendants with conspiracy, &amp;c., unlawfully to defraud, impoverish, &amp;c., by entering judgment on the docket of Peters, one of the defendants, in favour of Backhouse, another of the defendants, issuing execution thereon, and taking and carrying away by Curry (the other defendant) two horses, the property of the plaintiff, with averments of special damages, &amp;c., to which the defendants pleaded <em>not guilty. </em>While the suit was pending, Peters, one of the defendants, died, and the cause was tried May 3d 1860, between Gaunce as plaintiff, and Backhouse and Curry as defendants.</p>

The docket of Peters set forth the entry of an amicable action, the nature and amount of the plaintiff’s claim, and that no objection to it was made by the defendant ; but that he had' offered depositions in support of his claim, which were objected to and rejected, and that, as no further evidence was offered, the judgment was entered as above stated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b351-6" data-blocks='[["BL_351.4",351,[151,921,1170,342]]]'>It further appeared that the day on which Gaunce and Back-house met before Justice Peters, Gaunce brought suit against Backhouse, before Justice McAyeal. On the trial of this case (which took place April 6th 1858), Backhouse presented a transcript of the judgment which he had against Gaunce, on the docket of Peters, as a bar to the proceeding before Justice Mc-Ayeal, to which Gaunce objected, and judgment was entered in favour of Gaunce for $99 and costs.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b351-7" data-blocks='[["BL_351.5",351,[150,1268,1171,735]]]'>On the 21st of April, Backhouse sued out an execution, which was placed in the hands of Constable Curry, who, on the 3d of May, endorsed it, “returned for want of indemnity;” he also appealed to the Common Pleas, from-the judgment of Justice McAyeal. Gaunce sued out a certiorari, and succeeded in reversing the judgment of Justice Peters; he also recovered a verdict of $100 against Backhouse, on the appeal. It was also proved on the trial, that Backhouse had said, on the day he was sued, that “ Gaunce had got the start of 'him, and that he had intended to sue him, but had not time to do it;” that Peters had said, “the parties had met at his house, to try to settle, but could not; -and that, afterwards, Backhouse insisted that he should enter judgment for his claim, and that he did so;” but as to Constable Curry, there was no evidence of any act or declaration, except that, under the execution, he had taken Gaunce’s horses, and had returned them in a day or two, because the plaintiff would not indemnify him.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b351-8" data-blocks='[["BL_351.6",351,[148,2003,1171,376]]]'>The plaintiff having closed his case, the defendant offered no evidence, but moved the court for judgment of <em>nonsuit, </em>whereupon the court (Hampton, P. J.) entered judgment of nonsuit, with leave to move the court in banc to set it aside. On the 4th of May 1860, plaintiff’s attorney moved the court to set the nonsuit aside, but, on argument, the motion was denied, Avhereupon the plaintiff sued out this writ, and assigned for error : 1. The entry of the judgment of nonsuit; and 2. The refusal to set aside the nonsuit as above stated.</p>

The only injury done to plaintiff was taking his horse, and retaining it a day or two, on an execution issued against him on a void or voidable judgment.</p>
    <p id="b352-9" data-blocks='[["BL_352.11",352,[312,880,1170,1494]]]'>The charge here is that the plaintiff in that judgment (Back-house), and the justice and the constable, conspired to enter a false, fraudulent, and unlawful judgment, and did enter it and issue execution on it. There is no sort of evidence that the constable entered into such a conspiracy; and as there must be at least two persons to make a conspiracy, we may examine whether either of the others is free from it on the evidence. If he is, there is no conspiracy. Is there evidence of a conspiracy <em>against the justice ? </em>There is no direct evidence, and therefore it must be inferred, if found at all, from united acts of Back-house and the justice. A judgment was entered, but there is no evidence that it was false in amount, — Gaunce’s set-off being withdrawn. The fraud must, therefore, lie in the entry of the amicable action, when no such entry was agreed to. Is this proved ? Not at all. The justice never admitted anything like this; and, on this point, admissions of, or evidence against, Backhouse, go for nothing. The evidence rather is, that there was a controversy between Gaunce and Backhouse, to be settled before the justice, and that Gaunce had taken deposition for the occasion. Hamilton knew nothing about the submission, but was present at the attempted settlement, saw the depositions submitted to the justice, and stayed till the parties disagreed and separated. There is no evidence tending to prove that the justice made a fraudulent entry of the action, and, therefore, none to charge him with conspiracy. When Gaunce withdrew his depositions and went away, Backhouse insisted on a judgment for the amount of his claim, independent of the set-off, and this was granted, — the claim not having been objected to, as the docket entry says. No conspiracy by the justice can be inferred from this; for there is no evidence that the entry is untrue. That admission may have been made when the amicable action was agreed on. There is nothing contrary to this in Hamilton’s testimony, but rather in favour of it; for the facts related by him show plainly that they were not the commencement of the business.</p>
