The sheriff, having in his hands an execution at the suit of Van Winkle against Joseph M. Young, levied it on the contents of a printing office, which he found in possession of the debtor. Mrs. M. J. Young, the wife of the debtor, claimed to own a portion of the goods levied, and Alfred King claimed the residue. The sheriff applied to the court to direct an issue to determine the ownership of said property. The court awarded the issue, directing Mrs. Young and King to be made plaintiffs, and Van Winkle the defendant. On the trial of the issue, the defendant made three points, of which the first was, “ that unless the evidence shows each item of property in dispute was owned by both plaintiffs, the defendant is entitled to a verdict.”</p>

The question to be tried was the ownership of the goods, so far as concerned the sheriff’s right to levy. But as he could levy only goods that belonged to the defendant in the writ, it was quite immaterial whether the plaintiffs were joint owners, or owners in unequal proportions, if they were indeed owners of all the goods.</p>

This qualification was substantially a reassertion, of the ruling under the first point, and was, for the reasons stated under that head, unexceptionable.
