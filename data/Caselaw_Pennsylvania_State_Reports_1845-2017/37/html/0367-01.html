The evidence of this defence having been given, the learned judge instructed the jury that there was no evidence that the plaintiff below had any notice of the dissolution, and none to weaken the presumption that he was a <em>bond fide </em>holder for value, and that therefore the defence failed. This is the chief matter assigned for error, and it requires us to refer to the evidence ; for we must judge of the charge by the evidence given before the jury.</p>

There is no evidence that the endorsee had any sort of notice. It is quite plain, therefore, that the learned judge did not make any mistake of fact relative to the testimony. The question of law is therefore raised — is the endorsee required by this evidence to show that he is a <em>bond fide </em>holder for value? The answer of the law is, Yes, where the defendant has specially pleaded that the note was fraudulently issued, and that the holder gave no consideration for it; for then the plea gives the plaintiff notice of the defence: Harvey <em>v. </em>Towers, 15 Jurist 544; 4 Eng.
