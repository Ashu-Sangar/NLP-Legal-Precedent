It is more than a quarter of a century since the parties to the estate settled that it was to be divided on the ¡Drinciple of equality, counting in advances made in the testator’s lifetime, and that so he intended. It was so divided, and we can hardly be expeeted now to quash the arrangements.</p>

    <p id="b124-7" data-blocks='[["BL_124.5",124,[300,1020,1162,803]]]'>The testimony of the witnesses shows beyond dispute that the legatees, including Mrs. Howland, the complainant’s intestate, admitted, by word and deed, the several annual family meetings held with the executors for the purpose of arranging the estate; that those five who had received portions in the testator’s lifetime, were to get so much less under the will, so that all should be equal, and that this was the testator’s intention. The failure of the recollection about the details of the conversations does not at all weaken our confidence in its general tenor and effect; that is abundantly sustained otherwise. At several successive family meetings payments were made to the several legatees in the presence of each other, and receipts passed on this principle, until all were paid up in full, and some more than in full. In 1847 the final account of the surviving executor was filed, showing this distribution, and was confirmed. After that Mrs. How-land died, and in 1858 her administrators .seek to correct the mistake into which she and all the other parties had fallen twenty-eight years before, and on which they had acted throughout the whole administration of the estate. This cannot be allowed.</p>

We are not sure that even the law would not have adopted it, under the light in which they must have acted. The partial division of his estate in his lifetime not having been fully carried out as intended, he and his five children, to whom he granted lands by deeds, may have considered their portions in this division as debts due by them until the others should get their like shares, even though no bonds rvere given. Then they would be debts due the estate and not complete gifts, and thus equality in the final distribution would be secured.
