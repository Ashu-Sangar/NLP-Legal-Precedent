Whenever this is not accomplished by a demurrer, or by a general traverse of the facts set forth in the writ, it is generally -done by matters averred in the return by way of confession and avoidance. In which case the facts relied on to justify the refusal to obey the mandate of the writ, must be clearly and specifically set forth with sufficient certainty, and not argumentatively, inferentially, or evasively, so that the court may see at once that such facts, if established or admitted, are sufficient as the alternative for obedience to the writ: Tap. on Man. 347, <em>et passim, </em>Commonwealth <em>ex rel. </em>Thomas <em>v. </em>The Commissioners of Allegheny County, 8 Casey 218; The Commonwealth <em>ex rel. </em>Hamilton <em>v. </em>The Select and Common Councils of the City of Pittsburgh, 10 Casey 496.</p>

This is in substance the relator’s case; and if the respondents cannot in law successfully gainsay his title to the redress demanded, or in some other legal way defeat the remedy invoked, a peremptory <em>mandamus </em>must issue. And as that process is not in this instance adapted to, or intended to effect any purpose but that of enforcing the performance of the alleged duty of making provision for the payment of the interest on the bonds so issued, and as that duty is not divisible, it can only be satisfied by performance to the extent of the duty imposed, which will be by making provision for the payment of interest on the whole amount of the bonds mentioned in the writ, of which the relator is the holder of one, and which, so far as to call for the duty claimed, may stand as the representative of all the rest. The duty and obligation to perform it, if established as to the bond of the relator, establishes at least a <em>primd facie </em>case as to all the others issued at the same time, under the same authority, and for the same purposes, and <em>primd facie </em>equally entitled to the same meed of justice. The right of individual holders to demand any portion of the money claimed to be raised, is not determined in this proceeding.

This then is what may be called pleading by way of confession and avoidance; and, so far as this is the nature of the return, they place themselves in this position: that facts thus pleaded, being the presentation of a new case by way of defence, must be averred with certainty and positively, not argumentatively, inferentially, or evasively.

We decided in Thomas’s Case, and again in Hamilton <em>v. </em>The Councils, that our authority to issue such process as this was not circumscribed by the districts assigned to the court by the legislature, but that it extended throughout the state, without regard to the district in which the court might be in session at the moment of awarding it. The Constitution having imposed no other than the territorial limits of the state as the limit of jurisdiction of the court, although the legislature might well appoint districts in which to hold terms, for the convenience of parties, it is hardly necessary to say, that they possessed no power to impair the efficiency of the court by limitations not imposed by the Constitution.

This was an inference for the court to draw, from the facts; they cannot draw it from the inference of the party; and there is nothing else from which to draw it; for the facts constituting want of good faith, if there be such, are not averred.

The legislature must have regarded the company in full existence ; but whether or not, the Act was sufficient in itself to have revived the suspended animation of the company, even if that had been its condition at the time. No particular form of words is necessary to express the sovereign will if it sufficiently appears what was intended; and none other than the complete existence of the company as a corporation can be deduced from an act which fully authorized them to sell stock. And so was it regarded by the commissioners of the county of Allegheny; for within a little over six weeks after the act, they made the subscription in the name of the county to the road. Nothing was done by the county of Allegheny, or by any of its citizens, to stay the hands of the commissioners from making the subscription, or from issuing and paying over the bonds. If it were conceded that the county was not to be estopped after all this from denying the existence of the company, yet all would agree that such facts as would indubitably show that it was defunct, should be given to the court before they can be expected to say so, and throw the entire loss of the bonds on those who loaned their money on the faith of the legislature of the state, the county, and the company; but that has not been done here, and nothing equivalent thereto.</p>
    <p id="b282-7" data-blocks='[["BL_282.7",282,[294,1902,1162,162]]]'>The next thing alleged is, the invalidity of the subscription on account of the non-payment of two dollars and a half per share at the time of subscribing.

They bear date as of the time of the subscription, and as they were received instead of cash, it must be presumed they were received as cash. Thus, the entire subscription being paid, when made, it necessarily included the $2.50 per share, as well as the whole amount, and thus the objection fails.</p>

In the first section of the act of incorporation, the stock was limited to 6000 shares of $100 each; but by the 16th section of the same act, the stockholders were authorized, at any annual or special meeting, to increase it to a million of dollars. The 1st section of the .-Act of 18th April 1843, changed the nominal, or par value of the shares to $50, instead of' $100 each, and by the 9th section of the Act of 10th April 1846, the restriction ón the limitation to increase the stock was repealed. So that now we may fairly presume, that the capital was increased to an extent sufficient to authorize the subscription. How can any other possible inference arise against the facts, that the subscription was made by the county, and was received by the company, when the power to increase is patent on the face of the Acts of Assembly, and its exercise not denied by the respondents ? We also overrule this matter as insufficient.</p>

I will not take time now to obtrude my individual views of this decision; suffice it, that it was so decided, and to change it now, even if there were power to do so, after millions upon millions have been invested <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>on the faith of it, would badly square with public good faith, and be ruinous to thousands who have vested their all upon it.</p>

We have decided that bonds or certificates of loan issued by a municipal corporation,' is an ordinary and appropriate mode of borrowing money, and the Act of 1853 expressly authorized the issue of such securities. The subscriptions were accordingly made, and the bonds issued. Thus was a lawful debt incurred by the county, and as no other than the ordinary mode of extinguishing it, or of paying the interest thereon, was provided, it follows of course, that the ordinary mode of raising the means must be resorted to, namely, to provide for it in the annual assessment of taxes for county purposes.

The day for such a defence has gone by, if it ever'existed, and justice demands a conscionable defence to set aside obligations solemnly entered into. This is not conscionable, and it is neither a legal nor an equitable plea. No court would hold a party bound to make any inquiry after such a matter, for there is nothing to suggest inquiry; and they would hold not only the county bound -by the regularity asserted in the fact of delivering the bond in the form • adopted, and estop it from denying it, but they would further hold that the power of the commissioners was not exhausted until the act of subscription was completed between the county and railroad. The evidence of its completion on the part of the county, was the delivery of the bonds; and of the company, its receipt of them and the delivery of the stock. It is impossible that this evidence of completeness shall be set aside by some anterior temporary arrangements, for the convenience of all parties.

All this is one plea; it is undivided by paragraph or period. The first branch, if we comprehend it, is intended as a denial of the legality of the transfers by the company, as being in conformity with the Acts of Assembly mentioned, for the reason that the resolutions fixing the rate at which the bonds might be sold, were not <em>recorded </em>in such manner as to give notice, &amp;c. And further, if such resolutions were procured, it was done secretly. This evidently places the illegality of the sale and transfer upon the fact of a want of a proper entry of the resolutions in the minutes of the board of commissioners. There is no prescribed publicity required in the passagé of such resolutions that I am aware of; and whether the act of doing it was very public or very private, it seems to me is a matter of indifference, as it is not alleged that privacy was part and parcel of a corrupt scheme to procure the passage of the resolutions. It is not so charged. That resolutions, authorizing a sale below par, were passed on the 5th of April 1855, is shown by a certified copy filed with the suggestion in this case; and this accounts for the narrow ground assumed to impeach the regularity of the transfer; namely, that they were not properly <em>recorded. </em>I think the demurrer admits this. But what then ? Are the holders of bonds to be defeated by the negligence or error of the commissioners in the performance of their duty ? There is nothing on the face of the bonds to induce a suspicion that all the supposed requisites had not been performed. The contract contained in the bonds was with <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>the bearer — with all and any who might purchase them. They passed simply by delivery. Under such circumstances, is it easy to entertain the honesty of the position, that, notwithstanding the form was such as to invite purchasers to invest their money in them, that still they were liable to be defeated and rendered worthless by omissions not appearing or to be presumed in official action in their creation ? Such a position sustained, would be an effectual trap to snare the most vigilant.</p>
    <p id="b287-5" data-blocks='[["BL_287.5",287,[163,750,1167,1376]]]'>The understanding may be said to be universal, that securities, in the form of these bonds, payable to bearer, can only be defeated by notice of such facts as would render them invalid. There must be notice, or its equivalent, for the form itself is a contract that the obligors mean' to make no defence, at least on account of acts and omissions of their own; and that the securities may be taken without inquiry as to this. The general authority to create the bonds is surely all that a purchaser need look to, together with the performance of such other matters as may appear by the bonds themselves to be requisites. If these bonds be not negotiable, according to the law merchant, as has been held, still it has never been held, that the obligors may be permitted to allege their own omissions to defeat their contract. They have chosen to say in effect, under a law authorizing them to choose the form of their obligation, “we will pay to any holder, whoever he may be, or wherever the purchase may be made, in Europe or in America, these bonds, and interest according to their tenor, and we pledge <em>the faith, credit, and property of the county </em>therefor.” This is the substance of the undertaking, and we cannot agree to interpolate the implication that this was said with a mental reservation, that the promise was only to be good if the obligors have , performed their duty rightly. This is not implied in the form, nor is it implied in the character of the officers executing the obligation. It may be true, as a general rule, that corporations, municipal perhaps, are not estopped by the acts of their agents; still I apprehend it is not so universal as to be without limit or exception; if it were so, it would be contrary to good morals, and the first principles of honesty; for it would permit the corporation to claim and hold the benefit of its contracts, and escape the burthen of paying the consideration. In short, to allow a party to take advantage of his own wrong.</p>

Public business could never be done under such a system. There must be faith in public servants within the scope of their authority, or public business must stop. For defective execution the public, whose servants they are, must suffer, not innocent parties. In substance we decided this in Thomas <em>v. </em>The Commissioners, 8 Casey 218.

They are in substance: — 1. That the respondents are not called upon to answer parties not named, and is accompanied, by an interrogatory whether there is not a misjoinder in introducing in this case the fact of the existence of other bonds, and in claiming the performance of the duty of providing for the payment of interest of them, as well as on that held by the relator. We have adverted to this in another place. That this was proper on part of the relator, see also Hamilton <em>v. </em>The Councils, and Thomas <em>v. </em>The Commissioners. 2. That the bonds being under seal, are open to all legal defences to which they were subject in original hands, and that the holders thereof are affected with notice of any defects in their execution, by reason of the references therein to the laws under which they were issued. But the references to the statutes is not notice that there was defective performance under them.

That there is a specific legal remedy, that is to say, by action or suit. We know of no form of action against the commissioners which would be a specific remedy to compel them to assess taxes necessary to pay interest on their bonds, or, in other words, to enforce the performance of the legal duty to provide for the interest. That <em>mandamus </em>is a proper remedy in such cases has been decided in the cases above referred to.</p>
    <p id="b290-7" data-blocks='[["BL_290.5",290,[330,797,1165,298]]]'>In the next place, it is averred that there is no authority to levy a tax for the payment of the interest by the county. We have already treated of this, and said that the authority to create the debt implies an obligation to pay it, and where no special mode of doing so is provided, it is also implied that it is to be done in the ordinary way — by the levy and collection of taxes. This plea is insufficient.</p>
    <p id="b290-8" data-blocks='[["BL_290.6",290,[330,1096,1164,933]]]'>Again: it is averred that the commissioners cannot in one year exceed one per cent, on the adjusted valuation for county purposes, and that as other proceedings, similar in purpose to the present, are pending to coerce a provision for the payment of interest on two millions of dollars, or thereabouts; this, with the assessment for ordinary purposes, will greatly exceed the limit of one per cent. — and that they believe that one per cent, will be required to meet the ordinary wants of the county. This plea is uncertain and contingent, and is not good. It is not averred that in obedience to any proceedings against them, or otherwise, they have determined on and directed the levy of a tax to the extent of their authority, but only that they may be called on to do so; and inasmuch as they may be called on to go further than they have authority, they will not consent to assess any tax for the payment of any interest. Had they averred a resolution or determination to levy to the extent of their authority, quite another question would have been presented. But I will not anticipate it. Nor is the asseveration of belief that one cent on the dollar will be required for ordinary purposes, sufficient. Facts upon which that belief was founded should have been set forth, so that the court might judge whether it was well founded or not.</p>

It is within very common observation, that the adjusted valuation of taxable property in Allegheny county, as also in many other counties, is immensely below the real yalue. Everybody knows this, and thus a rate may be high, when in fact, if assessed on a fair valuation, it would be very low. Apparent high rates on low valuations are always unjust to the <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>public, and create discontent, when in fact the burthen is much more apparent than real.

The relator sets forth the equivalent of this in charging a refusal to provide for its payment, and the facts to establish it, viz.: the assessment of it by one board of commissioners in 1857, and its countermand not long afterwards. These facts are not denied by the respondents, but, on the contrary, they are justified by them as done in “ obedience to the express wishes of the people.” This was predetermined refusal, and, standing in this position always afterwards, of what avail would a demand have been ? Acts and declarations amounting to a refusal, and showing that such would have followed a demand, would certainly dispense with, because equivalent to, a demand. The law does not exact the performance of vain things, and it would have been idle enough in the face of such acts to have made a demand. If the commissioners had shown that it would have been effectual, it is not probable that the plaintiff would have taken much by his writ. This point, however, was decided against the respondents in Hamilton <em>v. </em>The Councils, and we reiterate it here.</p>

It is that no power existed in the county to subscribe for stocks, and that none was “ conferred by the inhabitants of said county, or any of the non-resident freeholders and proprietors of lands situate therein, upon the commissioners to subscribe to the capital stock of the said company.’.’ This may be true in one sense, in another it is not; for as the “inhabitants and non-residents” did not possess legislative power, it certainly could not be conferred directly by them, but being-conferred by the legislature, it was of course conferred by the representatives of the inhabitants and non-residents of the county, the only constitutional power capable of doing so, as known to our institutions; the immediate representatives of the county pressing for it in the name of their constituents.

And <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>further, that the exercise of the taxing power invoked by the relator, is an act of sovereignty resting in the will of the respondents, and cannot be coerced — in short, that the commissioners are <em>imperium in </em>imperio. But, in the cases so often referred to against the city and county, it has been determined, that the duty to assess a tax is enforceable, and that <em>mandamus </em>is the appropriate remedy; and consequently that the commissioners and councils are not sovereign in this behalf.
