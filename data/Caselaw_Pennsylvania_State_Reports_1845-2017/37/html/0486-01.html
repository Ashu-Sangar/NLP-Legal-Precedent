The courts, in granting injunctions, are not restricted to acts “contrary to law,” but may exercise this power, to restrain acts contrary to equity also ; equity being so much a part of the law of Pennsylvania, as that the word “ law” often means both law and equity, or either.</p>

While in business, the firm became the owner of a tract of land in Washington county, and it was agreed by the partners that Ullery, one of the firm, should take the deed in his own name, sell the land, and apply the proceeds to the debts of the firm.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b486-10" data-blocks='[["BL_486.9",486,[317,1332,1163,561]]]'>Ullery sold the farm to Iioontz &amp; Workman, made them an absolute deed for it, and received from them two negotiable promissory notes drawn in his favour, one for $3500, due April 1st 1859, and one for $4000, due April 1st 1860. These notes Ullery deposited with the “Banners’ and Drovers’ Bank of Waynesburg” as collateral security for his own individual debt. While the bank held these notes, Stockdale, Cope, and Long, the other members of the firm (which was then dissolved), filed their bill in equity, setting forth the above facts, and praying for an injunction to restrain the bank from further negotiation or use of the notes, except they be used for the use and payment of the debts of the firm; and to “take such further action in the premises as may appear to be just and reasonable.”</p>

The bank demurred to the bill, on the ground that the complainants had not, by their own showing, made out such a case as entitled them, in a court of equity, to an injunction, either against the bank or against Jacob Ullery; nor to relief from or against the defendant or the bank, touching the matters contained in said bill.</p>
