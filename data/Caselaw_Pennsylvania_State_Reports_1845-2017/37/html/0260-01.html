Our Acts of Assembly only empower the courts to hear the parties, and dissolve the writ, and “take such further order as is just and right,” which is no authority for such a bond. Even if the bond was legal, it could not be sued out until the controversy about the title is ended. If the judgment on the first ejectment were reversed on writ of error, or the possession restored to defendants by the second ejectment, the plaintiffs would be entitled to no damages, for they would have sustained no injury.

It was because the courts did not exercise this authority as freely as they ought to have done that some of the statutes relative to estrepement were passed: see Fitzh. N. B. 139; 10 Vin. Ab. 497; Rob. Dig. 418.</p>

A bond to the plaintiff is not an improper form of giving such security. If the plaintiff recover in his action of ejectment, he establishes his right to the possession of the property in as good a condition as it was when the action was brought, and therefore to all damages done to it in the meantime. The very purpose of the estrepement bond is to secure him this, and it does not depend upon any subsequent action relative to the title to the land. The court below was therefore right in all its rulings in the case.</p>
