Howell, to recover about twenty-four perches of land in Spruce Hill township, Juniata county. The plea was “not guilty.” Under the charge of the court there was a verdict and judgment in favour of defendant. The plaintiff then sued out this writ, and assigned for error the instruction of the court as to the binding obligation of a oonsentable division line which the evidence showed had been made between a former owner of the land and his neighbour, the plaintiff’s vendor; by which the land claimed by the plaintiff had been set off'as the property of the person under whom the defendant held.</p>

This was done fairly and openly, and, by the settled law of Pennsylvania, clearly concluded both parties as to the ownership of the land on each side of this established line at that time. Neither could have successfully maintained an ejectment against the other.</p>
    <p id="b59-8" data-blocks='[["BL_59.12",59,[177,1050,1167,507]]]'>In 1836 Milligan bought the Kasner title to a tract of 2 acres 31 perchos, which covers part of both the Hogg and Chambers tracts, as designated by the line run by Milligan and Briner in 1833, three years before. After this purchase, which includes the land now in dispute, Howell, the present defendant, in 1843, was about to dig a well on land he owned adjoining. Briner and Milligan were called on in reference to this line, and both, in the presence of Howell, assented to the line as established by them in 1833. In 1854, Howell bought from Boozle, the owner of the Briner title, 120 perches running to the consentable line of 1833, and built a storehouse upon it, fenced it up, and has been in possession since.</p>

Morrison, the plaintiff, 1 acre 30J perches, part of the Hogg survey, but not including any of the land now in dispute; and on the 29th September 1857, he conveyed to the plaintiff 2 acres 55 perches as part of Hogg’s survey, taking in, as alleged, part of the disputed land, and on the 6th September 1858, his son and devisee, James B. Milligan, by another deed conveyed to the plaintiff 2 acres 58 perches, embracing 3 perches more, the two deeds covering the 24 perches, the subject of this ejectment, and the store and improvements put upon them by the defendant.</p>

He ought to have inquired of Howell, who was in possession, by what title he held, and, having failed to do so, he cannot take from him both the land and the buildings he must have known he had erected.”</p>

There can he but one answer to this question, and this was given by the jury — that he could not — under a perfectly fair instruction from the court.</p>
