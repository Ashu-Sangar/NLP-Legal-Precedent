A portion of these lands, including the pond and mills, was sold by him to Baltzer Orth, who, in 1792, sold to one Grenawalt, granting to him also the “right to take water from the pond to the adjoining meadows.”</p>

In 1833, the company made some alteration in their works, and erected on their own lands a steam-engine, to pump the water from the pond into the then summit level. This engine went into operation in 1834, and has remained unchanged in power or capacity up to the present time, although the canal has been enlarged. At times it diverts nearly the whole stream into the canal, diminishing, of course, the value of the water-power below. In 1835 the company made an agreement with some of the millers on this stream, below them, for compensation to be paid for the use of the water; which agreement was to last until April 1st 1836, and was not to be an admission of the liability of the company, or in prejudice of the right of either party, after that period. In 1837 a similar agreement with same stipulations was made, and providing further, that either party might, during its continuance, adopt measures to have the liability of the company to pay for the water, legally examined. In 1839, “ The Union Canal Company” bought back the mills, pond, and part of the land. In 1845, Heilman, the complainant, became the owner of one of the mills on the Quitapahilla, below the com<a id="p102" href="#p102" data-label="102" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*102</a>pany’s engine and pumping apparatus.

But it is not every case which will furnish a right of action against a party for a nuisance, which will justify the interference of courts of equity to redress the injury, or to remove the annoyance. There must be the absence of an adequate remedy at law. A common trespass is not the foundation for an injunction, where it is only contingent, fugitive, or temporary. But if continued so long as to become a nuisance, in such a case an injunction ought to be granted, to restrain the person from committing it: 2 Story’s Eq. Juris., § 925. So obstruction of watercourses, the diversion of streams from mills, and the pulling down of the banks of rivers, thereby exposing adjacent lands to inundation, or mills to destruction: Id. 927.</p>

IIow does the plaintiff’s right stand under this head ?

    <p id="b103-8" data-blocks='[["BL_103.8",103,[184,1540,1174,428]]]'>During this time and since, expensive improvements have been made on the defendant’s works, but up until 1855, no objection to the use of the water seems to have been interposed. Por two years afterwards, while the company were enlarging their canal, the water was not much used, and no notice was given by the plaintiff that its use might not be continued as hitherto. But since the enlargement, the works have gone into the hands of trustees for creditors, and payment for the right have not been made as perhaps they should have been, and this is the reason for the present bill.</p>

If there be injury under such circumstances, the compensation accepted proves that it was not irreparable. It would be <em>damnum sine injuria. </em>It could not be classed under head of <a id="p104" href="#p104" data-label="104" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*104</a>injuries of which equity takes cognisance. Hence the acquiescence and compensation here preclude the remedy by injunction.</p>

It matters not now what the character of the original diversion was after such an acquiescence in it and compensation. Equity would not, in such a case, destroy the defendants’ works, now an important public thoroughfare, by restraining their use as a public highway, but leave the plaintiff to his remedy at law. In this view the injunction would be improper.</p>
    <p id="b104-7" data-blocks='[["BL_104.5",104,[312,962,1164,173]]]'>The bill was not framed to enforce the specific execution of a contract to pay a yearly sum for the right to use the water.

The remedy is what is to be looked at. If it exist, and is ordinarily adequate, its possible want of success is not a consideration. It is not intended here to say that insolvency is never a consideration moving a chancellor. It frequently does, but not alone. The equitable remedy must exist independently. In balancing cases, it is a consideration that gives preponderance to the remedy. Hence, the alleged insolvency of the company, and the supposed inability to collect damages that may be recovered from it, is no reason for interfering by injunction; nor do we decide what parties may be amenable to the plaintiff.</p>
