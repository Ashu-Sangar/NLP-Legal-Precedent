He contracted at that sum, without including items indispensable to their completion as dwellings, for the amount of which he claimed credit in his account, together with moneys paid for discount and interest, though shown to have had the contract price in hand at the time fixed for payment. <em>Held, </em>that those credits ought not to be allowed.</p>

Upon the application of her guardian, an act was passed on the 11th March 1851, by which the Orphans’ Court of Allegheny county was authorized to grant unto him, John Scott, guardian of said minor, upon his application to said court, authority to make such improvements on her real estate in the city of Allegheny, as to the said court may seem conducive to the interest of his said ward, and to direct said guardian to apply such portion of the personal property of the said ward thereto as in the judgment of the said court may be necessary therefor.</p>
    <p id="b378-10" data-blocks='[["BL_378.12",378,[293,1429,1173,556]]]'>On the 27th of September 1851, the guardian presented a petition to the Orphans’ Court, reciting the provisions of this Act of Assembly, and praying the court for authority to erect on the said real estate of his ward three two-story brick dwelling-houses, with back kitchens, &amp;c., at a cost not exceeding $2700. The court granted the prayer of the petition, and directed the guardian to apply thereto of the personal property of the ward an amount not exceeding $2700, leaving in his hands for other wants of the minor less than $800. The auditor, in his report, made a balance in favour of the guardian of $769.09; allowing all his charges against the buildings, over and above the sum fixed by the court, besides a discount of $25, with interest, amounting to $30.50.</p>

He must therefore have known that he was exceeding the limit fixed by the court when he made this contract, and must therefore be charged with those expenses, which should have properly been <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>included in the original estimate of the cost of these improvements. Any other rule, applied to a case like the present, might enable a guardian of his own volition to change the whole character of a ward’s property, and run her into a debt which she might have no means of paying.
