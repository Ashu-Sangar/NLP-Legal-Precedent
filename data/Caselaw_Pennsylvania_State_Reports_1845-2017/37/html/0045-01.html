Nor was it error to reject a question relating to the acts and declarations of the wife, on the day when the murder was committed; they were not evidence in favour of the prisoner, and were irrelevant.</p>

But in certain cases where it becomes material to inquire whether the act was committed deliberately or not deliberately, wilfully or not wilfully, the fact of the party charged with the act being drunk at the time of its commission, has been held to be a circumstance proper to be taken into consideration by the jury. A man may be so drunk as to be incapable of forming any intention, and yet capable of committing great violence. He is not irresponsible, criminally, because of his drunkenness, only in so far as intent is of the essence of crime committed by him when in that state. In a case of murder, if the jury was satisfied of his incapacity of will or of deliberation, growing out of drunkenness at the time of the murder done, it would be its duty to convict only in the second degree. Whether the prisoner was in such a state of mind — was so drunk at the time of the assault made by him upon the deceased, as to be unable to form a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated design to kill her — is a fact to be determined by the jury from the evidence in the case.</p>

      <em>the jury can deduce from the evidence of his conduct and manner in hilling the deceased, </em>as to be unable to form a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated design to kill, then he is guilty of murder in the second degree. We are free to confess that we do not know to what ‘other cause’ this points than to insanity, or to <em>delirium tremens, </em>or to <em>mania a potu, </em>which are forms of insanity produced by drunkenness. It would be a dangerous thing, as wo conceive, for a jury to deduce such conclusions from the conduct and manner of an act of homicide. Barbarity, atrocity, fiendishness, utter disregard of man, publicity of the crime, indifference to its consequences in not seeking flight or concealment, a life of drunkenness, it seems to us, are not elements from which a jury could safely draw so grave a conclusion as that this prisoner from some ‘other cause’ was unable to form a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated design to take the life of the deceased.] It is for the jury, however, to draw conclusions for themselves. The facts are for the jury absolutely and exclusively. The court has no power over the facts of any case. The court may express an opinion upon facts, but that expression of opinion is not to bind the jury. If the jury can draw the deduction from the evidence as to the prisoner’s conduct and manner of killing the deceased, or rather in killing her, that from some ‘other cause’ he was unable to form a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated design to kill her, then he would be guilty of murder in the second degree.”</p>

The court erred in answering the prisoner’s eighth point, which was as follows: “If the jury find the killing was the result of sudden passion, caused by any provocation, however slight, acting on a mind shattered by dissipation and long-continued indulgence in strong drink, to such an extent as to render the prisoner unable to master himself and form a cool and deliberate purpose to kill, the prisoner cannot be convicted of murder in the first degree.

If the law gives this right now, the reason for standing a juror aside until the panel is exhausted has ceased, and with it the right. With regard to this juror, the Commonwealth undertook to show cause, hut failed.

The questions overruled by the court, as given in the third, fourth, sixth, and seventh assignments of error, were proper, as the evidence which they were intended to elicit would have tended to show the state of the prisoner’s mind when the offence was committed.

The Act of 1774, which conferred civil jurisdiction upon justices of the peace to the extent of ¿620, and the Act of 1810, further extending it to $100, together with the provision making the magistrate’s judgment final under $5.34, are of this sort. The restrictions upon the enjoyment of the right of trial by jury, involved in the necessity of entering bail, as provided for in these acts for an appeal, although it cannot be doubted but that it is to some extent a clog upon the right, was never held to be an infraction of the constitutional provision, the ultimate right being retained: <a href="/binn/1/0416-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Binn. 416" data-case-ids="1787907" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0416-01">1 Binn. 416</a>, 6 S. &amp; R. 240, 4 Id. 135, 16 Id. 242.

This is too narrow and rigid a rule for the practical workings of the constitution and the rights guarantied by it in the particular in question. There is no violation of the right unless the remedy is denied, or so clogged as not conveniently to be enjoyed. But, in practice, the giving of bail, making affidavits, and entering appeals, has never been found so onerous as to amount to any serious derogation from the right. The framers of the constitution in which this right has been so sedulously guarded, undoubtedly knew and intended that legislation must provide the forms under which the right was to be enjoyed, and they meant no more than that it should be enjoyed under regulations which should not take away the right deemed necessary to order itself.</p>

It would be .difficult to prove that a limited number of such challenges by the Commonwealth necessarily deprives the prisoner of any of his rights. Impartiality is to be presumed, and is the right on both sides in a criminal trial. To attain this was undoubtedly the object of allowing challenges at all. Whatever, therefore, tends to this end and no more, surely takes away no right. The prisoner’s right is to have a common law trial by a jury of twelve good, true, and lawful men of the county; and until it be proved that allowing the Commonwealth four peremptory challenges impairs that right, complaints and objections are not to be regarded.</p>

Is not this simply organization, a form through which it is necessary to pass to arrive at a trial ? That it is so is strongly asserted by Black, C. J., in McFadden <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 11 Harris 12. And so it has been held by the Supreme Court of South Carolina, Cregan <em>v. </em>Bunton, <a href="/scl/33/0487-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="2 Strob. 487" data-case-ids="8486852" data-case-paths="/scl/33/0487-01">2 Strob. 487</a>.

The next alleged error was in the practice allowed the Commonwealth of “ standing aside” jurors, as it is called, without immediately showing cause of challenge. . This is a practice ancient and uniform, it is believed: 5 Bac. Abr. 365. In 2 Bac. Abr. 764, it is spoken of thus: “It hath also been agreed, and is now the established practice of the courts, that if the King <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>challenge a juror before the panel is perused, he need not show any cause'of his challenge till the whole panel be gone through and it appear that there will not be a full jury without the persons so challenged: Co.

They all relate to offers of evidence of the same general character, overruled by the court and excepted to on the part of the prisoner. They may be stated in short to be the rejection of the following questions: First, “ Whether the prisoner was not generally drunk when out of work?” Secondly, “ Did he not move quicker when drunk than sober ? with a view to follow it with proof that he did move quickly on the occasion of the killing.” Thirdly, “ To prove that his wife went to Kalbach’s on the morning of the day on which the killing took place, and forbade him from selling Warren liquor, saying “that he was drunk and abused her.’ ” Fourthly, “That Mrs. Warren had pledged a watch sometime before for liquor, that Warren got more on account of it — took it out in liquor.” And fifthly, “ To show the effect liquor had on Warren, beginning several years back; in making him wicked and crazy, and that it had a peculiar effect on his constitution and brain.”</p>

To reduce the grade of the crime, therefore, where the evidence on the part of the Commonwealth was such as to make out a <em>primá facie </em>case of murder in the first degree, evidence showing want of deliberation, or, which is the same thing, an incapacity to deliberate, is of course proper to be received. But it behooves the prisoner, in a case where death is produced by repeated brutal assaults on a helpless person, at considerable intervals of time, resulting at last in death, to meet the question of premeditation by competent evidence and which would serve to show a condition and state of mind, in which <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>it was at least improbable that deliberation could have directed his acts. Unexplained, the case here was such that a jury could scarcely have failed, if they regarded their oaths, to find it a case of wilful and premeditated killing.

It did not prove either the fact of being drunk at the time, or that he had no work. It was the fact that was wanted — from that the inference of want of deliberation might have been drawn. But it was asked here to infer that he was out of work, and therefore drunk, because he was generally so when out of work, and hence to infer from the inferred drunkenness, that he could not act deliberately. This mode of proof the law will not sanction, and we need only state the proposition to demonstrate the fallacy of the attempt.</p>

Had this been preceded or followed by proof of intoxication at the moment of the commission of the crime, it might have been proper. But it seems to us not to be distinguished in principle from the questions already disposed of. It was an effort to raise an inference of intoxication from the violent acts of the prisoner in consummating his crime, unaided by proof that that was the impelling cause to its commission. Of what avail would it be to show the effect of intoxicating liquors on the prisoner, and that, when taken to excess, it rendered him crazy, violent, and unmanageable, unless it had been shown that he had partaken of it in sufficient quantities to produce the effect ? The consequences flowing from the ordinary use of intoxicating liquors amounted to nothing unless it was shown that they were the cause that produced the effect. The proof offered was intended to establish a certain relation between cause and effect. The effect of intoxication might have been established by well known theory, but it was put upon experience in regard to the prisoner — that it usually produced certain results upon him. It was not shown to have produced that effect in the case in hand. The effect was offered as a substitute for both cause and effect. There was no proof of intoxication, excepting as inferential from his acts proved. But, if allowed <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>to be proved in this way, it could always be by violent acts, in any one. This is not to be thought of. When the prisoner was arrested, a few hours after the commission of the crime, not a single witness spoke of him as intoxicated. In the absence of proof of this kind, the testimony, the substance of this bill of exception, was irrelevant, and properly overruled by the court.</p>

To tlio argument that the manner of killing was evidence of intoxication or insanity from “ some other causewhile the court very properly told the jury that “ barbarity, indifference to consequences, and a life of drunkenness, it seems to us are not elements from which a jury could safely draw so grave a conclusion, as that the prisoner from ‘ some other cause’ was unable to form a wilful, deliberate, and premeditated design to take the life of the deceased,” yet he added, “ it is for the jury to draw conclusions for themselves. The facts are for the jury, absolutely and conclusively.” This gave the prisoner a full and fair chance under the arguments of counsel, which would no doubt have been effectual to have saved him if there had been ground from which to infer insanity from any cause.</p>

For this reason we need not discuss the merits of the proposition, but we must say that the doctrine, that if “ any doubts” are in the mind of the jury on the point of deliberation, their verdict should be for murder in the second degree, is going a step beyond the rule.
