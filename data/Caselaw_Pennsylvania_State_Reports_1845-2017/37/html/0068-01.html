    <p class="summary" id="b68-13" data-blocks='[["BL_68.11",68,[317,1574,1169,774]]]'>Smuller was collector of tolls for “ The Union Canal Company,” at Middletown, to which office he had been appointed by the company, but resigned on the first of May 1858. At the date of his resignation, he had in his hands, arising from the tolls of 1859, the sum of $4.41. There was also $145.98 due for tolls during his term, which he had not collected. The balance of the sum claimed in the suit, came into his hands in this way. Joseph Chamberlain had a judgment against the company, for about $14,000, which was cancelled by a partial payment in cash, and by three notes of the company due at different dates. To pay one of these notes, which had been protested, a resolution of the Board was passed in December 1857, by which the “ collector at Middletown” was directed to pay $500 on account thereof, promptly, and to apply to it one-half of his weekly receipts from the opening of the navigation in 1858, until June. Under this resolution he received and paid over, on said note, the sum of $1830.78, being the one-half of his weekly receipts, less two cents, the other half having been paid to the company.</p>

But the set-off claimed by the defendant was disallowed, and judgment entered in favour of the plaintiff, on a verdict for the sum which the defendant admitted was in his hands, with interest, whereupon the defendant sued out this writ, and assigned for error:—</p>

Independent of their existence, we are of opinion that he could not defalcate against the claim of the plaintiff below. The relation which he sustained to the company forbade it. He had received the money for which he was sued for a particular purpose. The $4.41 received by him as collector of tolls had been appropriated before it came to his hands, and he was constituted the agent of the company to pay it to Chamberlain. The other sum of $427.67 was placed in Ms hands for the same purpose, and it would have been a fraud on his part to have accepted it from Snavely, his successor as collector, except as the agent of the company to pay the Chamberlain note. Indeed it was expressly agreed at the trial that “he received from John Snavely, his successor, to be paid by said Smuller on the Chamberlain note,” $3290.79, all of which he paid except the sum of $427.67. Standing in such a position, he is precluded from using the fund for his own benefit. His receipt of the money for the defined use amounts to an agreement not to apply it to any other, and of course not to his own use by pleading a set-off. This was ruled in United States Bank <em>v. </em>McCallister, 9 Barr 475. There funds had been deposited in the bank for a special purpose, with notice of the purpose for which they were designed. It was held that the bank, could not refuse to apply them to the object for which they were deposited, on the ground that a debt was due from the depositor. There is no distinction to be made between the principle of that case and the present. This disposes of the <a id="p71" href="#p71" data-label="71" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*71</a>whole matter, and it would he improper for us to express an opinion relative to the effect of the mortgage and assignment upon the rights of the plaintiff in error.</p>
