This proceeding was commenced by the president of the road filing a petition, stating that the road was located over the plaintiff’s land, and praying for the appointment of viewers to assess the damages which he might sustain. The report of the viewers was filed September 9th 1859, awarding $&gt;805 to the plaintiff in error, and along with the report a plot showing the location of the road over the plaintiff’s land on the northern side of the plank-road, taking a strip of land 66 feet wide and 2050 feet long, and leaving at the end nearest Pittsburgh a narrow strip 25 feet wide at one end, and decreasing to nothing at a point 1000 feet from the lower end of his place, between the railroad and the plank-road.</p>

If they could not agree upon appraisers, the act authorized the Courts of Common Pleas to appoint six disinterested men, and made it the duty of those men to examine and survey the said lands, tenements, or hereditaments, and estimate the injury or damage, if any, .that, in their apprehension, will be sustained, as aforesaid, by reason of said road. They are also required, in estimating such injury and damage, to take into consideration the advantages that will be derived to the owner or owners of said land from the said railroad, and an appeal from their assessment is allowed to the court. The act makes no farther specification of the damages which the company is required to pay. It does not, as do many of the acts incorporating railroad companies, directly require that in the assessment of damages, the “ disadvantages” or “ inconveniences” which may be likely to result from the railroad, shall be taken into consideration. It would be a narrow construction, however, were we to hold that the legislature did not intend an assessment of all the damages, which are the direct and immediate consequence of the construction of the railroad to the whole tract of land through which it may pass. It is upon the whole tract that the road is located, though only a part is actually occupied. The injury is therefore done to the tract as a whole, of whatever components that injury may consist. The exclusive appropriation of a part, the inconvenience arising from division, or from increased difficulty of access, and the cost of additional necessary fencing, are alike the direct and immediate result of the construction of the railroad. Nothing can be recovered for anything which is not groundwork for damages at common law; but the construction which has been given to the legislative charters for improvement companies generally, has been that they are intended to secure compensation for all such injuries as the common law recognises as fit subjects for compensation. And this has been held, notwithstanding considerable differences in the language employed by the legislature: 3 Casey 99.</p>

The plaintiff was permitted to show everything that could be legitimately taken into consideration by the jury in estimating the damages. Even the mode of measuring them, for which he contended, was accorded to him by the court. He was allowed the benefit of the rule <a id="p481" href="#p481" data-label="481" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*481</a>laid down in Schuylkill Nav. Co. <em>v. </em>Thoburn, 7 S. &amp; R. 411, that the true measure of compensation is the difference between what the whole property would have sold for, unaffected by the railroad, and what it would have sold for as affected by it. Nor was the advantage of this rule in any degree taken from him by the rejection of the evidence which he offered. His attempted <em>mode </em>of proof of the difference between the two values, was entirely inadmissible; and here was the reason for the rejection of his evidence. His offers all had the same fault. They proposed to submit to the jury the conjecture of the witnesses as to what the plaintiff’s lands would be worth, or what their market value would be at some unknown future time, when the railroad shall have been constructed. Such testimony does not rise even to the standard of an opinion. It is a mere guess, with no substantial foundation upon which to rest. When damages are assessed after the completion of a railroad, it is possible to prove, with some reliable certainty, the difference in the market value of the land through which it passes, caused by its construction. Then the value at the time of the entry on the land is known, and so is its value as affected by the improvement. In a certain sense, indeed, an estimate of present or past value is an opinion, but it has a measure which insures proximate accuracy. An estimate of what property will be worth at a future day, or in an altered condition, is entirely without guide or measure, and must be wholly fanciful. And the proffered evidence was objectionable for other reasons. It proposed to prove that, by reason of the entry on the land, and occupation of a part, and by reason of the railroad, the property would be depreciated in value, without confining the witnesses to a consideration of the direct and necessary consequences of such occupation. It left them at liberty to take into their estimate any consequences, no matter how remote, without regard to the question whether they were such damages as the law allows to be compensated. This ought not to have been permitted.</p>
