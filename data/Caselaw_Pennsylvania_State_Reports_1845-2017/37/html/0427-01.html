On this subject the jury will take the deed, and consider the fact that he had conveyed himself to Greer, and also his acts and declarations recognising the right of Greer, and also the evidence that he claimed it himself. All the evidence on the subject, of the manner in which he and the plaintiff held, will be considered.

The judge’s language was <em>: </em>— “ This actual possession of the surface carries with it the actual possession downward perpendicularly through all the various strata. The actual possession, therefore, was in the plaintiff.”</p>

But it is not true that after such a severance, whether by reservation or grant, the possession of the surface -is possession of the underlying mineral. That mines may form a distinct possession, and a different inheritance from the surface-land, has been long settled in England, as may be seen by reference to the cases cited in the two opinions heretofore delivered in this case, and <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>reported in 7th Casey 476 and 482.

    <p id="b431-6" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[172,484,1164,1031]]]'>It is a common occurrence in mining districts there, not only that the ownership of the soil is vested in one person, and that of the mines in another, hut there are frequently distinct ownerships of the minerals in the same land. Thus, one person may he entitled to the iron-ore, another to the limestone; a third to one seam or stratum of coal, and a fourth to a distinct stratum. Title to any of these minerals, quite distinct from the titlé to the surface, may he shown hy documentary evidence, — or, in the absence of such evidence, or in opposition to it, title to them may be made out hy proof of possession and acts of ownership under the statute of limitations. The acts of ownership, however, which constitute possession and confer title, must be distinct from such as are exercised over the surface: Tymnith <em>v. </em>Wynne, 2 Barn. &amp; Ald. 554; Cullen <em>v. </em>Rich, Bull. N. P. 102. And see the same case under the name Rich <em>v. </em>Johnson, 2 Strange 1142. So entirely is a mineral-right, after severance, a claim to <em>land, </em>and therefore not an incorporeal hereditament, that title to it cannot he acquired by prescription. Prescription lies only for incorporeal rights, not for land. It may confer a right to work a particular mine, as it may confer a right of way across another’s estate, or a right to fish in another’s waters; hut the title to the mine itself, like title to land, must he made out hy documentary evidence, or under the statute of limitations: Wilkinson <em>v. </em>Proud, 11 M. &amp; W. 33, and the cases therein cited.</p>

But now, by statute 8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 106, all corporeal hereditaments are declared, as regards the conveyance of the immediate freehold, to lie in grant as well as in livery. And from Chatham <em>v. </em>Williamson, 4 East 476, and Wilkinson <em>v. </em>Proud, above cited, it would seem that the law was so even before the statute was passed.</p>

There is no more reason why mines in another’s land, whether opened or unopened, may not he held by a deed duly acknowledged and recorded, than why land in its most ordinary signification may not he so held.

It was then held that the deed was not a license but a conveyance of the fee of the mine — that it <a id="p432" href="#p432" data-label="432" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*432</a>was a grant of land and not of an incorporeal hereditament. That ruling is not questioned in the present case, and it is decisive against the plaintiff’s action so far as it is founded on a possession of the surface. For no length of possession of the surface merely could divest the title granted by that deed. Adverse possession of the mine by the owners of the surface, for the statory period, would avail as title, but the case was not ruled below on this ground, and therefore we do not consider whether the evidence made out such a possession in the plaintiff and those under whom he claims. On the ground assumed, that possession of the surface for more than twenty-one years was title to the mine, the court was clearly in error.</p>
