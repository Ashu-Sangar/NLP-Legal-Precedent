Catharine left no child living at her death, but left five grandchildren, the childi-en of a daughter who had died before her.

The case was this: — Henry Soonover, deceased, by his will dated 20th April 1809, and proved January 22d 1812, devised all his real estate, wheresover the same may be, equally to be divided between his two daughters Catharine Livingood and Dorothea Miller, during their natural lives respectively. The moiety of the real estate so devised to his daughter Catharine, he gave to <em>such children </em>as she may leave <em>living </em>at the time of her death, and to their heirs and assigns for ever ; and the moiety so devised to Dorothea Miller, he also gave to <em>such children </em>as she may leave <em>living </em>at the time of her death, and to their heirs and assigns. The testator further directed if either Catharine or Dorothea should die <em>without </em>leaving issue <em>living </em>at the time of her death, then the <em>survivor </em>should have the share of the daughter so dying during her natural life, <em>“ </em>and the <em>children </em>of the said <em>survivor </em>which she might leave <em>living </em>at the time of her death, shall hold the <em>whole </em>of his real estate from the death of their mother for ever, to them, their heirs and assigns.” The plaintiffs below proved that Catharine Livingood left <em>no child living </em>at her death; but that she was married to John Livingood on the 17th of April 1798, and gave birth to a daughter, March 24th 1799, who <em>died </em>4th of October 1824, leaving five children, the plaintiffs below, and that Catharine Livingood died November 27th 1851. <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>It was also admitted by the plaintiffs below that Dorothea Miller died before her sister, <em>leaving children surviving </em>her, whose interest came by deed, to Andrew Lantz, Sr., deceased, the ancestor of the defendants below. The defendants below gave in evidence a deed from John Livingood and wife for the land in dispute, to Thomas Stephens and his heirs, and the deed of Thomas Stephens and wife for the same land to Andrew Lantz, deceased, and his heirs. The defendants in error claimed that Catharine and Dorothea, the two daughters, took life estates under the will of Henry Soonover, deceased, with alternate contingent remainders to their issue living, at their respective deaths, and that they are the issue of the said Catharine. The plaintiffs in error claimed that upon the death of Catharine Livingood <em>without leaving a child living </em>at her death, by the will of Henry Soonover, deceased, the whole estate passed to Dorothea Miller during her natural life, and at her death to such children as she left <em>living, </em>and it being admitted, that Dorothea left <em>children living </em>at her death; and having been proved that Catharine died without leaving a child living at her death, and the plaintiffs in error having the deed of the children of Dorothea Miller to their deceased ancestor, they are the lawful owners of the land in dispute.</p>

What then did their children take ? Very evidently, vested remainders in fee, conditioned on their surviving their mothers, or leaving issue surviving them; for the rules of law require a vesting so soon as there is any one in existence that can take. And the estate having become vested, will not be defeated upon any doubtful implication or condition; and all the evidence in the will and in the nature of the case is against declaring it defeated in this instance. True, the devise is to such “ children” as his daughter should have living at her death, and to their heirs; but this is explained by the alternative devise over if she should die without leaving “issue” living at her death; and grandchildren are issue and may take. This interpretation is so accordant with our law of descents and custom of devising, that we cannot avoid adopting it. There can be no fair pretence that the plaintiffs are estopped by the deed of their grandparents from making this claim.</p>
