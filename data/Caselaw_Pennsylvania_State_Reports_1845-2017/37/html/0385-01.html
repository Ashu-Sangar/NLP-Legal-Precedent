An arrangement of this kind had been made, which was revoked by the school board in June 1859. After repeated efforts to procure the consent of the school boards of Franklin and Washington school districts to this arrangement, pending which the case was submitted to the state superintendent, and which terminated in the refusal of the Franklin board to renew the arrangement; this application was made to the court, as above stated. A rule was granted on the board of directors to show cause, &amp;c., who filed an answer, in which they set forth at length their reasons for not complying with the wish of the petitioners; to which the petitioners replied, giving their reasons why their request should have been granted by the board. It was not denied by the board, that the schoolhouse in Washington was nearer to the most distant of the petitioners by more than half a mile than the Franklin school-house; nor that in point of safety and facility of access, the former was more convenient to them than the latter: but their refusal was put upon the ground that the petitioners were sufficiently accommodated by the present arrangement; that the change required <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>would be a pecuniary injury to Franklin district; that, if made, district No. 1 in Franklin would have to be abandoned; that the distance and difficulty of access were not so great as to require it; and that the point had been decided by the state superintendent, to whom it had been regularly submitted, under the 46th section of the school law of 1854.</p>

Whether the distance’ or difficulty of access is to be regarded as great or not, depends much upon circumstances, — such as the age of the children, the density of the population, and the customs of the locality, and therefore must be left, in a great degree, to the discretion of the directors; and, of course, their abuse of this discretion must be very clear before they can be adjudged guilty of official misconduct. We must be liberal and generous towards this discretion, in reviewing the exercise of it; for a strict and jealous supervision would be fatal to the discretion itself. We must not interpret the law so as to keep the directors in per<a id="p387" href="#p387" data-label="387" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*387</a>petual fear of the courts, nor so as to set them to guard against this law, <em>by </em>so arranging their school-houses around the district, that few or none can have a chance of claiming that any school of an adjoining district is more convenient.</p>
