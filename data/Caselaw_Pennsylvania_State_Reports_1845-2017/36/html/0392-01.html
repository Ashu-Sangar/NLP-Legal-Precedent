On the trial, the plaintiff offered to prove that this deed was obtained by fraud and deceit; and that Conrad M. Hicks, the acting party, had declared at different times, both before and after, and on the day, and at the time, it was executed, that he was getting the coal only. To the admission of this evidence the defendants objected, on the ground that the plaintiff was estopped from contesting the validity of the deed, by the proceedings in the equity suit. The court below sustained the objection, ruled out the evidence, and the plaintiff excepted.</p>

It is true, they were sued out by his counsel; but the remedy was mistaken, the common law affording ample remedy, and there was no necessity for a proceeding in equity. There was no decree as contemplated by law. The court did not make a decree upon the bill filed, but submitted the facts to a jury, and after a finding by them, judgment was taken in the usual way, as in other actions at law. This is one of the cases which did not require equity proceedings, as every point in it could be decided in an action of trespass.</p>

It is against the policy of the law to encourage fraud and dishonesty. The plaintiff’s farm was worth thousands before this deed was made; since, it is not worth as many hundreds; and all this by reason of the fraud perpetrated upon the plaintiff at the execution of the deed. He was told that he was only selling the coal and iron ore, with the right to mine, &amp;c. Sometime after the deed was executed and delivered, he was informed that all the limestone was included, <a id="p394" href="#p394" data-label="394" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*394</a>which is more valuable than the coal and iron ore combined. The plaintiff is a very ignorant man, unable to read or write, and made his mark to the signature of the deed.</p>

    <p id="b394-7" data-blocks='[["BL_394.7",394,[315,816,1154,299]]]'>The plaintiff is not prejudiced by the result of that suit. He lost nothing, for the plaintiff paid the costs of trial.

A verdict and judgment between the same parties, or their privies, on the same subject-matter, though in a different form of action, is admissible and conclusive: Marsh <em>v. </em>Pier, <a href="/rawle/4/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Rawle 273" data-case-ids="1823537" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0273-01">4 <em>Rawle </em>273</a>, 287; Calhoun <em>v. </em>Dunning, <a href="/us/4/0120-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Dall. 120" data-case-ids="581129" data-case-paths="/us/4/0120-01">4 <em>Dall. </em>120</a>; Hess <em>v. </em>Heeble, 4 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>246; Kean <em>v. </em>McKinsey, 2 <em>Barr </em>31; Bratton <em>v. </em>Mitchell, 3 <em>Barr 49; </em>Man <em>v. </em>Drexel, 2 <em>Barr </em>210. And whether it was a verdict of a Court of Common Pleas; or a decree of a -Court of Chancery, under our Pennsylvania practice, is wholly immaterial; for the decree of a Court of Chancery on the same subject-matter, under the same limitations, is as conclusive as a judgment of a court of record: Evans <em>v. </em>Tatem, 9 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>252; Owens <em>v. </em>Dawson, <a href="/watts/1/0149-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Watts 149" data-case-ids="1838064" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0149-01">1 <em>Watts </em>149</a>.</p>

But there was no final decree. An issue was sent to a jury to find for the information of the conscience of the court, whether the deed had been obtained by fraud, and their verdict was that it had not. There the matter rested. Of course, this constituted no estoppel of record. It is the judgment or decree of the court which concludes, not the verdict of a jury. The Common Pleas were not themselves bound by the verdict. They might have sent an issue to <a id="p395" href="#p395" data-label="395" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*395</a>another jury to try the same facts, or have disregarded the verdict entirely.
