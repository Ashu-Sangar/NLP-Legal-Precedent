Holcomb, Esq., a justice of the peace in the borough of Carlisle, to recover fees from the county for committing vagrants to the county jail. The bill claimed runs from the 21st January to the 22d April 1859, during which time <em>195 </em>commitments were made, and the justice claims a fee of 87£ <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>cents on each commitment. If he is entitled to recover anything from the county, the commissioners are willing to allow fifty cents on each commitment, and there is nothing, in the fee-bill that would give him more. The items in the fee-bill, in Commonwealth cases, applicable to the plaintiff’s claim, are, docket entry ten cents, <em>mittimus </em>twenty-five cents, administering oath three cents, recording conviction, for every ten words, one cent. No records of conviction have been exhibited, but if the record contained one hundred words, which we think would be a large estimate, it would be ten cents additional, making in all forty-eight cents. There is a further item of one cent for every ten words of information ■ or complaint on behalf of the Commonwealth, but it does not appear that any information was made or warrant of arrest issued in any of the cases claimed. Of the 195fecommitments, 77 were made on the justice’s own view, and the residue in cases where defendants were brought before him by our constables and the sheriff.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b351-7" data-blocks='[["BL_351.7",351,[212,1301,1163,851]]]'>“1. We are clearly of opinion that the commitments were not in proper form. The Act of Assembly of 1767 directs justices, upon conviction of vagrants, <em>‘ </em>to commit them to the workhouse or jail of the county, there to be kept at hard labour, during a term not exceeding thirty days.’ The commitments in these cases direct the constable to convey the body of the defendant, charged before the justice with being an idle person and a vagrant, to the keeper of the county jail, and require the keeper to receive the defendant into his custody, in the said common jail, and him there safely keep for the number of days for which each defendant is committed. It omits the requirement of the act that the defendant is to be kept at hard labour. But will this omission deprive the justice of his fees for the services performed? We think not. The commitment would certainly justify the sheriff in receiving and detaining the defendant, and we see no reason why the error or omission in the commitment should deprive the justice of his legal fees, other than an error in a judgment in a civil case, afterwards reversed on a certiorari, or a different judgment entered upon an appeal. We answer this point in the negative.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b351-8" data-blocks='[["BL_351.8",351,[219,2162,1156,170]]]'>“2. We answer this in the negative.

Rut this ought to be satisfactorily proved. The presumption of law is, that a public officer discharges his duty honestly, until the contrary is proved.</p>

      <em>“4. We </em>cannot instruct you as requested in this point. The form of commitment, although erroneous, ought not to deprive the plaintiff of his fees. And there may be cases where a justice would be entirely justified in committing a poor unfortunate creature as a vagrant, at his own request. If a poor, miserable, dirty, ragged, filthy, lousy creature, whom no man could be induced, for money, to take into his house, although he might be, by feelings of sympathy and commiseration, should apply to a justice for a commitment to keep him from starvation, or freezing.by exposure to the inclemencies of a cold night, no one would censure a public officer for preventing him from perishing in such a case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b352-7" data-blocks='[["BL_352.7",352,[300,1241,1157,377]]]'>“ The grand criterion which ought to govern in cases of this kind is, the motive which induced the action. If a public officer is influenced by proper motives, and acts conscientiously in the discharge of his public duties, and so as in his judgment to promote the public welfare and security, and for the good of his fellow-man, he ought to be paid for his services by the public to whom those services are rendered, although he may err in his judgment. No man ought to suffer for an honest error of judgment.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b352-8" data-blocks='[["BL_352.8",352,[300,1629,1159,297]]]'>“ If, on the contrary, he is influenced by no such motives, but is governed in his* official acts by his own interests and the love of gain, and prostitutes his office for the acquisition of money at the public expense, irrespective of the public good, then he ought not to be permitted to pervert this office from its proper functions of subserving the public welfare, to promote his private good at the public expense.</p>

What were the motives which governed the plaintiff in committing the 195- vagrants, for which he claims to be paid by the county ? Was he influenced by proper motives, and a conscientious discharge of his official duties ? If he was, and such is the legal presumption, unless the evidence satisfies you to the contrary, he ought to be paid, although he may have erred in his judgment, and committed persons who did not come within the provisions of the act respecting vagrants.</p>

Of the 195 commitments, 118 were arrested and brought before him by our constables and sheriff and his deputies; for these he certainly ought to be paid. Of the 77 committed -on his own view, we submit to you to determine whether he ought to be paid for all, for any, or for how many. If they were vagrants within the meaning of the act, we have said to you, the plaintiff ought to be paid.
