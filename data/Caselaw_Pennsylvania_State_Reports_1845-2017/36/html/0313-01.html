The lands of these parties, at one time, were owned by David Fullerton, and when he sold by deed to Philip Snyder, under whom the plaintiff holds, in 1808, the right to this tail-race was reserved. In the agreement produced, endorsed on the deed referred to, Snyder declares that, before the execution and delivery of the deed, it had been agreed between the parties thereto, <em>‘ </em>that David Fullerton, his heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, shall have and enjoy the free use and privilege now enjoyed of the ground through which the water passes, through from the tail-race of his, the said David Fullerton’s mill, so far as the same extends through the premises as above conveyed to the said Philip Snyder.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b314-9" data-blocks='[["BL_314.9",314,[313,1676,1147,469]]]'>“ The title to the mill property is now vested in the defendant, and he alleges that he and those under whom he claims, have had <em>the' </em>free use and privilege’ of the tail-race from the date of the deed to the present, and that the owners of the mill have entered upon the land, over which it runs, from time to time, with harrows, ploughs, and horses, for the purpose of cleaning the race, whenever it suited their purpose.. Under this agreement, the defendant had an undoubted right to enter through and upon the plaintiff’s land ‘ to remove obstructions from natural and artificial causes’ in the race, whenever it became necessary, as he and those under whom he claims have enjoyed the right'for the last twenty-one years.</p>

It seems, that this gate was put up in 1848, and that before that time there was a fence of poles at that point, and that both formed part of the enclosure to the meadow.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b315-6" data-blocks='[["BL_315.6",315,[175,556,1152,1154]]]'>“ The defendant does not deny having taken away the gate, and we instruct you that, under the agreement, he had the right to take it down, to enable him to clean the race, as was the custom of the owners of the mill. But in doing so, he was bound to respect the rights of the owner of the soil, doing as little injury as possible, and using the land no further than was necessary to the full enjoyment of the right. He alleges that it was necessary to remove the gate, so that the horses, ploughs, and harrows might pass up and down the body of the race, and this seems to be admitted; but was it necessary also, that the gate should be kept away? This is not pretended;' but the defendant says it was not his business to restore it again to its former position. The defendant had the right, under the grant, to enter upon the lands of the plaintiff, at any point that might be deemed necessary to reach the race. Suppose he had made his entry at the bars, about which there was some parol agreement; or through the fence by laying it down, was he bound to close up the opening again ? If he was not, it was in his power to make a common of the plaintiff’s meadow, for his own and other people’s swine and cattle. It will scarcely be pretended that this was a part of his privileges; the gate was only part of the enclosure, and the obligation to close it was as imperative as to close the fence at any other point. If the gate had obstructed the free flow of the water, this would have constituted a sufficient justification for the removal; but this is not alleged. It was, therefore, the duty of the defendant to restore the gate when he finished cleaning the race; any other rule would place the plaintiff’s meadow at the defendant’s mercy.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b315-7" data-blocks='[["BL_315.7",315,[176,1708,1151,641]]]'>“But the question is, can the plaintiff recover in this form of action ? The defendant says he cannot, because he was authorized, under the grant, to enter; and that having entered by license, he cannot be held for consequential damages, in an action of trespass <em>quare clausum fregit. </em>That if the plaintiff has a right of action, it should have been case. We have already said that the defendant had the right of entry, and there can be no recovery here, unless he exceeded the license, or abused his authority. If he did, he must be treated as if he had entered without license. If the defendant took down the gate, and refused or neglected to restore it to -its place again, after the necessity for its removal was gone, and his swine entered the meadow at that point, and committed the injuries complained of, then he did abuse his authority, and the plaintiff is entitled to recover. The jury will estimate the damages.”</p>
