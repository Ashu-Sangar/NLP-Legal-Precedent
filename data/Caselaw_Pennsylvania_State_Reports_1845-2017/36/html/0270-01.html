But, although the hill alleges something of the kind, the answer denies it; and that which the answer does-admit, does not amount to a formal and legal demand. A demand' to have money paid her on account of dower, before assignment thereof, in any way, or by any process whatever, is not a demand to have her dower assigned. It is a claim for that which follows, as a right for the performance of a previous act upon which it arises and depends, not for the performance of the act itself. Peradventure, when her dower came to be assigned, it might have-been set out to her by metes and bounds, in which case she would have entered and taken the profits, and would have had no claim for mo.ney in lieu of profits; or the <em>terre tenant </em>might have given her the third of the crops. And as to her renunciation in the Orphans’ Court, the effect of that was only to place her, in regard to her right of dower, where she would have been, if there had been no will; but was in no sense, a demand pursuant to that right, to have a distinct specific act, viz., the assignment of her dower, done. So far as that goes, then, she has advanced no <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>further in and towards the ascertainment of her dower, than if her husband had died intestate.

It is to be observed, however, in' relation to that case, that the learned judge is speaking of a case where the enjoyment of her dower by the widow is prevented by the wrongful act or deforcement of the heir or feoffee. This case is free from that feature; for it does not appear that the defendant, or any one else on his behalf, ever refused to assign it, Avhen called on, of interposed any obstacle or objection to her ascertainment and enjoyment of her right.

It is a general principle, applicable to all equity jurisdictions, that where the law gives neither right nor remedy, equity cannot assist.

This is the only case in which the English chancery will interpose in behalf of the personal representative; and the case of Conklin <em>v. </em>Bush is express, that equity will only interfere in the same cases and upon the like conditions which would warrant the aid of a court of chancery in England; and that that is the true meaning and extent of the case of Sandhack <em>v. </em>Quigley. But where the demandant dies pending the action of dower, and before judgment, it is said, in both the cases last referred to, that the action is at an end, and cannot afterwards be sustained in any form. <em>A fortiori </em>is this the result, where she dies before claim made or action brought. The reason is manifest. The action of dower can be. no further proceeded with, because its object is to put the widow into possession of the third part of her husband’s lands, which, by her death, is made impossible; and her right so to be put in possession, not having been determined by the legal judgment of any tribunal, <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>there is nothing to sustain the claim for damages under the statute, so as to transmit it, by survivorship, to the personal representative.</p>

Thus, if the jury omit to find that the husband died seised, because the statute only gives damages in such cases prior to demand; or if no demand has been made by her, for the heir is not bound to assign this provision till demanded, because the law casts the freehold of the whole upon him, which he cannot divide without the concurrence of the wife; or, if the heir or feoffee assign dower, and the wife accepteth thereof, because, having her dower, which <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>is the principal, she cannot sue for the damages, which are but consequential or accessory; or, if <em>tout tem prist </em>be pleaded, and it is-found'for the tenant; or perhaps (although that is not so clear) if the statute of limitations intervene: 2 <em>Bac. Abr. </em>DoWer 149. Thus .understood, there is no difficulty in reconciling what is said by Mr. Story, with the doctrine of our own courts on the subject. ■</p>

That section authorizes executors and administrators to commence and prosecute all personal actions which the decedent, whom they represent, might have commenced or prosecuted, except actions for slander, libel, and wrongs done to the person. The commissioners to revise the civil code, by whom the Act of 1834 was reported, say that it was their intention to place <em>all other, </em>actions upon the same footing, both as to the right and the form of action, after the death of the party as before. As far as the <em>surviving </em>of the action, then, is concerned, the plaintiffs are not precluded of their remedy by the death of their decedent; and yet it is recognised as clear law, both in Sandback <em>v. </em>Quigley, and Conklin <em>v. </em>Bush, that by the death of the widow before judgment of seisin in an action of dower, or decree in a court of equity, the personal representatives can enforce no remedy for damages byway of arrears, either at law or in equity. This is, manifestly, on the ground that the legal right and remedy were gone at the time of the filing of the bill; that at that stage of the proceedings, and in that relation of the parties, there was no right of action at all, even in the decedent; and, of course^ there is nothing for the statute to transmit to the executors or -administrators. Be the reason what it may, both cases are clear and decisive, that the legal remedy is gone; and I have already sufficiently discussed the conditions under which equity will then interpose.</p>

They themselves- allege a forfeiture of all pretensions to dower; for it needs no words to show that such a composition agreement as is alleged by them, would be fatal to any claim for dower, or arrears of dower, and that their remedy would be only on the agreement itself.</p>

They allege a contract, and introduce the original right of. dower, and demand, such as it was, made under it, to show the. inducement and consideration of the contract. There is a prayer for special relief, to wit, a decree for specific performance; and the usual <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>prayer for general relief. To make a decree, under the general prayer, for the payment of the arrears of dower, would be inconsistent with the special relief asked, as well as with the case made by the bill. But this cannot be done consistently with the rules of equity practice. In 1 <em>Daniel’s Oh. Dr. </em>490, the rule on this subject is thus stated: ‘Although where the prayer does not extend to embrace all the relief to which the plaintiff may at the hearing show a right, the deficient relief may be • supplied under the general prayer, yet such relief must be consistent with that specifically prayed, as well as with the case made by the bill; for the court will not suffer a defendant to be taken by surprise, and permit a plaintiff to neglect and pass over the prayer he has made, and take another decree, even "though it be according to the case made by his bill.’ And therefore, in Williams <em>v. </em>Shaw, 3 <em>Buss. </em>178 n., as the case is stated by Daniel <em>(ubi supra), </em>wliere a vendor filed a bill for specific performance against a purchaser who had been in possession under the contract for several years, but failed in establishing his right to specific execution, by reason of a defect in his title, the court refused, under the prayer for general relief, to direct an account of the rents and.profits against the purchaser, although he had stated, by his answer, that he was willing to pay a fair rent. And so, in Legal <em>v. </em>Miller, 2 <em>Ves. Sr. </em>299, where a bill was filed for the specific performance of a written agreement, and parol evidence was read to prove a variation from it, the bill was dismissed with costs, the plaintiff not being allowed to resort to the substantial agreement, proved on the part of the defendant. And, in Grimes <em>v. </em>French, 2 <em>Ath. </em>141, where a bill was brought for an annuity or rent-charge under a will, Lord Chancellor Hardwicke would not permit the plaintiff’s counsel, on the hearing, to drop the demand for the annuity, and insist upon the land itself.

The allegations so relied on must not only be such as to afford a ground for the relief sought, but they must have been introduced into the bill for the purpose of showing a claim to relief, and not for the mere purpose of corroborating the plaintiff’s right to the specific relief prayed for: 1 <em>Daniel’s Oh.

Joseph Paul, by his will, devised this farm to his nephew, Joshua P. Lloyd, on condition that he changed his name to Joseph Paul, charged with an annuity of $200 in favour of his widow. The testator died on the 80th November 1857, leaving his widow and two nephews surviving him, and on the 10th March 1858, the widow filed, in the Orphans’ Court of Bucks county, her written election not to accept of the provisions made in her behalf in the will of her husband.</p>

That court has been more liberal to the widow, from the consideration, that the profits of a third part of her husband’s real estate, are her only subsistence, from his death.

In addition to this, it may be remarked, that the tenant may probably be considered in equity, as holding the widow’s one-third of .the estate, as her trustee or bailiff, from the death of her husband, and therefore answerable to her for his receipt of rents, in respect of that proportion of the property.’ ” This appears to be the correct view of the widow’s rights, and is sustained by the tenor of the decisions. The cases of Hamilton <em>v. </em>Mohun, <em>1 P. Wms. </em>122, and of Graham <em>v. </em>Graham, 1 <em>Ves. Sen. </em>262, proceeded upon this principle, in allowing the widow in account, her third of the <em>mesne </em>profits, although there had been no assignment of dower. Bright says, p. 427, “ The circumstance of an assignment of dower not having been made prior to the widow’s death, will not deprive her representative of <em>mesne </em>profits, nor prevent her right, whilst living, to obtain payment by them in equity.” And in the note to 1 <em>Ponblanque’s Equity </em>22, it is said: “ And though- the widow should die before she estab<a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>listed her right to dower, equity will, in favour of her personal representatives, decree on account of the rents and profits of the lands, of which she afterwards appeared dowable.”</p>

As our courts are clothed with full equity powers, in regard to dower, there can be little doubt that as soon as this simple mode of proceeding is understood, the action of dower will fall into similar disuse here.</p>

The case of Conklin <em>v. </em>Bush, 8 <em>Barr </em>514, where this opinion of Judge Rogers, in its full extent, is doubted by Judge Coulter, does not apply to the case now before the court,, because here the husband died seised. “ It is true,” says Judge Coulter, 517, <em>“ </em>that in equity, by proceedings in chancery, the administrator can recover <em>mesne </em>damages for the detention of dower.
