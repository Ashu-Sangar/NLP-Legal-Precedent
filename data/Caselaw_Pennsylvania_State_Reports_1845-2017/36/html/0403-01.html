The plaintiffs purchased a horse from the defendants for $132.50, and in the course of the negotiation, the evidence shows-that Burgey remarked to Cochran Thompson, from whom the horse-was purchased, ‘ I suppose the horse is all right;’ to which Thompson replied, ‘ So far as I know; here is a buggy, hitch him up and try him..’ The evidence further shows, that the horse was a wind-sucker or crib-biter, and the defendants knew that fact. The plaintiffs contend, that this vice or practice rendered the horse less valuable than if he had been all right, and claim to recover the difference between the value of this horse as he was, and what would have been his value if he had not been addicted to this habit, but in the language of the witness ‘all right.’ If the defendant concealed from the plaintiff a known and latent vice or habit, which the plaintiff had not the opportunity of discovering before he made the purchase, and which detracted from the value of the horse, then the plaintiff would be entitled to recover damages; and the proper measure of damages would be the difference between the value of this horse addicted to the habit of wind-sucking, and his value if he had l?een free from such habit. "When a deceit has <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>been practised, the person injured may proceed in two modes. He may offer to return the property and rescind the contract, and if the offer is accepted, it terminates the transaction. If not accepted, the injured party may bring his action, and recover in damages for the injury sustained.”</p>

We are fully aware, that it is well settled, that the difference of value between the article in a sound or unsound state is the measure of damages for a <em>breach of a warranty, </em>without regard to the price given; it is so ruled in Cothers <em>v. </em>Keever, 4 <em>Barr </em>168, but this ruling applies solely to the form of action <em>ex contractu, </em>and has never been carried to actions of the contrary character. There is no decision <em>to </em>that effect in Pennsylvania, and for a very substantial reason, as we can readily conceive ; when A. warrants an article to B., the latter may justly claim, if damages are sustained, and allege that he relied upon his warranty; and that having purchased on the faith of the warranty,- and being entitled to all the profit he reasonably could have made, and the warranty having failed, it matters not what price he paid; he bought the article as a sound one. But where there is no warranty, and the party purchases on the naked declarations of the vendor accompanied with his own examination, and finds himself deceived, should he recover more than his actual loss, and ought the court to reject evidence which would show that the plaintiff absolutely sustained no loss — that the article was really and substantially worth more than he paid for it ? In all cases where a party sets up a claim for damages, he ought to show and prove a loss; and to deny to the other party an opportunity of rebutting such evidence, if offered, is simply to afford a premium for this form of litigation. Take the case now before us. The plaintiffs below buy from the defendants below a horse for the sum of $132.50; there is no warranty, no agreement or promise of warranty, but the plaintiffs take him away and afterwards bring suit for a deceit practised on them. In the court below, the defendants offer to show by respectable witnesses, <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>who had known the horse from the time he was colted, that on the very day he was sold he was in fact worth more than $132.50, the price paid for him, they knowing him to have been a cribber. This offer the court reject. The plaintiffs below,, however, have sold the horse in one of the Eastern markets, and beyond all doubt made money out of him; for the evidence is, they have never yet divulged to any mortal the price they received on his resale.</p>
    <p id="b405-6" data-blocks='[["BL_405.6",405,[193,753,1154,216]]]'>Whaf did Cochran Thompson mean when he said “ the horse is all right,” the words in which the alleged deceit is predicated?
