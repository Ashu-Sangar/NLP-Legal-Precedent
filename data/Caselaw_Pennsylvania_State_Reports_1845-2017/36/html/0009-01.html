Reviewers were appointed at the March Sessions to report to June Sessions. They filed a report before the March Sessions terminated, but it could not be made to the court until the sessions next following. On the 15th of May, during the continuance of the court, at which the reviewers were appointed, the court rescinded their appointment, for good reasons, and appointed others. This was entirely proper and regular. So was it to set aside the report which they had filed, for they were not authorized to make a report until the next succeeding sessions. Having set aside the reviewers, and their untimely report, the appointment of other reviewers on the petition for a review was in strict accordance jvith the Act of Assembly.</p>
