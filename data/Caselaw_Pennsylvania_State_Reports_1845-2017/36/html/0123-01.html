The original defendant, Hughes, might perhaps have objected to the execution in its then form, but it is not available in the present case to the party now maldng the objection.</p>

This writ is then to be regarded as without any formal return by the sheriff, but if a sale was made under it, for the purposes of the present case, it may be otherwise proved. Had the sheriff made return that he had sold the property to Emley, this would have made a <em>primé facie </em>case; but not having done so, the bid or purchase and striking down the property may be proved as any other contract. By such striking down the property, the purchaser becomes liable, unless he establish a satisfactory defence. It is contended, that this fact is not proved by Mr. Harvey, and we submit the evidence to you. If you find that at the sale by the sheriff, made under this <em>venditioni exponas, </em>the property was bid off by the defendant, and it was struck down to him, the sheriff in this suit may recover the amount of the bid, with interest thereon, for the benefit of the judgment-creditors of Hughes. Whether the plaintiff has established this alleged bid and purchase and amount or price, are matters of fact for you.”</p>

The admission in evidence of the <em>fieri facias </em>and inquisition: 2. The charge of the court that the sheriff’s sale might be otherwise proved, than by the production of a formal return to the writ of <em>venditioni exponas.</em>

The defendant in that judgment <a id="p125" href="#p125" data-label="125" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*125</a>neither complained of it, nor objected to it, nor to the executions nor to the sales under them.</p>
    <p id="b125-6" data-blocks='[["BL_125.6",125,[189,477,1160,933]]]'>With regard to the second error assigned,' we think that the court erred in saying there was no formal return to the <em>venditioni exponas </em>by the sheriff, it appearing that there was a return signed “A. Drum, sheriff, by H. Stark, deputy,” and Mr. Stark having been proved to he the sheriff’s general deputy; and this, under the decisions, we think to have been a sufficient signature of the sheriff: Dewar <em>v. </em>Spence, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Whart.%20220" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Whart. 220">2 <em>Wh. </em>220</a>; Rudy <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 11 <em>Casey </em>166. This was undoubtedly the practice during the whole of sheriff Drum’s term, and I am informed there is a similar practice in some other of the northern counties. .The return is formal, if in the name of the sheriff, and signed by his authorized deputy, whose acts in such a case are his acts. “ The return,” says Watson on Sheriffs, p. 67, 7 <em>Law </em>Library, “is made by the under-sheriff, in the name of the high sheriff, as the high sheriff is the person to make the return.” ■ “ If the sheriff die during his year of office, the 'under-sheriff, before the appointment of a new sheriff, should make the return in the name of the deceased sheriff.” See <em>Appendix </em>351. If, therefore, the return objected to by the defendant had been admitted, as it should' have been, the whole of the second error would have fallen to the ground. A new trial, therefore, could not benefit the defendant, as the result must of course be the same.</p>
    <p id="b125-7" data-blocks='[["BL_125.7",125,[184,1421,1162,386]]]'>But it is certainly not error to say, “ that if a sale is duly made for the purposes of the present case, it may be otherwise proved:” Cash <em>v. </em>Tozer, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20527" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 527">1 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>527</a>; King <em>v. </em>Gunnison, 4 <em>Barr </em>172. It is acknowledged that if there had been a formal return by the sheriff, in his own name, it would have been at least <em>primd facie </em>evidence of a sale and purchase by the defendant; and this shows that a judicial sale with us is not within the Statute of Frauds, for the return is of course not signed by the purchaser, who is the party to be charged.</p>
    <p id="b125-8" data-blocks='[["BL_125.8",125,[184,1806,1156,386]]]'>The proper and safe rule is for the sheriff personally to sign returns. This is his duty, and it is clearly his interest, as he is then obliged to supervise the acts of his subordinates. The subsequent order of the court, upon refusing the motion for a new trial, and overruling the motion in arrest of judgment, in relation to the filing of a release to the defendant in fee, prevents any injustice that might have occurred from the judgment in this case. Another trial could not possibly benefit the defendant, and he ought not to desire it.</p>
