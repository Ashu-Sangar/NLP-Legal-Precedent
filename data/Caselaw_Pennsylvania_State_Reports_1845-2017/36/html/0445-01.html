The plaintiff did not accept the tender of judgment, but went on to trial, and recovered a verdict and judgment for $1831.11.

This seems, for the first time, to have been doubted, in the present case. This action was brought; <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>an affidavit of defence put in to the whole claim; there was an award against the- defendants, and an appeal from it. After this, the defendants filed their plea, notifying the plaintiff of their intended defence; and four days afterwards, they made him a tender of judgment, which, if accepted, would have put an end to the controversy. But it was not accepted. The plaintiff, instead, went on to trial in the court below, and afterwards in the Supreme Court; and having experimented until he discovered that the offer made by the defendants was even better than he could now hope to obtain, he asks that the defendants may be held to their offer of compromise, although months have elapsed, and they have been to the expense and trouble of trying the case before two different tribunals, to save which was the chief cause of their offer for peace.</p>

But without this, the court was in error in entering the judgment. If the offer of judgment had been made under the Act of 21st March 1806, § 5, and the law there set out be still in force, we suppose that the defendant might have been held to his offer, unless he had asked and obtained leave of the court to withdraw it. But the offer is not under that act, but was entirely voluntary and gratuitous, and the plaintiff- did not accept it until after he had tried his chance for more in the court below, and in this court. This was equivalent to a proposal rejected, or at least not accepted in proper time. It required to be renewed or continued, in order to entitle the plaintiff to bind the defendant by accepting it. The defendant refused to continue it by opposing the motion for judgment on it,'and none ought to have been entered. The plaintiff must take back the record brought up here on the former writ of error before he can proceed.</p>
