    <p class="summary" id="b356-8" data-blocks='[["BL_356.8",356,[295,1153,1158,857]]]'>“ This suit is brought for the purpose of recovering from the defendant, William C. Boyd, the amount due the estate of John Kreider and Elizabeth his wife, as ascertained by- a report of an auditor, which was confirmed September 2d 1858, for $1180, with interest due thereon. By the proceeding referred to, it appears John Rawlins was appointed assignee of the said John Kreider and wife, in place of a former trustee, on the 2d September, 1848. On the petition of John Rawlins, there was an order granted by this court for the sale of the real estate of John Kreider, and the records show that a bond was given by the trustee at that time, with W. 0. Boyd and John W. Rawlins as his sureties, each in the sum of $3000, for the faithful performance, as is presumed, by the trustee, John Rawlins, in making the sale, and accounting for the proceeds; this sale was afterwards confirmed by the court. On the 1st November 1852, W. C. Boyd was discharged as one of the sureties of John Rawlins, from any further liabilities on his bond from that date; afterwards, there was a citation issued to John Rawlins, calling upon him to settle his account, and such proceedings were had, as resulted in the above report of the auditor.</p>

I shall consider the last branch of the defence, as presented to the court, first. It is contended, that in a legal point of view, no recovery can be had against the defendant, for it is said by his counsel, that before that can be done, they must first prosecute and obtain judgment against the principal, or have a decree of the Court of Common Pleas, for the amount due the party for whose use this suit is brought; that until that is done, no recovery can be had against the defendant, who is a <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>mere surety. This is not the law as applicable to the case now before the court; first, because the testimony goes to establish the fact, that the principal is beyond the jurisdiction -of the court, and out of the state, living in Iowa; therefore, from necessity, this action must be maintained, otherwise there will be a failure of justice; and consequently, it forms an exception to the general rule of law, which governs cases where the principal continues to reside in the state. But independent of this, it appears that the amount due by John Rawlins to the estate of John Kreider, was ascertained by the report of an auditor, and this report was com firmed by the court, which was a decree of the court of the amount which was payable by the principal, and until altered or reversed, is conclusive upon the principal, and therefore this legal objection, which has been made by the defendant, will not avail him.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b357-6" data-blocks='[["BL_357.6",357,[187,1067,1158,768]]]'>“ Although the point presented by the defendant, was handed to the court out of time, (not being handed to them until after the defendant’s counsel had addressed the court and jury, whereas our rules of court require them to be presented before any of the counsel commence addressing the court and jury in chief,) and is therefore not required to be answered by the court, and nearly a repetition of the parol points made; yet, out of courtesy to the defendant’s counsel, I will do so. As to the first branch of that point, that the liability of a surety in an official bond being contingent, suit cannot be brought against a surety by a party in interest, whether creditor, legatee, or distributee, without proceeding in the first instance against the trustee, this introductory remark to the gist of the matter is good law, in a proper case, but we think has no application to this case, as developed by the facts; and as to the other part, that no suit has been instituted by the plaintiff against John Rawlins, the trustee; the plaintiff cannot recover in this suit against the defendant, W. C. Boyd; this conclusion of the defendant, as we stated before, we think is not correct.</p>

Then, as to the identity of the person; Mr. Heister, who was the counsel to have Mr. Boyd discharged from any further liability as surety, from the 1st November 1852, testifies that while his fees were paid by the principal, yet he was spoken to by the defendant, from his liability on a bond in this estate; the sale of the property, and the confirmation, it would appear, were made before his discharge. If, therefore, you should be of the opinion, that the defendant and the surety are the same person, and his liability was incurred before he was discharged from his liability by the court, your verdict ought to be for the plaintiff.”</p>

Following this, there was evidence of the loss of the bond from the files of the court, and diligent search for it.</p>
    <p id="b358-11" data-blocks='[["BL_358.17",358,[315,2341,1154,88]],["BL_359.1",359,[181,403,1156,901]]]'>We agree with the learned judge of the Common Pleas, that the bond, having been given pursuant to statutory requirement, and <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>the records, showing that it had been approved by the court and directed to he filed, accompanied by proof of loss, and identity of the obligor sued, was evidence to go to the jury as proof of its existence as a valid instrument. Nor do I think the remark of the learned judge, that if the bond had been produced it might have been read without common-law proof of execution, was error. It might and ought to be inferred, in such a case, that its genuineness had been inquired of and passed upon by the court, before approval and direction for filing, as an integrant part of the proceedings. This is in accordance with Hartz <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Grant%20360" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="1 Grant 360">1 <em>Grant </em>360</a>, and with the general practice in regard to official bonds.

Indeed, the utility of dockets would be in a measure lost, if they could not supply proof in a case like the present. The entries are made by a public sworn officer, and as far as they are records of courts, they import absolute verity; being of such high character, therefore, little danger is to be apprehended, where loss is clearly proved, to permit them to be received as secondary evidence of the existence of things of which they only contain an official note. This disposes of the first and fourth assignments of error.</p>

That, in fact, had been done before suit brought. There had been a settlement of the trust account, a report upon it by an auditor, and confirmation by the court. This fixed the amount of assets for distribution in the hands of the assignee, and as there was no dispute about the right of the plaintiff to the fund, everything necessary to charge the principal was done before suit brought. In The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Stub, <a href="/nc/46/0150-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Jones 150" data-case-ids="8681841" data-case-paths="/nc/46/0150-01">1 <em>Jones </em>150</a>, it was said, <em>“ </em>a judgment at law or a decree of the Orphans’ Court, fixing the amount of the personal responsibility, is all that is necessary as a prerequisite to a suit on the bond of an administrator.” The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Wenrick, <a href="/watts/8/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="8 Watts 159" data-case-ids="1848438" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0159-01">8 <em>Watts </em>159</a>, is to the same effect.
