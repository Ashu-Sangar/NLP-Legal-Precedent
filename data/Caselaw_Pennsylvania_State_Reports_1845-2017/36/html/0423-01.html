The commissioners made a line in pursuance of the act, and it is said, that by this line the land in dispute is within Somerset county. In settling this part of the controversy between these parties, the jury must be governed by the line that existed at the time of the judicial sale. As far as we are informed, that was the one created by the Act of 1773, and if it embraced the land in Fayette county, the judicial sale was valid and conveyed a good title, no matter that afterwards the line was so changed as to throw tbe land into Somerset county. In our judgment, the line did not extend, by the act, down the stream to the centre of the main ridge of the mountain, but it was intended to go down to the mountain, thence up the first .ridge into the main ridge of the hill; and if the jury, from the evidence, believe that a line thus run would place this land on the west or Fayette side, their verdict must be for the plaintiffs, .unless the title was lost by the adverse holding of defendants and those under whom they claim.</p>

It is in evidence, that Moon went on the land in 1825, and remained there until his death, some eight or ten years ago, and that the possession has been kept up until the present land was cleared and cultivated, and houses erected. It does not clearly appear how far the improvements extended. . If Moon had established his lines as an improver, and held up to these boundaries for twenty-one <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>years, the law would have protected him to that extent. But in this case, by the defendants’ own showing, the lines of Moon’s claim were not run and marked until fifteen years ago.

If the owner, or his agents, made an entry on the land under claim of right, such entry would toll the statute; and, to make out the case, the defendants and those under whom they claim, must have had the possession the requisite period, either before or after such entry. If you believe the evidence, Mr. Stewart had his agent on this land, running the boundaries in the year 1840, and the agent testified that whilst he and others were surveying the tract, Moon was in company during part of the time, and said that he held under Stewart, and that Stewart’s title was good against the- world. If this is believed, it was such an entry as tolled the statute. The improver held fifteen years before this entry, and seventeen years thereafter. But even if you believe that Moon, and those who hold his claim, have had the adverse and uninterrupted possession of part of the land for the statutory period, the defence .cannot be sustained to that part, unless the defendants.have furnished you with such evidence as will enable you to set it off to them.

If, by the old line, the land lay in Somerset county, the judicial sale conveyed no title to the purchaser; but if in Fayette county, the proceedings were legal; and the subsequent change of the line, and consequent change of the position of the land, did not in the least affect the plaintiffs’ title under the sale. John Hanna, one of the commissioners that ran the line in 1844, testified that they did not know of the existence of the Act of 1773, and were not governed by it, hut that they made the line according to their own judgments, and that they occasionally varied their running to suit the wishes of persons residing along the route. Some of the witnesses say that the old line lay on the other side of the tract, whilst others are clear that it is a mile on this side. The surveyor that located the warrant returned it as lying in Fayette, where it was taxed from 1794. Mr. Colborn says that the residents on the land voted in this county. It is for the jury to determine the location of the land, from all the evi<a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>dence in the case, and if it was in Fayette by the line of 1773, then the judicial proceedings gave a valid title to the purchaser; and if it was never divested, the plaintiffs must have your verdict. The only effect of the change, by the Act of 1844, is to justify the plaintiffs in bringing this action in this county instead of Fayette.”</p>
