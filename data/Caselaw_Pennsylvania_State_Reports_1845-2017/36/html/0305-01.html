There was so much evidence before the jury implicating Fuller, that the court could not, under the undisputed rule in such cases, permit the jury first to pass upon his case, so that he could be used as a witness for Shay, and the same would have been the case with all the defendants, had they been tried under the same circumstances.

Our statutes now require separate trials, if desired, in all cases of felonious homicide;' and if, in such cases, the waiting or postponed defendants be competent witnesses, it ought to be made known. Indeed, if such a rule as to testimony is to prevail, we cannpt see why, in all indictments charging joint offences for other felonies or misdemeanors, the discretion to grant separate trials to defendants should not be exercised. Wherever there is an allegation, supported by affidavit, that the testimony of one or more defendants is needed for another co-defendant, if competent, as witnesses on separate trials, they ought never to be excluded by the arbitrary order of the court, directing a joint trial. We have, however, given to this subject full consideration, arid from .the examination we have made in the books, we are disposed to think our ruling on the trial was correct. The rule, so far as it appears to us, is, that in all cases where defendants are jointly indicted, one defendant cannot be a witness for another, until at least the jury has passed upon the case of the proposed witness; consequently, a defendant who has not been yet tried, cannot be a witness for his co-defendant. When separately indicted, and the offences thus not alleged by the record to be joint, though in fact charged with the same offences, one can be a witness for the other upon separate trials. . It is not necessary for us to seek for reasons for this rule, if the books to which we propose to refer, many of which we have examined, others being taken by reference from other books, clearly -recognising, as well by the direct opinions of judges, both at Nisi Prius and in banc, and also adopted by writers on evidence, without even a doubting comment. In some of the cases to which we refer, the opinion is only that when separately indicted they may be used as witnesses, the reason being that they are thus separated, <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>leading to the plain inference that if joint it would be otherwise, the exception in the case providing the more general rule.</p>

The court cannot but say that under the evidence given upon the trial, they were entirely satisfied with the verdict. Even looking to the theory of the pending attack, and necessary defence alleged upon the part of the defendants, and said now to be provable by the other defendants, there would be difficulty, as argued by the district attorney, in reconciling such a theory with the position of the head of the deceased as shown by the places where the shot from the gun struck him, scattered too as they were according to the testimony of the physician; but still perhaps the evidence 'might produce an acquittal, and if it ought to be received now, he has the right so to construe it. But the question is, ought we, under the rules of practice adopted for criminal cases, to admit such evidence as grounds for a new trial. It must be borne in mind, that upon the trial, the evidence was rejected by the court, and that the <a id="p309" href="#p309" data-label="309" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*309</a>testimony upon the part of the Commonwealth was of such a character so apparently implicating the defendants, as would have prevented the court, upon a joint trial, directing a verdict to be passed during the trial as to any of them.</p>

We álso see great difficulty in the case ourselves; it would cause great uncertainty to attend upon joint trials; the experience of courts shows that the degrees of guilt in connexion with the alleged offence by different defendants is frequently quite difficult to determine; and hence an acquittal of one would often call for a discharge of the verdict as to the others.

It is manifest, that justice will ordinarily be more faithfully administered, by adhering to certain and known rules, founded on proper precedents, than to trust to the sudden, and sometimes impulsive opinions of judges, led away by the peculiar appearances of some particular case. The discretion which courts are to exercise in granting new trials, is not arbitrary will alone, it is a legal discretion, controlled by established principles, which, when ascertained, judges must carry out. If it be supposed, that injustice has been done in any single case, from the inability of the-party, by reason of some technical form of practice, to introduce his testimony before a jury, the power of pardon can be exercised by the executive, and the party freed from the difficulty in which he is then placed. It is better that this should be the remedy, than to introduce or countenance a practice which we cannot but think would be attended by evil consequences. In addition to the examination we have made in relation to the practice in criminal courts, we have made all search in our power into those relating to civil practice, and we could find no case, which, as a precedent, will support by analogy the views advanced upon the part of the defendant.</p>

By the 40th section of the Act of the 31st March 1860, “ to consolidate, revise, and amend the laws of this Commonwealth relating to penal proceedings and pleadings,” it is enacted, “in all cases in'which two or more persons are jointly indicted for any offence, it shall be at the discretion of the court <a id="p312" href="#p312" data-label="312" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*312</a>to try them jointly or severally ; except that in cases of felonious homicide, the parties charged shall have the right to ■ separate trials; and in all cases of joint trials, the accused shall have the right to the same number of peremptory challenges to which either would be entitled if separately tried, and no more.” The first part of this section is the same substantially with the New York act, except that the latter extends the right to demand separate trials to all felonies: 3 <em>New York Revised Statutes, </em>5th ed. p. 1028, § 22.</p>
    <p id="b312-4" data-blocks='[["BL_312.5",312,[293,783,1155,844]]]'>All these defendants were jointly indicted for the same offence, and none of them were, at the time of the offer, either acquitted or convicted, and were therefore all parties to the record. In the state of New York, defendants so situated have been uniformly held incompetent. The People <em>v. </em>Bill, <a href="/johns/10/0095-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="10 Johns. 95" data-case-ids="2135851" data-case-paths="/johns/10/0095-01">10 <em>Johns. </em>95</a>, decided in 1813, laid this rule down distinctly, that where persons are jointly indicted and tried separately, one cannot be a witness for the other, unless he has been previously acquitted or convicted. This case (after the passage of the New York act above referred to) was recognised and affirmed in The People <em>v. </em>Williams, <a href="/wend/19/0377-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="19 Wend. 377" data-case-ids="2023454" data-case-paths="/wend/19/0377-01">19 <em>Wend. </em>377</a> (in May 1838), and in McIntyre <em>v. </em>The People, 5 <em>Selden </em>38 (in 1853), which is reported in the court below in 1 <em>Parker’s Criminal Cases </em>371. The same rule is adopted in The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Maul, <a href="/mass/27/0057-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="10 Pick. 57" data-case-ids="2014250" data-case-paths="/mass/27/0057-01">10 <em>Pick. </em>57</a>, which is recognised and approved in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Robinson, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Gray%20559" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="1 Gray 559">1 <em>Gray </em>559</a>, 560, in 1854; and in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Manson, 2 <em>Ash. </em>39, Judge King considers it settled, as does Mr. Greenleaf: 1 <em>Creenleaf’s Ev., </em>§ 363. The cases are collected in the note to Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Maul, in 1 <em>Leading Criminal Cases </em>125, and entirely sustain the ruling of the court below.</p>
