The justice rendered judgment in favour of the attaching creditors, for $43.04, from which the garnishee appealed; and in the Common Pleas a case was stated for the opinion of the court, with leave to either party to sue out a writ of error, in which the following facts were set forth:—</p>

Benn went into possession under the agreement, and built a house upon it, and, in the mean time, worked for Mrs. Scott whenever required; so that at the last settlement between the parties, in 1858, there was due to Benn, for wages, $58, which was to be credited on account of the purchase-money of the lot.</p>

Mrs. Scott refused to take the money, or to make him a deed for the lot.

L. </em>460, it is provided, that the wages of any labourer shall not be liable to attachment in the hands of the employer. As these terms are extensive, the Supreme Court has found it necessary to define and limit them, in order to restrict their application according to the intention of the legislature. Where there was a contract by the 'master to hire two of his apprentices for wages, it was held, that the amount of such wages might be attached for the master’s debt in the hands of the employer; so where a man contracted to repair the streets, and had horses, carts, and men employed to do the work at certain wages, it was held, that the sum due for their work to the contractor was liable to be attached for his debt in the hands of his employers, and that the true meaning of the wages of labour, is such wages as the labourer, by occupation, earns with his own hands, which the law intended to protect from attachment, as necessary for his immediate and daily support: Heebner <em>v. </em>Chave,' 5 <em>Barr </em>115. Two considerations enter into this definition: 1st, The description of the labourer who may claim the exemption; and 2d, The reason for granting it. As the law giving priority to servants’ wages in the payments by executors and administrators, confines the description to menial servants, so this act, exempting the wages of labourers from attachment, is held to be confined to manual labourers, persons who are labourers by their calling, and earn their wages with their own hands. Evans Benn, we suppose, comes within this description, agreeably to the case stated. The reason for exempting the wages of such persons from attachment when the wages are still in the hands of their employer, is that they are deemed necessary for the subsistence of themselves and their families. But for this consideration there would be no more justice in exempting a sum of money <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>due the labourer for wages, than there would be in exempting a sum due him for any article of goods and chattels sold, or for money lent.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b344-6" data-blocks='[["BL_344.6",344,[298,511,1155,1362]]]'>“ The contract between Evans Benn and Alice Scott, did not, from the first, contemplate the payment of any money by the latter to him for the work which he was to do for her; but his work was to be performed, and the price or value of it was to be taken as so much purchase-money for the lot which she agreed to sell to him. They had settlements, it would seem, after this arrangement was agreed upon, and at their <em>last </em>settlement the wages of his labour were ascertained to amount to the sum of $58, which <em>was .to be on account of the purchase-money of the lot. </em>He did not regard, at least before he was ousted, the sum he had earned by his labour in any other light than as so much purchase-money; he has never demanded it of her as wages for his subsistence, nor demanded that it should be paid to him, but even after she made the deed to Heidelbaugh, he went to her house, tendered the balance over and above the said $58, and demanded a title for the lot according to their contract. The lot has been recovered from him by ejectment. If he acquiesce in that verdict and judgment, he may claim damages for the violation of the contract of bargain and sale of the premises in an action against Alice Scott; and the payment of $58 in labour, on account of the purchase-money agreed on, will constitute a part of his claim. She owes him that amount, at least, on the case stated, being so much paid to her as part of the consideration of the lot Avhich she agreed to sell to him, and afterwards sold and conveyed to another; but as this was never regarded by him as wages, so. called, which he was earning for his subsistence, but as so much money paid to her, so must we consider it, and therefore it is to be treated just as so much money paid in coin on a contract that has failed, and which he is entitled on that account to recover back. We are of opinion, that the plaintiffs can recover under this attachment. Let judgment be entered for the plaintiffs-for $43.04, with interest from November 20th 1858, and costs.”</p>

The ’ case says they were <em>wages </em>which were to be on account of the purchase-money of the lot. They never became purchase-money, becaus'e the lot never was conveyed according to contract. Benn did all in his power to fulfil the contract and turn the wages into purchase-money, but he was not permitted to do so. He never got the lot, and therefore never owed any purchase-money. Hence it was not called purchase-money in the case'stated, but wages of labour. But even if it was purchase-money, it was still the <em>wages of labour. ■ </em>The money was all earned by his own hands, and necessarily was wages until it was exchanged for real estate.</p>
