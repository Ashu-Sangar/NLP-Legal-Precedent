Dr. Smith, a survey thereon of the 14th June 1793, which was returned on the 15th July 1794. Courses and lines, corresponding with the date of the survey, are found on the ground, and it is in evidence, that the traverse of the river, as laid down in the official draft, corresponds with the official courses of the same. This would end the cause, but it is shown, that on the 7th April 1807, the then owners of this, and some twelve other adjoining survey®, petitioned the board of property for an order of resurvey, stating in their petition ‘ that it is alleged that there are inaccuracies in the surveys of the said land, and. some interferences, and before a partition can be made it is necessary more particularly to identify and ascertain the quanties in said surveys.’ The board granted the order for a resurvey, which was made on the 15th of April 1808, and accepted on the 21st November of the same year. This resurvey made a different line on the eastern end of this tract; established a new line some 63 perches south of the long line, parallel to the 'river; and from sugar corner, then established, ran the course of the original survey to the old hickory; the river was laid down as in the original survey. The course from the sugar to the hickory is found to be S. 4° E. no marks are found on it; while in the line of the original survey, S. 4° E. to the hickory, is found a tree which blocks to the date^of the resurvéy, viz. 1808. As no patent has ever issued for this land, and as it was all included in the original survey, and the Commonwealth was paid for it, we hold, on the authority of Bryson <em>v. </em>Hower, 8 <em>S. ‡ R. </em>409, that if you find that the deputy surveyor who made the resurvey, either by mistake or design, left out a portion of the tract, the original owner, or those claiming under him, would still have the right to his patent, under his original survey, unless he abandoned, and claimed by the lines of the resurvey. The resurvey, as returned, takes from the defendants about one-third of their land, and the marks on the line, from the sugar to the hickory, do not corres<a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>pond with the return of resurvey. Plow have the defendants held ? On the one hand, it has been shown that they have cut timber outside of the old survey, and within the lines of the resurvey, and that in a deed they hold a portion of the land, in which the resurvey is made part of the recital. On the other hand, you have evidence that they made an improvement on the western <em>end of the </em>tract, part of which was outside of the line S. 4 E. from the hickory to the sugar, but within the lines of the original survey. It is true, this improvement was for some time-suffered to go down, but it was afterwards resumed, and is now occupied. Nor is this all; the defendants in 1839 built a valuable grist-mill, at great cost, the mill-dam of which is altogether on that part of the land which lies within the lines of 1793 and 1808; and that a cabin-house was built upon that portion which was in the actual occupancy of the man called Hewitt, at the time the plaintiff’s survey was made.</p>
