We contend that the statutes embrace the case at bar. The words “ no costs shall be paid by such innocent person,” and “all costs accruing on all bills of indictment,” are broad enough to embrace the costs of the defendant’s subpoenas and necessary witnesses.</p>

The defendant in error, plaintiff below, was one of the witnesses of a party indicted and tried for perjury. The jury acquitted the accused, and directed that the county pay the costs of prosecution. The Act of Assembly of 8th December 1804, authorized such a verdict; but the plaintiff was not a witness on behalf of the prosecution, and his charges are no part of the costs of prosecution. He is not therefore within the remedy of this statute.</p>

So it does in respect to the preliminary examination before a committing magistrate; but it is silent in respect to the power of juries over costs. Hence <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>it was the practice under this act, to make defendants pay the costs of prosecution, though they were acquitted by the petit jury trying them; a hardship which led to and is recited by the Act of 20th March 1797. By this last-named act, “.all costs accruing on all bills of indictment” were charged upon the county, if the accused were acquitted by the petit jury.</p>

Where they are imposed upon the county, they are only the costs of the prosecution that are to be paid; and even if the larger expression of the Act of 1797 were taken — “ all costs accruing on all bills of indictment” — the plaintiff’s case would not be included, for his costs did not accrue upon the bill of indictment, but in resistance of it.</p>
