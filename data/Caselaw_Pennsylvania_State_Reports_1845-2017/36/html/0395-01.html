In-it he claimed a credit of $121.26 for travelling expenses in attending to the business of the estate, besides $380 for commissions. The account was referred to an auditor for adjustment, who surcharged the accountant with the sum of $165, which it was shown he had received for interest on moneys of the estate loaned out by him; and also with the further sum of $221.30, for.interest on the trust-moneys which were shown to be invested and bearing interest, up to the time of filing the report. He also reduced the credit claimed for travelling expenses from $121.26 to $50, and charged the accountant with $7.50 for one-half of the auditor’s fees. This report was confirmed by the court, and distribution decreed accordingly ; whereupon, the accountant took his appeal to this court.</p>

Their having charged themselves with the uncollected bonds and notes, did not terminate the ownership of them in equity by the legatees. Nothing less than actual payment of _the amount could do that. Of course, the interest, being an accretion, continued to attend the ownership of the principal.</p>

It accrued, indeed, after the accounts had been filed, but the accountants had brought before the court, for adjudication, the funds themselves upon which it accrued, and a court of equity will always, if possible, make a complete disposition of the subject-matter which it has in hand.</p>
    <p id="b396-12" data-blocks='[["BL_396.18",396,[309,1960,1158,427]]]'>We approve also of the refusal of the Orphans’ Court to allow the sums claimed for expenses. Five per cent, commissions were credited to the appellants, as if they had collected all the credits of the estate with which they charged themselves. Yet upon a large portion of this they had expended no care and labour, nor had they incurred any risk. The auditor thought the allowances made were sufficient to cover all needful expenses, as well as to make a just compensation for care, labour, and hazard. We cannot say- either that he was mistaken in his report, or that the court erred in confirming it.</p>
