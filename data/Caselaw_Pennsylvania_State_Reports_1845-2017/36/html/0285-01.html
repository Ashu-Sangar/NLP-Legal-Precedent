The reason is, because by the note not being paid, he has notice to put him on inquiry why it has not been paid.” And in Barnet <em>v. </em>Offerman, <a href="/watts/7/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="7 Watts 130" data-case-ids="1846832" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0130-01">7 <em>Watts </em>130</a>, a nearly identical case, as to <a id="p289" href="#p289" data-label="289" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*289</a>its principal features, with the present, Judge Huston approved of the case of Tinson <em>v. </em>Francis, and disapproved of Charles <em>v. </em>Marsden, 1 <em>Taunt. </em>244, which was certainly doubted in those editions of <em>Chitty </em>and in the 5th edition of <em>Bayley on Bills. </em>In Snyder <em>v. </em>Riley, 6 <em>Barr </em>164, Chief Justice Gibson, in 1847, cites Tonson <em>v. </em>Francis with entire approbation, and says: “It has been for some time settled, though it was at one time more than doubted, that an endorser of overdue paper takes it exclusively on the credit of the endorser, and subject, even without proof of <em>mala fides, </em>to all intrinsic considerations that would affect it between the original parties.” In Tams <em>v. </em>Way, 1 <em>Harris </em>222, this case of Snyder <em>v. </em>Riley is said to have been deliberately considered; and in The Lancaster Bank <em>v. </em>Woodward, 6 <em>Harris </em>361, Judge Woodward adopts the very language of the late Chief Justice Gibson already quoted from Snyder <em>v. </em>Riley. This has been undoubtedly the settled law of this state, as evidenced by an unbroken series of decisions, for nearly forty years.

B., says, p. 708 : “ The fact of a bill being overdue, calls for inquiry on the part of him who takes it;” and then quotes what Bulled, J., said in Brown <em>v. </em>Davies, 3 <em>T. R. </em>80, and adds himself: “ In fact it is a disgraced bill; anybody may take it from the holder, but he takes only the right the holder had.” Pollock, <a id="p290" href="#p290" data-label="290" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*290</a>C. B., says, p. 710: “ It is impossible to reconcile all the <em>dicta </em>upon this subject. As to all the world except the drawer and acceptor, no doubt, the acceptance is to be taken to be an acceptance for value; but the question is, whether there is not a difference where the bill is endorsed over by the drawer after it has become due.” Alderson, B., delivering the opinion of the court, said: “ The court are unanimously of opinion in this case (and after some little doubt, at first entertained by one of its members) that there should be a <em>venire de novo. </em>The ease mainly relied upon for the defendant in error was that of Charles <em>v. </em>Marsden, 1 <em>Taunt. </em>224, where it was held, that <em>it </em>is not a defence to an action by the endorsee of a bill of exchange, to plead that it was accepted for the accommodation of the drawer without consideration, and was endorsed over after it became due. But in that case the question arose upon the pleadings; whereas here it is presented on the evidence. And we think, under the circumstances stated in this bill of exceptions, there was evidence for the jury of an engagement on the part of Allen not to negotiate the bill mentioned in the second count, after it became due; therefore, without going further into the case, it is enough to say, that there must be a <em>venire de novo.”</em>

Coleridge, J., in delivering the opinion of the court, said (the case having occurred since the passage of the Common Law Procedure Act,' 1854): <em>“ </em>As we are, however, called upon to deal with this case as if we were sitting in a court of equity, we think that we ought to decide it according to what we believe the doctrine in courts of equity.” He had previously examined and commented on the cases of Hollier <em>v. </em>Eyre, 9 <em>Cl. &amp; Fin. </em>1, 45, in the House of Lords, and of Davies <em>v. </em>Stainhanks, 6 <em>De G.

S.) </em>338, decided by the Court of Common Pleas on the 5th November 1858, it was held a good and equitable defence, for the defendant to set up that he signed the promissory note as surety merely, to the knowledge of the plaintiff, and that goods of the principal <a id="p291" href="#p291" data-label="291" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*291</a>debtor, of which the plaintiff held a bill of sale for the same debt, which if properly sold, would have sufficed to satisfy the whole claim of the plaintiff; yet that, by his negligence and misconduct at the sale, a loss was occasioned; and that it was not material for this purpose that the fact of the suretyship did not appear on the face of the instrument itself. The case in 7 <em>Lilis Bl. </em>is referred to, and Byles, J., said: “At law, as between a creditor and two joint makers, or joint and several makers, of a promissory note, both are principals; and evidence is inadmissible to show either to be a surety except, between joint debtors, for contribution ; but in equity you may always show that one is a surety.”</p>

The drawer held the bill till it was overdue, when he endorsed it without value to the plaintiff, and afterwards sold the canvas, and held the proceeds to be applied to the payment of the bill.” “The plaintiff took the bill subject to the equities affecting it.” Williams, J., said: “I agree that when it is said an endorsee takes subject to equities, the equities must arise out of the original transaction.” Crowder, J., said: “ The case is within the ordinary rule applying to parties taking a bill by endorsement subject to equities which affect it.”</p>

This was felt in Philadelphia nearly forty years ago, when three of the strongest banks of the present day were almost overwhelmed and nearly ruined by the discount of large amounts for persons whose capitals consisted almost entirely of bank accommodation. In 1857, the same system prevailed in this country to a very large extent; and one institution was mainly destroyed by <a id="p292" href="#p292" data-label="292" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*292</a>a similar practice. In England, the failure of numerous joint-stock and private banks, and of large commercial, mining, and manufacturing concerns, proceeding from the same causes, has determined the capitalists and men of business to set their faces against the whole rotten system of accommodation bills and notes. The courts always follow such necessities, and old sound rules of law are generally restored or revived by the exigencies of the times.</p>

Three years after it is due, it is taken by the plaintiff from the endorser in a dicker, the plaintiff thinking it strange he should have held a note of the kind while Bower <em>&amp; </em>Grosh were pushing him on judgments they had against him, and selling his farm and other real estate he had in Lycoming county. It was therefore not only a disgraced bill, but, from the evidence, taken under circumstances of grave suspicion, and it seems probable, without any very real value being given for it. It is clear, however, that under no state of the matter could the holder recover more than what he actually gave for it, and upon proper notice from the defendant t.o prove consideration, the truth would undoubtedly have been reached to the satisfaction of the jury.</p>
