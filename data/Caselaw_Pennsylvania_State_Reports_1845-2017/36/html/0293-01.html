The defendant alleges that the note was given to a firm composed of Jacob Kichline and Thomas Kichline, who did business under the name of Jacob Kichline, and not to Jacob Kichline individually, and the suit cannot be sustained by Jacob Kichline or his administrators, but that it should have been brought in the names of Jacob Kichline and Thomas Kichline, if both were living at the time of suit brought, and if not, in the name of the surviving partner. If the note was given to Jacob Kichline individually, then the suit is properly brought in his name or those of his administrators. Or if the business was conducted in the name of Jacob Kichline, and Thomas Kichline took no part in transacting the business of the firm, the writ is properly brought in Jacob Kichline’s name, or those of his administrators. But if the business was conducted in the name of Jacob Kichline, and if Thomas was an active partner, that is, took part in transacting the business of the firm, the plaintiff cannot recover in the present action. Whether the note was given to Jacob Kichline individually, or if not, whether Thomas did or did not take part in the transaction of the business of the firm, are questions of fact for you.</p>

B. Duffin and the said defendant jointly and severally promised to pay the said plaintiff or order three hundred and twenty-one dollars, without defalcation, for value received. Upon the face of the note, the suit was properly brought in the name of Jacob Kichline (upon whose death his administrators had been substituted), but it was alleged on the part of the defendant, that the note was given to a firm consisting of Jacob Kichline and Thomas Kichline, trading under the firm of Jacob Kichline, and that therefore the plaintiffs could not recover; and the defendant’s first point was directed to this aspect of the case. The plaintiffs asked the court in their first point to charge, that if the jury believe that Thomas Kichline was a dormant partner with Jacob Kichline, the suit is properly brought in the name of Jacob Kichline alone. This point was answered favourably to the plaintiffs; and in this we can perceive no error, for the question of fact, whether he was a dormant partner or not, was fairly submitted to the jury. The law is well settled, that a dormant partner may join and sue on a bill or note, or the ostensible partner may sue alone.</p>

The second point of the plaintiffs was negatived; the third point was substantially negatived, for it was made to depend upon whether “Jacob Kichline,” in the note, meant the individual name of Jacob Kichline or the firm name; whether the suit was properly brought in his name alone. The fourth point, as to the fact stated in it raising .a presumption that the note was given to Jacob Kichline individually, was distinctly negatived, but it was properly said that it -w;as evidence for the jury, who are to determine that fact from the whole evidence. In all this we can see no error, and what we have said forms an answer to all the errors (which are often only repetitions of each other in different language), except those relating to the rejection and- admission of evidence. The third, fifth, eighth, ninth, and tenth errors were not argued by the plaintiffs in error.</p>
