      <em>“ </em>In pursuance of this ordinance, the street committee, on the 2d of July 1855, invited proposals for the grading and paving of First, among other streets, in the third ward of Allegheny, by advertising for the same in the Pittsburgh Daily Dispatch. Several proposals or bids — seven at least in number — were received by the street committee, and on the 18 th of July 1855, the contract for the work was awarded, by the committee, to Palmer &amp; Tyler, they being the lowest and best bidders. But Tyler did not, in point of fact, become a party to the contract. Gang &amp; Co., to whom he had sold, being substituted in his place, in the written contract, signed by the parties. It seems, that contracts for the grading and paving of some other streets, for which Palmer &amp; Tyler had also submitted proposals, were at the same time awarded to them; and Tyler, being apprehensive that he and Palmer had not sufficient capital to enable them to carry on and complete the work, procured Gang &amp; Co. to take his place, who, upon giving the required security, were accepted by the street committee, and <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>allowed to become parties along with Palmer, to the contract. Palmer, Gang &amp; Co. were, therefore, the actual contractors for the work, at the prices hidden therefor by Palmer &amp; Tyler. Sometime during the progress of the work, Adams, one of the company, sold his interest in the contract to Grebing, who afterwards sold to McIntyre. The work of grading and paving was done by the contractors, under the direction and supervision of the street commissioner, and the street committee, who examined it from time to time as it progressed, approved of the materials used, and of the manner in which the grading and paving were done. And when the work was completed, it was examined by the street committee, approved of, and taken off of the contractors’ hands. The work was completed in November 1856; and, shortly after, the costs and expenses thereof were assessed and apportioned by the street commissioner, to the lots or squares described in these cases, and to the other lots or squares fronting on the said street, by an equal assessment on the feet front thereof. Bills were then made out and furnished to the defendants, as the street commissioner has testified, showing the various items making up the amount of the assessment on each lot or square, to wit, the number of cubic yards of excavation or filling, and the costs thereof — the number of square yards of stone pavement in the cartway, and the cost thereof — the number of square yards of brick pavement in sidewalk, and the cost thereof — and the number of feet (lineal measure) of curbstone, and the cost thereof — the prices according to which the cost of said items was estimated and ascertained, being the same as those mentioned in the contract, and at which the ■work was let to Tyler &amp; Palmer. Two or three demands of the amount of said assessment, were made by the commissioner — the last of which, as testified by the commissioner, was made from both of the defendants, on the 19th of December 1856 — and not having been paid, the statement on which the writs of <em>scire facias </em>in these cases were issued, was filed in the office of the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas, of this county, on the 7th of February 1857, and entered on record in said court, at March Term, 1857, No. 87. The plaintiffs claim to recover in each of these cases, the amount assessed on the respective lots or squares therein described, with interest from the demand as aforesaid.</p>

When the street was opened, the land was in the occupancy of Garrard; but by whom or by what authority it was opened, has not been shown. We only know from hearsay evidence, that Garrard was a tenant of Croghan (who had a life estate in the land), under a twenty-one years’ lease, .when the street was opened. But the lease has not been produced, .nor its provisions shown. Where a street has been laid out, opened, and used by the public, without interruption, for a period of twenty-one years and upward, the law presumes a grant of the easement; and the presumption arising in this case, is not rebutted by the fact that Mrs. Sehenley was married during her infancy, and that she wras under the disability of coverture when her father died in September 1850. The defendants have never attempted to close this street; and if it was opened in 1830, and has been used, without interruption, by the public since that time, as the defendants’ evidence shows, then it was a permanent street, within the meaning of the act, and the councils of the city were authorized to grade and pave it.</p>

The councils of the city of Allegheny were only authorized to assess and impose a tax for the grading and paving of said street, on the footing of a <em>bond fide </em>contract made by them, or of the actual value of the work done thereon; there is nothing in the terms of the contract <a id="p44" href="#p44" data-label="44" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*44</a>tinder which the work was done, rendering it void for want of authority in the councils to make it, nor to prevent the plaintiffs from recovering interest on the assessments from the date of the demand; the law authorizes an assessment to defray the expense of curbstones, as well as other necessary materials used in paving a street, and for the paving of footways or sidewalks, and creates a lien therefor; the whole cost of grading and paving the street in question, might properly be apportioned among the several blocks or squares fronting thereon, so as to assess upon each separate block or square, by an equal assessment on the feet front, its <em>fro rata </em>share or proportion thereof; and for each of said assessments thus made, distinct writs of <em>scire facias </em>might properly be issued, as was done in these cases; the act does not contemplate that where more grading or filling is done in front of one lot or square, than there is in front of another on the same street, that allowance should be made therefor in making the assessment; but the whole cost and expenses of grading, and paving a street, are to he defrayed by an equal assessment on the feet front of the property abutting thereon; the proceedings in these cases are in the name of the Commonwealth, for the use of the mayor, aldermen, and citizens of Allegheny, and there is no evidence, <em>outside </em>of the contract, that any other parties are interested therein; and ‘looking to the terms of the contract,’ there is no evidence that the contractors are the substantial parties to these proceedings; these proceedings are not upon the contract, but under the statute, and the lien sought to be enforced against the defendants’ real estate, does not arise out of the contract, but has its origin and foundation in the assessment made under and by virtue of the statute. If the assessment was justly and fairly made, it is a lien on the defendants’ property, and its payment may be enforced. If the contract for this work was awarded, in good faith, to the lowest and best bidders; if the work was executed substantially in accordance with the terms of the contract, and the provisions of the ordinance; if it was well done, and the materials used were of a good quality ; if there was no actual fraud, éither in the making or in the execution of the contract; and if the street committee were guilty of no fraud or collusion, in taking the work off of the contractors’ hands, then the mere fact that the mayor and one or two members of councils may have been parties to, or otherwise actually interested in, the contract; or that a present of a gold watch was made to the street commissioners, which was not retained, but almost immediately returned by him, will not prevent a recovery in these cases.</p>

The jury will then determine, — 1st. Whether the work was done substantially in accordance with the terms of the contract, and the requirements of the ordinance? 2d. If there was any defect in the quality of the materials used, or in the manner of doing the work— whether it was owing to the fraud, collusion, or gross negligence of the contractors, and the officers of the city having the supervision and control of the work ?</p>

And so, undoubtedly, it would be, if the provisions of the act creating the lien, and of the act providing a mode for enforcing its collection, were not inconsistent and irreconcilable with the provisions of that act. The Acts of 1849 and 1851, under which the assessments in these cases become a lien, made no provision for its being made a matter of record, and imposed no limits upon its duration. On the contrary, it is expressly provided, that the assessments shall be a lien upon the real estate, upon which they may be assessed, from the time of making such assessments until they shall be fully paid and satisfied. And the Act of 1852, which provides a mode for enforcing the collection of the assessments made under the former acts, to defray the costs and expenses incurred in grading and paving, expressly declares, that they shall be and remain a lien on the property from the time mentioned in the second section of the Act of 1849, until fully paid and satisfied; thus re-enacting the provisions of that act with respect to the duration of the lien, for the express purpose, as it would seem, of repelling the inference that might possibly otherwise arise, that by providing, the remedy therein it was intended to make the lien subject to the limitation of the Act of 1845. To hold, therefore, that the lien arising under the Acts of 1849 and 1852 is subject to the limitation of the Act of 1845, when the legislature have expressly declared in both the former acts, that the lien shall remain until fully paid and satisfied, would be not to interpret but to repeal the law as made by the legislature, and that, too, in a case where the legislative mind is fully and clearly expressed.</p>

Notwithstanding this provision, the obligation to pay still rests on the city, and the remedy of the contractors to enforce the payment is against the city alone.

But it is no concern to them who the contractors were, or by whom the work was done. Why, then, when the work has been well done, and at fair and reasonable prices, without any fraud or collusion, and when the assessments therefor have been justly and properly made (as the evidence most clearly shows, and as the jury have found) should the defendants be allowed to reap the benefits of the improvement without bearing the burden which the law justly imposes therefor, while the property of others, similarly situated, is subject to a like burthen for improvements made for the .common benefit? Satisfied as I am with the finding of the jury, and believing that these defendants have no real cause of complaint on the ground of fraud or oppression, I am not disposed to hold, that the lien in these cases arising out of assessments which are found to have been fairly and <a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>justly made, is invalid and incapable of being enforced, simply because the mayor and one or more of the councils of the city were parties to the contract under which the work was done. It would be setting up a technical point of the sharpest kind, on which to sacrifice the justice of the case. For these reasons, and for those heretofore given on the trial, I am of the opinion that the plaintiffs are entitled to judgment on the verdict in each of the cases.”</p>

The claim was for the costs and expenses of grading First street. It was filed originally in the Court of Common Pleas, and it is now-argued that the District Court had no authority to issue a <em>scire facias </em>founded thereon. The Acts of Assembly of June 16th 1836, <em>Pamph. L. </em>745, §§ 6 and 7, and March 13th 1844, <em>Pamph. L. </em>
      <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>102, § 14, require that all indictments and civil actions in which the city of Pittsburgh or of Allegheny may be directly or indirectly interested, shall be tried in the District Court, before a jury from which all persons resident or owning property in said city shall be excluded. The acts further provide, that the certificate of the Mayor’s Court of the . city of Pittsburgh, or of the president judge of the fifth judicial district, composed of the county of Allegheny, that the indictment or civil cause proposed to be removed is, in bis opinion, within the meaning of the first (seventh) section of the act, shall be conclusive evidence of the jurisdiction of the District Court in such case, and that thereupon the indictment, and all papers connected therewith, if it be a criminal case, or the original writ, declaration, and all papers connected therewith, if it be a civil case, shall be transmitted to said District Court. It is clear, that exclusive authority to try the class of cases described in these acts is conferred upon the District Court. But it is said, that before the jurisdiction can attach, there must be a certificate from the president judge of the Common Pleas. To this it might be answered, that even if such a certificate were necessary to bring the case into that court, it would not be for the defendants to object to its absence, after having appeared, pleaded, and gone on to trial. It is not to be denied, that when the case is in that court, it has authority to try. The objection, therefore, is not to the judicial power of the court, hut to the mode in which the case is brought before it. If available at any stage of the proceeding, it must have been taken before general appearance and plea in bar.</p>
    <p id="b54-6" data-blocks='[["BL_54.6",54,[297,1580,1156,854]],["BL_55.1",55,[252,414,1161,690]]]'>There was not, however, even an irregularity in the form of proceeding. The District Court has general authority to issue writs of <em>scire facias. </em>The amount of the claim in this case, and the subject-matter, were completely within its jurisdiction. Even without the Acts of 1836 and 1844, there could, therefore, have been no other obstacle in the way of its writ of <em>scire facias, </em>than the fact that the claim had been filed in another court. It is true, that such a writ is, in England, judicial, in most cases; and hence it follows, that it must issue out of the court in which the record is, upon which it is founded. But with us, it is often an original, not even resting upon a record. It is often substantially an action of debt, and it cannot, therefore, be fatal to it, that its foundation lies in another court. Thus, a <em>scire facias </em>may be maintained in the Common Pleas upon a recognisance in the Orphans’ Court. Municipal claims and mechanics’ claims are not strictly records. Acts of Assembly have authorized writs of <em>scire facias </em>to recover them, but there is nothing in their nature to confine jurisdiction over them to the court among whose records they may be filed. The Acts of 1836 and 1844, however, confer upon the District Court plenary and exclusive jurisdiction over municipal claims of <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>the city of Allegheny. In that court they must be tried. Surely, an act which declares that certain eases shall he tried in a designated court, empowers that court to do all which is necessary to try them. To the exercise of this power, authority to bring the litigant parties before it is essential. Nor do the acts confer jurisdiction over such cases only as may be certified. No provision is made fomcertifying any other than <em>pending■ </em>cases. The District Court is authorized to try all cases. It does not derive its jurisdiction from the certificate, but from the statutes. But if the certificate applies only to' cases pending in the Common Pleas, how can its absence amount to prohibition of a <em>scire facias </em>upon a claim, in regard to -which there is no case pending ? We cannot think the legislature intended the idle form of a <em>scire facias </em>first in the Common Pleas, and then a certificate to the District Court, a form, the only effects of which would have been, to complicate the proceedings, and multiply costs to the parties.</p>

That statute is not an indefinite enactment, authorizing a statement to be filed, without prescribing what it shall contain. On the contrary, it points out distinctly what matters the claimant shall set forth. When he has averred those matters, he has laid the required statutory foundation for a writ of <em>scire facias.. </em>We held, indeed, in Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Sutter, 6 <em>Casey </em>53, that a claim filed under a different Act of Assembly, that of April 16th 1840, was insufficient, because it did not set forth the time when the paving was done, nor the kind of paving nor the place where it was done. But that act assimilated the claims filed under it, to those of a mechanic or material-man. The Act of 1852 likens claims which it authorizes to that of a mortgagee. The Act of 1840 did not prescribe what the claim filed under it should be. It only required that certain things should be stated <em>in it. </em>The Act of 1852 does prescribe what the form of the statement shall he, and specificalljr enumerates the averments which it must contain. It also requires a demand of the owner of the lot against which the claim is made, before any statement can he filed, as well as an affidavit of all the,facts therein set forth. It allows the- claim to be filed at any time after demand made, and it enacts that the claim shall <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>remain a lien until paid. There is very little resemblance between such a claim and that of a mechanic, and, consequently, the construction we gave to the Act of April 16th 1840, is inapplicable to the statute under which the statement in this case was filed.</p>

L. </em>488. This would be so, if the Act of 1845 had any application to this case. But it has not. This claim is based upon the Acts of April 5th 1849, <em>Pamph. L. </em>341, and April 8th 1851, <em>Pamph. L. </em>372, which made the costs and expenses of grading, paving, &amp;c., streets, a lien upon the real estate adjoining. They declared that the costs and expenses should remain a lien until they were fully paid and satisfied. They made, however, no provision for enforcing payment, or even for making the liens matters of record: To remedy these defects, the Act of 1852 was passed. That enacted that a statement of the claim might be filed, not within six months from the time the work was done, but <em>at any time </em>after a demand should be made of the lot-owner ; and it also reiterated the declaration that the assessment should remain a lien until fully paid and satisfied. These acts are utterly irreconcilable with that of 1845, and the conclusion is, therefore, a necessary one, that such municipal claims as the present are not within its provisions. If the statement may be made at any time after demand made for its payment, and if the lien be of indefinite duration, it cannot be requisite to aver that the work was done within six months next previous to its being filed. It was well said by the learned judge of the District Court who tried this cause, that the paving acts of different cities cannot be interpreted to constitute an uniform and harmonious system of laws. Nor were they intended to be such. ••</p>

The act incorporating the city ..of Allegheny declares that such ordinances as shall not be published within fifteen days after their passage in one or more of the public newspapers, published in said city, or in such other way as the select and common councils might direct, and recorded within thirty days in the office of the recorder of deeds for the county of Allegheny, shall be null and void. But on the 2d of February 1859, another Act of Assembly was passed, which, after referring to the ordinance of June 25th 1855, and to the fact that large sums of money had been expended in grading and paving under it, enacted that the omission or failure to reeord it shall not impair or in any manner affect contracts made in pursu<a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>anee of it, or any assessment, tax, lien, or claim for the costs of grading and paving done in pursuance of, and in accordance with, its provisions. The act also empowered the city, or any party interested therein, to proceed to enforce said contracts, and prosecute and collect said assessments, liens, or claims, in the same manner, and with like effect as they might or could have done,if said ordinance had been duly recorded, within thirty days after the passage thereof, provided the same should be recorded within twenty days after its passage.

It is obviously just that the property which has been principally benefited should he charged with a share of the expense of the benefit. Now it has repeatedly been ruled, in this and in other states, that the legislature may impose upon a local district a tax to pay the expense of a public improvement already made. Such laws interfere with no contract, and divest no vested rights. Thomas <em>v. </em>Leland, <a href="/wend/24/0065-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="24 Wend. 65" data-case-ids="2155261" data-case-paths="/wend/24/0065-01">24 <em>Wend. </em>65</a>, is a remarkable case of the kind. The public has a right to demand that a lot-owner shall contribute to pay for a public work which has benefited his property, and wherever there is a right, though imperfect, the constitution does not prohibit the legislature from giving a remedy. In Hepburn <em>v. </em>Curts, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20800" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="7 Watts 800">7 <em>Watts </em>800</a>, it was said, “the legislature, provided it does not violate the constitutional prohibitions, may pass retrospective laws, such as in their operation may affect suits pending, and give to a party a remedy which he did not previously possess, or modify an existing remedy, or remove an impediment in the way of legal proceedings.” What more has been done in this case ? The Acts of 1849-’51-’52 declared that the costs and expenses of paving and grading the streets should be reimbursed to the city by assessments upon the lots fronting on those streets. This was an assertion of a right in the city to reimbursement, and of a liability in the lot-owner to make it. That right is not dependent for its existence, upon the form in which the statutes require it to be asserted. Giving a remedy presupposes the existence of the right. The abstract right is no greater and no less because the work is required to be done under an ordinance. An ordinance was however required by the <a id="p58" href="#p58" data-label="58" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*58</a>statutes, and one was passed. While it was in force, contracts to do the work were made in pursuance of it, and the liability of the city was incurred. But it was suffered to become of no effect by the failure to record it. Notwithstanding this, the grading and paving were done, and the lots of the defendants received the benefit, at the public expense. Now, how can the omission to record the ordinance diminish the equitable right of the public to reimbursement ? It is, at most, but a formal defect in the remedy provided — an oversight. That such defects may be cured by retroactive legislation need not be argued.</p>

The authority given to ■the city was “to grade and regrade, pave and repave any <em>permanent </em>street, lane or alley, or sidewalk, or any part thereof.” The evidence in this case was, that First street was laid out and opened as a public street in 1830, and that it had been travelled and used as such, from that year, without interruption, until it was graded and paved, a period of more than twenty-five years.' No objection to its use had ever been made. This was sufficient, in the first instance, to raise the presumption that the public had a right of passage over it. The defendants, however, requested the court to charge the jury that “if the street was opened for.his own convenience or profit, by a tenant renting the land as an enclosed pasture-field from, and holding under Mr. Croghan, or Mr. Denny, as the executor, of O’Hara, by virtue of a twenty-one years’ lease, expiring about the year 1851, and during the minority of Mrs. Schenley, the owner, who was before her majority, and is yet under the disability of marriage, and residing beyond seas, it is no such dedication as would divest her rights in favour of the public, or render her, or the property through which it passes, responsible in this suit.”</p>

It did not legitimately arise from the evidence. It was not in proof upon what terms and conditions Garrard, the alleged tenant, held the land. It was not proved, who opened the street, or by what authority it was done. For aught that appeared, it may have been opened under process of law. But if not, if it was opened by the tenant, at his own instance, in the year 1830, the court could not have charged <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>as was requested. That a tenant for years cannot bind his reversioner, by a dedication to public use, must be admitted, but it is not to be maintained, that a married woman may not dedicate her land for a public highway. Joining with her husband, she may convey, and, therefore, a dedication, which is but a limited conveyance, may be presumed against her and her husband. Nor is it necessary to a dedication, that there has been twenty-one years of adverse enjoyment, though it is to the presumption of a grant, when time alone is relied upon to raise it. Wherever there is an actual giving of land for a public highway, accepted by the public, though there be no deed, the dedication is complete. The period of twenty-one years of enjoyment, after which a presumption of a grant is made, is fixed from analogy to the statute of limitations; and for the same reason, for which it is not permitted to add coverture to infancy, in order to avoid the running of the statute, must the fact of Mrs. Schenley’s coverture after the expiration of Garrard’s lease, be of no consequence. The facts of the case, as proved and assumed by the defendants, are, that the street was opened in 1880, and devoted to use as a public highway. Grant, that the dedication did not then bind Mrs. Sehenley. The street continued open and in constant use until 1851, when the tenant’s term expired. Then, instead of disavowing what he had done, instead of closing the street, and resuming her rights as the reversioner, she permitted the street to remain open and used by the public, four or five years longer, until after the grading and paving had been done, until after the costs and expenses had been incurred, and never, until the trial of this cause, has she pretended that it was not a permanent street. Under these circumstances, we cannot doubt, that the jury should have presumed a valid dedication, and that the court was right in so instructing them.</p>

It was not for the court to say, as matter of law, that it enhanced the cost of the work; and even if it did, the contract would not have been void on that account. The city was under no obligation to do the work by contract. It might have hired men to do it by the day. It could not, indeed, assess upon the lots more than the actual expenses were, and the lot-owner would not be liable for more than reasonable expenses. But in the absence of fraud or gross extravagance, both of which were negatived by the jury, the measure of the liability of the lot, was <a id="p60" href="#p60" data-label="60" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*60</a>the expense to tbe city, -whether the work was done by contract or not. That expense the lot-owner was bound to pay on demand. It then became due, and of course, then began to bear interest. It was the duty of the city to collect it when' due.

How could the court say, as a legal proposition, that curbstones were neither necessary, customary, nor fit for such a work ? Common observation shows that it is usual to employ curbstones, when streets and sidewalks, or footways are paved, and that they are among the ordinary means used. But whether they are or not was a question for the jury.</p>
    <p id="b60-6" data-blocks='[["BL_60.7",60,[327,1103,1153,639]]]'>Nor is there any merit in the ninth assignment. It is not easy to see what bearing the point proposed, and which the court refused to afiirm, had upon the issues tried. Had the proposition been affirmed, it could have interposed no obstacle in the way of the plaintiff’s recovery in this case, whatever might have been the effect of a verdict and judgment upon other writs of scire <em>facias. </em>The point was, however, answered rightly. First street was a long highway, intersected by other streets. Thus the property of the defendants was divided into ten or more distinct blocks or squares. It would be inconvenient and irregular to have grouped in one assessment these separated and distinct pieces of property. They could not have been sold as one, and they were not liable as one. Nor is there anything in the Act of Assembly which requires a joint assessment of all the properties which a lot-owner may have upon any one street.</p>
    <p id="b60-7" data-blocks='[["BL_60.8",60,[329,1743,1149,287]]]'>Nor do we see any objection, under the circumstances of this case, to the mode in which the assessments were made upon these different blocks. The defendants were owners of all the property on both sides of First street. An equal assessment was made upon each foot of the frontage on the street. This was consistent with the Acts of Assembly, and not at all injurious to the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b60-8" data-blocks='[["BL_60.9",60,[328,2041,1151,384]],["BL_61.1",61,[217,382,1154,560]]]'>The eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth points of the defendants assume that the substantial plaintiffs in the suit were the contractors who did the grading and paving, and not the city which employed them. On this hypothesis, it was contended, that there could be no recovery in this action, because, for certain assigned reasons, it is thought, the contractors could not have recovered against the city. We think the assumption is without foundation. It has nothing more to sustain it, than a clause in the contract, making the time of payment by the city contemporaneous with <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>the payment of the assessments by the lot-owners. That stipulation gave to the contractors no interest in the assessments, either in law or in equity. It was wholly for the protection of the city, not to give new rights to the contractors. Their only remedy is against the city. But if the contractors are not the real or substantial parties plaintiff, the defendants have no concern with the state of things between them and the city. As lot-owners they are liable, under the statute, for the costs and expenses of grading and paving, no matter how it was done, whether by contract or not, and no matter who may have been the immediate agents in doing the wort. They have no interest in anything beyond the amount of the expenses. We hold, therefore, that the District Court was right in the answers given to these points.</p>
    <p id="b61-5" data-blocks='[["BL_61.6",61,[216,941,1154,289]]]'>It is only necessary to remark in regard to the fourteenth assignment, that the Acts of Assembly make the measure of liability of the lots, not the <em>value </em>of the work done, but the <em>costs and expenses. </em>The work may not have proved so valuable as was expected, but if there was no fraud or carelessness (and the jury have found that there was none), the city had a right to recover the cost.</p>
    <p id="b61-6" data-blocks='[["BL_61.7",61,[216,1240,1154,85]]]'>The points reserved have already been considered in what we have said respecting the several assignments of error.'</p>

We cannot, of course, say that the defendants may have been injured by its being overruled. It would seem, from the reasons given by the judge for rejecting it, that the testimony which it proposed to contradict was itself irrelevant and immaterial. If so, it was not competent for the defendants to call a witness to raise an issue upon it.</p>
