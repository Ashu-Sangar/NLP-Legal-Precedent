There was then a considerable amount of testimony on both sides as to proceedings against Phipps on this and other judgments, the situation and valuation of the property he owned.

      <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>“ The first four points presented by the plaintiff’s counsel ought to have great weight under a different state of facts, and the parties occupying a different position towards each other than they do here. If this were a naked suit on the contract, to recover damages for a. non-compliance with its terms on either side, these points might be determined differently from what we feel bound to determine them now; or if the contract for the sale of the land had been made by the testator himself in his lifetime, and the executors had undertaken to accept, or agreed to accept of the Phipps judgment in payment of it.' Here, however, the sale of the land and the acceptance of the judgment (if it was accepted), under the terms mentioned in the contract, was an entirety, one contract, made with the executors themselves, under the power in the will, and the acceptance of the judgment a part of the contract itself, executed in part, by the defendant’s taking possession of the land — recognised by the estate — sought to be enforced by the administrator, and payments received upon it. Judge Barlow, it appears, died in August 1845, and no objections were made by him in his lifetime. Mr. Biddle, it seems, had the judgment entered up, in 1848, in his name as surviving executor, and died in July 1850; and letters were afterwards issued to the present administrator, with the will annexed, and he received payments upon it. The parties on both sides have treated it as a valid contract, no one attempting to object to it or repudiate it. Had the representatives brought an ejectment for the land, and treated it as a nullity, it might be different. But taking into consideration what appears to have been done, all exceptions to the mode of execution of the contract, we think, are waived, as well as the strict technical powers of the executors to make the contract in the way they did, and therefore these points are determined in the negative.</p>

It would seem, that he was counsel for other creditors of Phipps, and it is said, he may have used this judgment as an instrument to enable him to collect and recover for them — that would make no difference, provided you are satisfied from the evidence that, as executor, he accepted the assignment of the judgment and assumed the control of it — the estate would be bound by his acts in relation to it.</p>

It was entered, however, only on the appearance or continuance docket, and was not entered on the judgment docket. Other judgments were entered afterwards in point of date, but were carried to and entered on the judgment docket — one belonging to Arnold Plumer was of this character— entered on the appearance docket on the 10th day of May 1849, and duly entered on the judgment docket, for $3100. Under the Act of Assembly of 16th April 1827, and decisions of the Supreme Court upon it, entitled ‘An Act relative to the distribution of money arising from sheriffs’ and coroners’ sales,’ and as the law stood up to the 3d of April 1843, in case of the sale of property the latter judgment would be entitled to the proceeds of sale in preference. By the Act of the 3d of April 1843, ■ entitled ‘ An Act to preserve and perfect the validity of judgments entered upon the continuance dockets of the courts,’ Clapp’s judgment was restored to its preference over judgments later in date, although, entered on the judgment docket, and thus stood at the date of the contract and assignment to the executors of Shippen, and so continued. How long it so continued, is a question raised, although not much pressed by the plaintiff’s counsel. It is said, that this preference was repealed and changed by the resolution of the 16th April 1845. If this were so, it would affect the question here just so much as this: from the 17th October 1844, the date of the assignment, up to the date of this resolution, might not afford sufficient time to make sale of property on which'the judgment was a lien, and obtain a distribution on, it of the money arising from the sale, before the 16th April 1845, and therefore it may be material to inquire into the effect of that resolution. On a careful examination of the resolution, we are satisfied it did not change the law so far as this judgment was concerned, applying only to judgments in Union and Cambria counties; and that the Act of 3d April 1843 remained in full force in Venango county, and as to this judgment, until the Act of 16th April 1849, when the provisions of the resolution were made general, and when it is admitted the law was changed, and the Act of 1827 restored in full force upon this judgment.</p>

That is, could this judgment have been .collected from the property of Phipps with the exercise of due diligence on the part of the executors ? A great amount of testimony has been given, much of it conflicting, or variant, as to the circumstances of Phipps, the value of his property, the amount of his indebtedness, &amp;c. It is <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>most probable from the whole of it, that he was hopelessly insolvent during all the time from 1844 until 1849, the time when it appears a distribution was made of the proceeds of sale of the property — so far as his general creditors were concerned. That, however, is not the question here. The question is, could the amount of the balance of the judgment assigned have been collected from his property, if due diligence had been employed in enforcing legal proceedings to collect it ? The jury will take into consideration the whole evidence as to the value of the property bound by this judgment — the entire conduct and acts of the executor, Mr. Riddle, through the entire period, from the time of its assignment down to the distribution of the money arising from the sale of it, and (we'say in answer to the 5th and 6th points) that even if the estate is bound by the alleged contract to take the judgment with defendant’s guarantee, and it was so actually uncollectable at the time, as to render any efforts to collect it, in the belief of the jury from the evidence, useless, the defendant is not entitled to a credit therefor on his purchase, and the estate is not affected by any opinions of Mr. Riddle, or agreements not to press the collection of the judgment; and if the jury-believe under the evidence that, even by the use of due diligence in enforcing the collection of the judgment, the money would not have been realized on it, the estate would not be affected here, even if no efforts had been made to collect it. With these modifications these points are answered in the affirmative; but, if it is intended to assert in these points that any <em>apparent </em>insolvency differing in fact from its true intention, as disclosed to the jury by the evidence — or that efforts short of due diligence would fail of success,would relieve the estate, we dissent from what is stated in these points. A party holding an assignment with a guarantee such as this, must satisfy a jury from the whole evidence that the assigned debt or obligation was not collectable at the time it was assigned, or that it could not be collected with the enforcement of <em>due </em>dili<em>gence </em>— due diligence is the language used in the books, and means the skilful employment of all the legal means furnished by the law to enforce collection — there may be a shade of difference between that and <em>ordinary </em>diligence, the latter term referring rather to what may be customary in particular localities, and the former to what is legal every where in the state. ■ Be that as it may, <em>due </em>diligence is the language of the law, and what constitutes due diligence is á fact to be determined by the jury from the whole evidence submitted to them.</p>

It was bid off at a small price compared with what it sold for in 1848. The sale was set aside finally, it would seem, without objection on either side. In the mean time, an agreement was made, by which Phipps procured a writing, signed by two or three others, with himself, conditioned for the delivery of a quantity of pig metal to Mr. Riddle, together with J. W. Howe, Esq., who was attorney for a portion of the creditors of Phipps, which would seem to have failed in its performance, and nothing was realized from it. We are asked in the 7th point to charge that the fact of the sale in 1844, and its remaining undisposed of until 1848, relieved the- estate from responsibility in pursuit of the assigned and guarantied debt. It is a fact to be taken into consideration by the jury, in connexion with all the other evidence in the cause, whether the debt was collectable or not out of the property bound by it, and as to the value of the property bound, but is not conclusive of the result claimed in this point.</p>
