If the execution of the deed to Traynor had followed, instead of preceding the assignment for the benefit of creditors, the conveyance of the 17,th of December 1831, would have passed no title to Traynor, because the right to reduce his wife’s choses in action to possession would have passed to his assignees; but having been perfected one week before the assignment, no portion of the wife’s estate, not at that time converted to his own use, was in any way affected by it.</p>

But from the fact that for four years after it was known the estate was in her hands, no attempt was made to make good any demand against it, the accountant, during this period, could regard herself as acting only for those who stood behind an alleged creditor who took no steps to prove his claim.</p>

The soundness of this ruling is the first point to be considered.</p>

There are his receipt of 9th December 1839 for $300 of it, and the report of Joseph A. Clay, as auditor of the account of Gavin’s executor, finding that the whole sum of $500 had been paid to Donnelly. The audit of Gavin’s estate took place in 1849, after Donnelly’s death, and Mrs. Donnelly contested the executor’s right to a credit for the payment of the money to her husband. The Traynor deed of 10th of December 1831, if of any validity, was in full operation at that time, and Mrs. Donnelly was represented before Mr. Auditor Clay by counsel; yet the decision was against her, and was acquiesced in. It was held to be good payment by Gavin’s executor to Donnelly, and the credit *was allowed. Now what wms this but a legal adjudication of the fact again drawn in question here ?</p>

On this hypothesis, Gavin’s executor paid it in his own wrong, and should not have had the credit claimed. Yet the law in 1849 adjudged the payment valid. From that decree no appeal was taken, and it is not to be reversed collaterally. If the decision of the court, now under review, were permitted to stand, we should have on record twro inconsistent decrees in respect to this fund: one, that it was well paid to Donnelly; the other, that <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>he had no more right to receive or meddle with her property derived from her father than the most entire stranger.</p>

It appears, that when Donnelly made that settlement in 1831, he was largely indebted, and that the debt of Robinett, Pollard &amp; Co., which is the subject of the present controversy, was in.existence at that time. Just a week after the date of the deed to Traynor, Donnelly made an assignment of his own property for the benefit of his creditors, stipulating for releases on their part. Robinett, Pollard &amp; Co. released and came in under the assignment, but discovering after-wards that the assignment was fraudulent, they instituted suit against Donnelly on their • original claim. This suit was commenced 25th September 1835, in the District Court, and, though not tried until 1848, resulted in favour of the plaintiffs, and thus overthrew the assignment as fraudulent. The deed to Traynor, acknowledged the day of its date, was not recorded till the 5th of October 1835, almost four years after it was made, and ten days after the suit of Robinett, Pollard &amp; Co. had been commenced.</p>
    <p id="b187-7" data-blocks='[["BL_187.7",187,[218,1265,1157,247]]]'>These facts, in the absence of all proof that the deed of settlement was ever delivered to Traynor, or that he acted under it, doubtless, led Mr. Clay, in 1849, as they did Mr. Perkins, in 1854, to set it aside as fraudulent and void. Mr. Perkins had, moreover, the additional fact, sworn to by Mrs. Donnelly herself, that there was no settlement.</p>

We are not prepared to say, that this chose of the wife would not have passed under the deed of assignment, had it been fair and valid; for we have not been furnished with a copy of the assignment, and under our decisions, which are hard to reconcile on the point, the terms of the instrument would need to be looked at; but surely it is competent for creditors to question a post-nuptial settlement, made by a man deeply indebted and on the eve of a bankruptcy, judicially ascertained to have been fraudulent; and that, too, when the pnly purpose of setting up the settlement is, to prove that money actually received by the husband from the wife’s estate was not reduced into his possession. The creditors have to look to his estate for satisfaction, and if in law and fact, this money became a part of his estate, they have a right to follow it. But he did reduce it to possession, and it consequently became a part of his estate, unless the settlement of 1831 was valid. Two very competent auditors have found that it was not valid; the wife herself swears there was no settlement; the circumstances attending it are of the most condemning character, and yet the court below held it sufficient to balk the pursuit of creditors. Before the auditor, Mrs. Donnelly seems not to have put her claim to the <a id="p188" href="#p188" data-label="188" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*188</a>money on that deed at all. On the contrary, she swore that she kept the money, that her husband did not handle it, and that her guardian (by whom I understand her to mean her trustee) was dead at the time. We have not seen the deed, and do not know whether the trusts in it survived the -trustee or not; but it is very singular, that whilst the money is denied to the creditor and given to the wife, by virtue of that deed, she claimed it on the ground not of the deed,-but. of her personal custody and, handling of it.</p>

It was said in the argument of that case, that Brown <em>v. </em>De Tastet, 4 <em>Russ. </em>126, was the only case in which such an investigation had been attempted, and that there it was eventually abandoned. . It wras insisted, that the rule had become firmly established, that whenever a trustee, who is in trade, mixes and uses trust-moneys in his business, he shall be charged with interest, the rate whereof, not exceeding five per centum per annum, is to be governed by all the circumstances of. the case. But after reviewing all the cases, and discussing with great animation, the alleged difficulties of the investigation, his lordship concluded, that if a trustee mixes trust-funds with his private moneys, and employs both in trade or adventure of his own, the <em>cestui que trust </em>may, if he prefers it, insist on having a proportionable share of the profits, instead of interest on the amount of trust-funds so employed.</p>

Even where no such extra profits have been made, the <em>cestui que trust </em>is, in general, at liberty to charge the trustee who has allowed the trust-money to be employed in trade, with interest at five per cent., that being the ordinary rate of interest paid on capital in trade. This right depends on principles the same, or nearly the same, as those which enable the <em>cestui que trust </em>to adopt the investment, and take the profits actually madé.” This decision was pronounced in 1852, and may be regarded as expressing the final conclusions of the English Chancery on this interesting question. Where profits are made, and the <em>cestui que trust </em>claims them, they are to be ascertained, notwithstanding the difficulties of the investigation. And if hardship occasionally happen from an application of the rule, the wrongdoer will have no right to complain. If he dread the application of the rule, the better for the trust, for he will be more likely to administer it according to law.</p>

Ch. </em>725, the present Master of the Rolls said, — “ If, in addition to this, he has employed the money so obtained by him in trade or speculation, for his own benefit and advantage, he will be charged, either with the profits actually obtained by him from the use of the money, or with interest at five per cent, per annum, and also in the yearly rests, that is, with compound interest. The principle on which the court charges an executor with profits which have actually arisen from the property of the <em>cestuis que trust </em>employed by him, is obvious, and of general application, when such profits are found to have been made. It was the money of the <em>cestuis que </em>trust, and they are entitled to receive the profits that are earned.”</p>
    <p id="b192-7" data-blocks='[["BL_192.8",192,[308,2138,1151,217]],["BL_193.1",193,[214,401,1148,331]]]'>In McDonald <em>v. </em>Richardson, 5 <em>Jurist </em>(N. <em>S.) </em>9, V. C. Stuart, after reviewing the cases of Freeman <em>v. </em>Fairlee, Docker <em>v. </em>Somes, and Palmer <em>v. </em>Mitchell, says, — “ Where an executor employs assets in carrying on trade, without any authority, he is bound to account for and pay over all the profits, or he may be charged <a id="p193" href="#p193" data-label="193" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*193</a>with interest, at the option óf those beneficially entitled to the assets misemployed.. This is a right personal against the executor.” The same doctrine is applied by the same learned judge, in the same way, in the case of Townend <em>v. </em>Townend, <em>Id., </em>506, and a similar rule as to the profits derived by a trustee <em>ex </em>maleficio, was applied to a member of a corporation, in relation to the purchase of their debentures, in the case of Bowes <em>v. </em>City of Toronto, 11 <em>Moore P. C. C. </em>463.</p>
    <p id="b193-5" data-blocks='[["BL_193.6",193,[213,743,1148,169]]]'>It is clear, therefore, that ‘the general rule laid down by my Brother Woodward is not only sound law, but the undoubted law of this state, and is founded in common sense, common honesty, and common justice.</p>
    <p id="b193-6" data-blocks='[["BL_193.7",193,[212,914,1149,299]]]'>This decides the real question in this case, and upon a careful examination of the opinion of Justice Woodward, I find no reason to differ from him in any of his conclusions. This cause was argued originally with great force, and every care was bestowed by both sides on the argument upon the rehearing; but seeing no reason to change the decree already made, it must stand as the final judgment of this court.</p>
    <p id="Aas" data-blocks='[["BL_193.8",193,[1032,1257,281,33]]]'>Decree affirmed.</p>
