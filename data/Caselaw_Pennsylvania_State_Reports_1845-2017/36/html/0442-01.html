It was given in pursuance of the 28th section of the Act of 29th March 1832. The proceedings under that section are the same as those under the 22d, and the court will not defeat the object of the parties on a mere technicality: Kirkpatrick <em>v. </em>McDonald, <a href="/nc/46/0393-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Jones 393" data-case-ids="8682663" data-case-paths="/nc/46/0393-01">1 <em>Jones </em>393</a>.

The decree and the bond under it show this and nothing more. The result was, that to the three sureties of the first bond, there were added, by a second bond, two others; and the whole five are all alike bound for a full performance of all the guardian’s duties. A careful examination of the case makes this quite plain. It follows, of course, that all are alike bound to supply the defaults of their principal: <em>Theobald on Pr. and </em>Surety, § 287 ; and the case of Smiton <em>v. </em>Miller, 3 <em>Ross’s Leading Cases </em>42, shows this. That case is just like this, except that the new surety there was not given in court. It follows further, that, as none of the sureties appear in the ease stated to be insolvent, each is bound for one-fifth : Theobald, § 282.</p>
    <p id="b444-5" data-blocks='[["BL_444.6",444,[353,1036,1173,460]]]'>There is no difficulty about the form of the action. The sureties in the first bond paid the whole, and equity subrogates them to the rights of the wards, so far as to allow them to use the second bond to enforce contribution. It was not in law satisfied by the payment by the other sureties, and equity allows them to sue on it. Even if all the sureties had been in' one bond, the paying sureties could now, by the law of England, sue their co-sureties on it, in the name of the obligee, and recover contribution: Act 29th July 1856, § 5 ; 3 <em>Ross’s Leading Cases </em>945. We need-not say how this would be with us. The plaintiffs are entitled to recover one-fifth from the defendant.</p>
