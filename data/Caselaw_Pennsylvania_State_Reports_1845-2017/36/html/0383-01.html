The executors, after a thorough search amongst the papers of Davis, cannot find it. If the existence and destruction of the papers is made out, the jury will ascertain, from the other evidence, what was the nature of the conveyances. Did Davis convey the land in dispute to Jacob Barneord and Rebecca his wife, and to their heirs and assigns for ever ? and were they delivered ? A delivery to the wife of the first deed was a delivery to the husband. The plaintiff says, that if these facts are established, this estate became vested in Jacob Barneord, and he could not thereafter destroy, surrender, or revoke the deeds, without the consent of the creditors, unless he left other property sufficient to pay these debts; and that this creation and destruction of deeds was intended to prevent the recovery of the plaintiff’s judgments. Thus, the first deed, if established, was made 14th January 1853, and delivered in the spring of 1856; the judgments were entered 3d April 1854. In the fall of this year, the husband announces the destruction of the deed; <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>another is made and delivered in September or October; the sci. <em>fas., </em>issued 19th November 1856, were served 29th November 1856; then the second deed disappears; and the last one comes upon the stage 14th April 1857, and judgments of revival are entered 4th June 1857.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.6",386,[317,594,1155,1069]]]'>“ The answer to this is, that the deeds were revoked by all the parties thereto, and that they had the right to do so. If the first deed was made 14th January 1853, conveying the estate to Jacob Barncord and Rebecca his wife, and their heirs, then they took by entireties, and if it was delivered in the spring of 1856, then the estate vested from the date of the deed, and when this plaintiff entered his judgment 3d April 1854, it was a lien on the land, and as that lien was continued, the title conveyed by the deed to Barncord, passed by the sheriff’s deed to the plaintiff, and he must recover. The subsequent movements of Barncord and his wife cannot affect his rights. If you should believe that the second deed only is established, I mean the one testified to by Rowe, as made in September or October 1856, although the judgments were not then a lien, the <em>sei. fas. </em>having issued in November 1856, yet if it conveyed the land to Jacob Barncord and wife, and their heirs and assigns, and it was in your opinion destroyed to prevent plaintiff from obtaining a lien upon the land, and thus securing his money, the plaintiff will be entitled to recover. The sale conveyed all the interest of Jacob Barncord to the plaintiff, and if this second deed is established by the evidence, then the estate was vested, and the defendant Barncord could assent to no act which would take the land from his creditors, unless he left other sufficient property for- the payment of his debts; on this point there has been no evidence offered; but there remains due to the plaintiff, on the judgments, something above $1000.</p>

Let it be granted. Did the title vest before the delivery ? The learned judge said it vested from the date of the instrument. In this we cannot agree with him. Had there been a contract of <a id="p389" href="#p389" data-label="389" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*389</a>purchase, or an equity of any sort pre-existing in Barncord, the law would, in hehalf of creditors, carry back the delivery by relation to the date of the deed; in other words, a judgment against a party having an equitable interest in lands opens to take in the legal title when that vests in the debtor. But it must be remembered, that Barncord had no interest whatever in the land till the deed conferred it; and surely that could confer no interest till it was delivered.</p>
    <p id="b389-6" data-blocks='[["BL_389.6",389,[180,737,1157,514]]]'>Delivery is essential to the effect of every deed, and most of all of this deed, which, though made to the debtor and his wife, was not designed, apparently, for the benefit of the debtor or his creditors, but for the use and benefit of a married woman. Had Davis been properly advised, he would have known, that he could convey a separate estate to his daughter, which the Act of 1848 would protect from the husband’s creditors. But he probably thought it was necessary to introduce Barncord’s name into the deed, to make his bounty to his daughter-effectual. The deed vested an estate in both from the time of its delivery, but only from the time of delivery, and as that was two years subsequent to the original judgment, it was not bound by that judgment.</p>
    <p id="b389-7" data-blocks='[["BL_389.7",389,[178,1250,1159,515]]]'>Barncord returned from the West in September 1856, and in a quarrel with his wife she tore this deed into pieces. A new deed, similar to the first, was prepared, executed and delivered in September or October 1856. This deed was delivered to Barncord, but the interest it vested was not bound by the lien of plaintiff’s judgment, for the same reason that applies to the former deed. Sometime after this, all parties agreed to a surrender of this deed to the grantor, and he then, on the 14th April 1857, executed a conveyance directly and exclusively to his daughter, her heirs and assigns. Such was the state of the title, when the judgment of 1854 was revived in June 1857, and such was the state of it when the levy and sale were made.</p>
    <p id="b389-8" data-blocks='[["BL_389.8",389,[176,1765,1160,590]]]'>Now, undoubtedly, the surrender of the second deed by Barncord would be fraudulent and void as against any creditor, whose lien attached whilst the title was in him, but we ¡have seen that no lien attached during that time. It would he fraudulent also, as to creditors in general, if the object and purpose of it were not to secure the title to his wife, agreeably to the original intention of the grant <em>or. </em>But if such were the object of the surrender, it cannot be treated as fraudulent, because, by the Act of 1848, “property which shall accrue to any married woman, during coverture, by will, descent, deed of conveyance, or otherwise, shall not be subject to levy and execution for debts and liabilities of the husband.” Whatever was necessary to effectuate the objects of the Act of 1848, in respect to property accruing to her, could not be void under the statute of Elizabeth.</p>
    <p id="b390-5" data-blocks='[["BL_390.5",390,[311,376,1155,939]]]'>
      <a id="p390" href="#p390" data-label="390" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*390</a>The distinctions here are a little nice, and, therefore, should be carefully stated. We guard the rights of creditors against all concealments and conveyances by the debtor, which tend to hinder and delay his creditors. Such conveyances, however formal, and however valid as between the parties, are void as to the creditors of the grantor, and a parol surrender of an existing title would be readily set aside in behalf of creditors. But why ? In order, I answer, that the creditors may have the benefit of the debtor’s estate in the land. But an estate accruing to a married woman since the Act of 1848, is hers exclusively, and is not subject to her husband’s debts. His creditors are peremptorily forbidden to seize such an estate. How can they be defrauded then by his surrender, of a deed made for his wife’s benefit ? Had there been no surrender of that deed, if Barncord held it still, it would have been competent for his wife to show that her father gave her the land because she was his daughter; that no consideration moved from her husband to her father, and that the husband held merely as her trustee. Whilst creditors are to be protected against all attempts of debtors to shuffle their property out of sight, married women are equally entitled to the panoply of the statute, as against the creditors of debtor husbands. ■ In a word, creditors are to look to the husband’s estate for satisfaction, and not to the wife’s.</p>
    <p id="b390-6" data-blocks='[["BL_390.6",390,[310,1316,1154,344]]]'>And to determine the equitable ownership, we always inquire into the consideration of the deed. If Barncord had bought this land with money of his wife, and taken the deed in his own name, he would have been treated as her trustee, and his creditors would have been restrained from seizing-it. No less was he trustee whilst he held the second deed of Davis, if that was made as a gift to Mrs. Barncord. And a surrender of his trust, even by parol, would conclude him and others claiming under him.</p>
    <p id="b390-7" data-blocks='[["BL_390.7",390,[311,1659,1155,502]]]'>If the deeds were made to Barncord and wife, on no other consideration than as an advancement to the wife; and if Barncord consented to the surrender and cancellation of the second deed, the better to enable his wife’s father to convey the estate directly and exclusively to her; and if the third deed was made in execution of the parental intention to advance the daughter, then we say that neither the husband' nor his creditors are competent to impeach the transaction. Jn all this, there was no fraud, legal or actual, upon creditors. On the other hand, they would perpetrate a grievous fraud upon the rights of a married woman, if permitted to convert her estate, so assured, to the payment of her husband’s debts.</p>
    <p id="b390-8" data-blocks='[["BL_390.8",390,[314,2169,1153,175]],["BL_391.1",391,[189,396,1166,564]]]'>We do not trouble ourselves with the difiicult question, whether, since the Act of 1848, husband and wife, under a deed to them jointly, take by entireties or by moieties, for, until the cause is tried upon the questions of fact which we have indicated touching <a id="p391" href="#p391" data-label="391" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*391</a>the consideration of the several conveyances made by Davis, we shall not be satisfied that Barneord had any interest whatever in the land. The plaintiff was bound, both as creditor and purchaser, to take notice of the wife’s equities, for neither when his judgment was obtained, nor when it was revived, nor when his execution issued, had Barneord any trace of a title. The only ground the plaintiff has to stand on is, that Barneord, having had an interest, disposed of it in fraud of creditors, and that leads to the inquiry into the consideration, when, if it turns out, as we suppose it will, from what is before us, that from first to last, nothing was intended except a parental gift to a married woman, the plaintiff took nothing by the sheriff’s sale, and had no right to a verdict and judgment in his^favour.</p>
    <p id="b391-6" data-blocks='[["BL_391.6",391,[195,956,1161,344]]]'>The action was brought against Barneord and wife, but on the trial her name was stricken out, on motion of the plaintiff’s counsel. Under the statutes of amendment, we think the court had the right to allow this motion. But' the question in the cause was not changed by this amendment. Barneord could defend his possession under the title of his wife. We have always held, that the husband’s possession of the wife’s separate estate, whether real or personal, was lawful, and not a circumstance indicative of fraud.</p>
    <p id="b391-7" data-blocks='[["BL_391.7",391,[324,1344,1031,76]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>is awarded.</p>
