Watts &amp; Co. various bills of goods; that the firm was composed of E. Watts and J. M. Little; that Watts was in New York, on the 9th September 1854; and that the clerk sold the goods sued for to E. Watts &amp; Co.

Watts, that he took out of the Pittsburgh post-office, three days before the goods arrived, a letter, post-marked New York, containing the bill of the goods, headed “ E. Watts bought of Clarke &amp; West,” for the purpose of showing to whom the goods were sold and credit given, and as tending to show notice of the dissolution of the partnership. The plaintiffs objected to this, offer as irrelevant and incompetent; and the court admitted the evidence as “tending to show' to whom the goods were sold and credit given; but not as evidence to show notice of a dissolution of the partnership.” To this ruling, the defendant excepted.</p>

Watts alone was over the door; that the goods were received by E. Watts, and sold by him; that J. M. Little had no interest in the store, and received none of the goods or of the proceeds of them; and that notice of the dissolution of the firm of E.

Watts &amp; Co., and that the goods sold on the 9th September 1854, were sold to the firm, it appeared that they were purchased by E. Watts alone, and were charged to him. The defendant, Little, then offered in evidence articles of agreement, showing a dissolution of the firm of E. Watts &amp; Co., on the 15th July, 1854, which was rejected by the court, upon the ground that he did not propose to follow up this evidence by proof of notice of the dissolution to the plaintiffs, before the present debt was contracted. In this we think the court erred, particularly as there was at least some evidence to go to the jury, from which notice of a dissolution so long before might be inferred or presumed.</p>
