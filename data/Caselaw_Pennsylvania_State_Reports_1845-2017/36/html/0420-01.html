MeEnally, an execution-creditor of the defendant, was permitted to interplead and take defence; and an issue was awarded to try : 1. Whether any debt, and how much, was due from Pfoutz to the plaintiff, when this suit was brought ? 2. Whether, at the time of commencing the suit, Pfoutz was liable to be sued by foreign attachment?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="AX-" data-blocks='[["BL_420.9",420,[285,1203,1154,342]]]'>James M. Pfoutz, the defendant, had been for several years a resident of Clearfield county; for about two years before this suit was brought, he had resided with his family, at Ansonville, where he kept a store. In the spring, or early part of the summer of 1856, he failed; and executions were issued against him, and levied upon his personal property. He claimed certain goods, not amounting to $300, under the exemption law, which were appraised and set apart to him by the sheriff.</p>

'Before starting, he packed up his goods in boxes, with the exception of his furniture, and left them in his dwelling-house; he left the key in charge of a neighbour, telling him that it was his intention to take his family to his mother-in-law, in Chambers-, burg, and leave them there, while he went to the West to look for a situation; that he would return in five or six weeks, and remain at Ansonville until fall, and then he would go West.</p>

What acts are required to make a citizen of the state a non-resident? And was Pfoutz a non-resident on the 19th of June 1856? The Act of 1836 does not create any new definition of what is to be understood by residence and non-residence. It adopts words or language as they have already been defined. We may, therefore, look for authority to the decisions, made either before or since 1836, defining what acts are requisite to make a citizen a nonresident.</p>

When Pfoutz left Ansonville in June, doubtless, the intention to remove existed, and he left with that intention, but it was an intention to remove at a future time, viz., after he had found a situation, and returned to Ansonville, and lived there with his family till fall. He did not intend to make that journey a permanent removal; and there is no evidence to sustain such an assertion. If mere intention were sufficient, it must be the intention of immediately making a permanent removal, by the journey the person is then taking.' Going to hunt a location with the intention of returning and making a permanent removal at a future time, is not enough.</p>

    <p id="b422-9" data-blocks='[["BL_422.11",422,[302,1356,1153,936]]]'>An execution-creditor was allowed to intervene and raise the question. The defendant had been residing some years in Clear-field county. In June 1856, he packed up his goods, and left them in the care of a friend; and on the 15th June, started with his family, to leave them in the care of his father or his mother-in-law, in'another part of the staté, while he should go West to look for a neiv residence, intending to be back in four or five weeks. On the 19th, the attachment issued, and was served on the 20th, on goods already in the sheriff’s hands on a prior execution. He did return with his family in four or five weeks, remained a short time, and then removed to some western state. On this evidence that court charged, that he was non-resident and absent,-“if he left in June with the intention to remove to the West.” The meaning of this is, that if a resident leave his place of abode, and go into another state to seek another residence, ho thereby becomes a non-resident. This is erroneous. Residence is, indeed, made up of fact and intention; that is, of abode -with intention of remaining. But it is not broken by going to seek another abode; but continues till the fact and intention unite in another abode elsewhere. He remained a resident of this state until he left the state with his family on his way to a new home elsewhere: see <em>Westlake's Private International Law </em>36, 37.</p>
