Lytle by entering bail for stay of execution on a judgment for $4619.82, for the purpose of securing and saving harmless the said Andrew P.

    <p id="b133-7" data-blocks='[["BL_133.9",133,[244,990,1153,548]]]'>By the Act of 1848, the common law was altered in two particulars : 1. The marital rights of the husband as to her property were taken away and given to the wife. 2. The husband was deprived of the power of sale and transfer of the property of the wife, unless she joined in the sale and transfer. But the clear reading of the statute is, that if she and her husband united in the transfer, then they could pass the title. To say they cannot do so, would be to stop all alienation, and property thus held could not be sold, but must accumulate for ever. It is said, this assignment is not valid, because the consideration was to pay the debts of the husband. Such consideration contravenes no rule of law or morals; and the courts, on such ground, will hardly pronounce it void.</p>

Then, why -doubt its validity ? Before the Act of 11th April 1848, the assignment by the husband alone, in security or-payment of his debts, would have been effectual. Now the law requires her consent, and as it was lawfully given, we must declare the assignment valid.</p>

How could that avoid the assignment to their amount ? Wilson was not creditor, and Mrs. Lytle was not surety. Wilson was surety for her husband, and held collaterals from the husband, which needed and had her consent to make them valid as such. As surety he held counter-securities in his hands, given him by his principal, and there is no rule of law that requires him to give them up, because he and his principal had accepted further time from the creditor. These counter-securities -were furnished by the debtor to his surety to save him harmless, and they are not in law released by the <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>renewals or time given to the principal and surety.
