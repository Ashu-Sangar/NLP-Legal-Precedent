    <p class="summary" id="b347-10" data-blocks='[["BL_347.10",347,[189,1191,1164,515]]]'>The claim was filed on the 16th February 1856, for the sum of $347.98J, for carpenter work and boarding, done and furnished by the said John Eberly, within six months last past, for and about the erection and construction of a two-story stone and frame house of the defendants, in Safe Harbor. There was no date to the bill of particulars attached to the lien, and one of the items was the sum of $116.76, for boarding the workmen. The sum of $200 had been paid on account on the 2d April 1856, which was receipted for as “ part pay for carpenter work at the house.” The plaintiff engaged bis hands at a certain sum per day and found. The pleas wére payment, and payment with leave, &amp;c.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b347-12" data-blocks='[["BL_347.12",347,[191,1793,1162,129]]]'>1. The lien is defective, as it describes the work as done in and about the erection of the building and the appurtenances, and therefore no recovery can be had.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b347-13" data-blocks='[["BL_347.13",347,[191,1923,1162,119]]]'>2. The boarding bill of the plaintiff and his hands is not the subject-matter of a lien, and hence there can be no recovery of the said hill in this suit.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b347-14" data-blocks='[["BL_347.14",347,[192,2053,1161,75]]]'>3. No time is stated when the work was done, and this is a fatal defect.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b347-16" data-blocks='[["BL_347.16",347,[189,2225,1164,205]]]'>“ The first point is answered in the negative. The Supreme Court have decided, that a lien is not defective, if it describes the work as done in and about the erection of the building and the appurtenance, and therefore the introduction of that word in this claim will not vitiate the lien.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b348-5" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[309,401,1154,514]]]'>
      <a id="p348" href="#p348" data-label="348" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*348</a>“ As to the second point, our answer is, that a boarding bill of the plaintiff and his hands is not the subject-matter of a lien: — ■ but as the boarding of the hands was a part of the compensation which they were to receive for the carpenter work done by them, and entered into their per diem allowance, and inasmuch as there has been two hundred dollars paid in part of the carpenter work, and as there was no appropriation made by the party of this amount to any particular part of the work, you may, if you think the justice of the case requires it, appropriate so much of the $200 as will satisfy the boarding bill, and apply the balance to what you may conclude a just compensation for the carpenter work done to the building and claimed in this lien.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b348-6" data-blocks='[["BL_348.6",348,[308,913,1153,249]]]'>“ As to the third point. We think the time when the work was done is sufficiently definite in the lien; but, independent of that view, we are of opinion that under the pleadings of the case, that question could not be raised now; that the pleadings do not draw into question any technical exceptions which may exist as to the form of the lien.”</p>
