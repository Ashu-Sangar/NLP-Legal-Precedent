The 39th section of that act makes it the duty of the state treasurer, on receipt and filing the record furnished by the revenue board, to transmit to the commissioners of each county a copy of the valuation of the property of said county, and to issue his. precept requiring them to assess and collect the state tax on the amount so transmitted. This duty the law presumes the officer has duly performed, and no question has been raised on that point, and could not be, as the tax was duly assessed, collected, and paid to the county treasurer. The 40th section makes it the duty of the commissioners to cause the taxes to be collected, and of the county treasurer to pay over the same as fast as collected to the state treasurer, and the act then declares ‘ if the <em>quota </em>of any county be not paid over before the second Tuesday of January, of each year, to the state treasurer, then and in such case, the amount remaining unpaid, after deducting such commissions- as are or shall be allowed by law for' the collection of the same, shall be charged against said county, on the books of the state treasurer, and shall bear an interest of five per cent, till paid.’ The same section provides that if the money be not collected it shall be paid out of any money in the treasury, whether received for state or county tax. And if collected, but not paid over by the county treasurer, that officer is made personally responsible <em>to the county, </em>for any interest which may accrue on the unpaid balance.</p>

That the county commissioners had no control over the subject, could neither object to the amount of the obligation, the character of the sureties, or take any measures to have the same made good. Although the judges are nominally, and for many purposes, called ‘ state officers,’ yet they, like all other officers' in Pennsylvania, owe their power to the people. They are elected by the same citizens who elect the county commissioners and county treasurer. If either fail to perform their duty, the loss occasioned thereby will very properly fall on their constituents who elected them; although under the act referred to, the county commissioners could not control the amount of the bond, or judge of its validity, yet they are quite as likely as the state treasurer or the auditor-general to know whether the county treasurer is embezzling public money, and the public interests likely to suffer thereby; and could at any time have made complaint thereof to the judges of the court, under •the 8th section of the Act of the 27th of May 1841, and had the officer removed or additional bail given. The state treasurer, it is true,' has a special and limited power under the Act of May 7th 1855, but it is confined to the case of the county treasurer becoming insolvent, or the sureties dying or absconding, and even then is only concurrent with that of the commissioners. The insufficiency will not discharge' the county.</p>

It is very true, that the charge should have been so made, and in failing to make it the state treasurer neglected his duty. Schuylkill county, in the present case, was not charged until the 26th November 1858, but that will not release it from liability. We look upon that part of the act as <em>merely </em>directory, and the Commonwealth cannot suffer from the neglect of her officer <em>to </em>perform a duty of this character; <em>non constat </em>that the county suffered by the neglect.</p>

The law in force since 1834 required the county treasurer to collect state taxes, and to give bond for the faithful performance of that portion of his duty. The people of the county alone have authority to select the individual who shall perform that duty, and when selected none other can be employed. They must take care who they choose for that purpose. To our mind, there is not even the semblance of hardship in making the same persons who select the agent, responsible for his acts. It is no new duty thrown on the officer after his election; the people choose him with full knowledge that he must receive the state as well as the county funds. The liability of the county is not, however, put on that position, but on the positive words of the Act of Assembly, which holds the county responsible for the taxes until paid into the state treasury.</p>

This tax, being illegal, is claimed as a set-off in the present case. There is one insuperable objection to allowing this as an off-set; it is not proved, or even averred, that the tax, so illegally collected and paid over, was in addition to the <em>quota </em>regularly and legally due by Schuylkill county; without showing that the county paid more money into the state treasury than was legally due, there could be no pretence to recover it back, or to set it off against a legal claim.</p>

There can be no subrogation, as the debt is discharged by actual payment, and the money legally received by the creditor. When Kepner paid the money, it was in relief of his bail, which was probably his first and only object. He might have directed that it should be applied to the tax on the real and personal property in preference to his other indebtedness, but he did not. Failing to make any application, it was the right of the-receiver-to apply it. Neither doing so, the law would make the applica.tion in the same way it might be fairly supposed the parties would — first according to the interest of the debtor, but it being <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>indifferent to him, according to that of the creditor. Kepner had no interest; it was indifferent to him, as both debts were equally obligatory. The state was deeply interested, having the security of Schuylkill county for the one debt, and none whatever for the other. Thé law presumes that the Commonwealth officers would apply the money according to the interest of the state, and therefore it makes that application.

The entry might be treated as an unauthorized act of the clerk, not binding on the state unless acquiesced in. If suffered to stand for some time, it would be strong evidence of acquiescence, and binding. The receipts given, having the same dat'e as the entry, are (if made at the time they bear date, and such is the presumption unless disproved), strong evidence that the subsequent application to retailers and tavern licenses was made on the same day. Mr; Boas cannot recolléct when the receipts were given, but says that the attorney-general and Mr. Wallace, first clerk in the auditor-general’s office, told him the money was misapplied. He thinks the change was made before he gave the receipts, or at the same time. You will judge how this was, and whether the attorney-general,- on discovering the entry thus made, directed it to be corrected, and took the receipts in the form produced. He had a right so to do, if done soon after the entry on the same day; and he had a right to decline accepting receipts in any other form. The state treasurer could direct the entry to be corrected, if done at once, <em>promptly. </em>You must determine when and under what circumstances the change was made, and if done soon after the <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>entry, especially if on the same day, as the receipts tend to show, you will allow no part of the ten thousand dollars as a credit to Schuylkill county.

It was also the duty of the county officers to have the same collected, and of the county treasurer to pay over the same to the state treasurer agreeably to law. The state also had the power through its officers to require sufficient security to be given by the county treasurer for the safe keeping and paying over of such money, but the assessment and collection of a sufficient tax by the county officers will not discharge the liability of the county, provided the county treasurer neglected to pay the same into the state treasury agreeably to law, but the county of Schuylkill- can properly be charged on the books of the state treasurer, with the amounts so assessed and collected by the county treasurer, provided, the same does not exceed the <em>quota </em>of that county as fixed by the revenue commissioners, and after deducting <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>the expense of collecting, the unpaid balance must bear interest at the rate of five per cent, per annum till paid, and the county must look to the county treasurer for such interest.

But as the bond was not taken in sufficient sum to cover the delinquency of the treasurer, and has all been collected from the sureties and paid into the state treasury, there is nothing left for the county to receive, and as the county treasurer collected money belonging to the Commonwealth, which is not covered by the county’s liability, it was neither against conscience nor law to apply the money collected on the official bond to that debt, and Schuylkill county cannot have the benefit of such collection.</p>

Every part of that act points to the county as the principal debtor. After having, in the earlier sections, made provision for ascertaining the subjects of taxation and their value, and established a rate, the legislature proceeded, in the 36th, to create a board of revenue commissioners to equalize the assessments and taxes for the use of the .Commonwealth in the different counties. The duty of this board, as defined in that and the two next following sections, is to determine and adjust the <em>aggregate </em>value of property made taxable by law, in the city of Philadelphia, and in the several counties, adjusting those aggregates, so as to make the taxes bear as equally as possible upon all the property in the Commonwealth. They have nothing to do with the property of the individual tax-payer. To assist them in the discharge of their duties, the county commissioners of the several counties are required to furnish for their use “ a statement, under oath, of the return made by the assessors of the value, in the aggregate, of all the property liable to state tax in the said counties respectively, distinguishing real from personal estate.” The board is then to make a valuation of the property in each county, and make a record of it, one copy of which shall remain in the office of the auditor-general, “ as the valuation of the said <a id="p535" href="#p535" data-label="535" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*535</a>property,” that is, of the property in said county, until the 'next meeting of the board. The 39th section of the act requires the state treasurer to “ transmit to the commissioners of each county a copy of the valuation of the property of said county, and to issue his precept requiring said county commissioners to assess and collect the state tax in their respective counties, as .provided by law on the amount of the valuation so transmitted.” The same section gives to the commissioners power to add a fraction to the assessor’s valuation of each tax-payer, when the revenue commissioners increase the aggregate value of the assessable property in the county. All this looks to dealing by the state only with the total valuation of the property in any county. Then follows the 40th section, which requires the commissioners of the several counties 'to cause to be collected the taxes as aforesaid adjusted and assessed, and makes it the duty of the county treasurer to pay over the same, as fast as collected, to the state treasurer. It then enacts, that “ if the <em>quota </em>of any county be not paid over before the second Tuesday in January of each year to the state treasurer, then, and in such case, the amount remaining unpaid, after deducting such commissions as are or shall be allowed by law for the collection of the same, shall be charged against said county on the books of the state treasurer, and shall bear an interest of five per cent, till paid, and no payment shall be made to or on behalf of said county, under the various acts relating to common schools, or any other acts, or for any other purpose, until the said balance be fully paid and satisfied.” It would be difficult to find language more expressive of a legislative purpose to make the county liable for- the tax, not merely for the five per cent, interest after default in payment, but for the whole amount. The provisoes to this section confirm this view of its meaning. The first provides that if the collectors of the county shall not have collected and paid into the county treasury the amount of state tax due by said county, then, and in that case, the deficiency shall be paid out of any <em>money </em>in the treasury of said county, or which shall be thereafter first collected and paid into the same, whether on the duplicate for state or county tax.” Why direct it to be paid out of the proceeds of the county tax, if it was not made a county debt ? The next proviso gives to the county a means of reimbursement for any interest it may be compelled to pay, by giving to it recourse to the county treasurer. He is made responsible not to the state, but to the county, if the tax appears to have been collected. The forty-second section of the act declares that if. any county shall pay into the state treasury its <em>quota </em>of tax levied on its said adjusted valuation, fifteen days prior to the first day of August in any year, such county shall be entitled to an abatement of five per cent, on the amount so paid ; and any state tax remaining unpaid by any individual or corporation, after said tax is due <a id="p536" href="#p536" data-label="536" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*536</a>and payable by said county to the Commonwealth, shall bear an interest of six per cent., and be a lien on the estate-on which it is charged, till fully paid and satisfied. Here, too, the primary liability is spoken of as belonging to the county, while the means of enabling it to discharge the duty imposed are at the same time given.</p>
    <p id="b536-4" data-blocks='[["BL_536.6",536,[302,641,1158,460]]]'>Nor is it any valid.objection to this construction of the act, that the county treasurer is required by law to give bond for the faithful discharge of all duties enjoined upon him in behalf of the Commonwealth, and for the payment of all moneys received by him for the use of the Commonwealth. This was required by the Act of 1834, ten years before the passage of the Act of 1844, which directed the state tax to be charged to the county, and besides he is still a county officer, in whose election or appointment the Commonwealth has no voice, and he may be removed from office or compelled to give additional security at the instance of the county commissioners.</p>
    <p id="b536-5" data-blocks='[["BL_536.7",536,[298,1112,1161,983]]]'>The state tax upon the adjusted valuation being then legally chargeable to the county, the next inquiry is, whether the unpaid taxes of the years 1856 and 1857 could be charged to the county after the second Tuesday of January. The fortieth section of the Act of 1844 makes it the duty of the state treasurer to charge on his books against the county the amount remaining unpaid, if the <em>quota </em>of the county be not paid over before the second Tuesday in January in each year, and it is thenceforth to bear interest until paid. The act does not expressly declare when the charge on the state treasurer’s books shall be made, though it is undoubtedly a reasonable implication, that it is to be made immediately after default of payment. In this case it was not made until the 26th of November 1858, and thus the state treasurer failed to discharge his duty. But the Commonwealth is not to suffer by the laches of its agent, nor can the County of Schuylkill obtain a discharge from its liability because the state treasurer was not vigilant: United States <em>v. </em>Kirkpatrick, <a href="/us/22/0720-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 Wheat. 720" data-case-ids="1421291" data-case-paths="/us/22/0720-01">9 <em>Wheaton </em>720</a>; 3 <em>Mason </em>446; <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Pet.%20325" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Pet. 325">1 <em>Peters </em>325</a>; 1 <em>Harris </em>617. At most, the implied direction to charge the unpaid balance against the county immediately after the second Tuesday in January of each year, must be regarded as directory, and. especially ought it to be so held, when it does not appear that the county lost anything by the state treasurer’s delay, and when probably it has been a gainer thereby.</p>
    <p id="b536-6" data-blocks='[["BL_536.8",536,[296,2095,1157,302]],["BL_537.1",537,[166,400,1158,162]]]'>Nor can the fact that the bond of the county treasurer, approved by two of the judges of the Court of Quarter Sessions of Schuylkill county, was altogether insufficient in amount, either negative the liability of the county, or release it from its obligation. The liability is fixed, as has been seen, by the Act of 1844, and enough has already been said, to show that the negligence of the agents of the state cannot prejudice her, even if the judges, in taking the <a id="p537" href="#p537" data-label="537" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*537</a>bond, acted as state agents. There is the more reason for this in the fact that full power is given to the county commissioners to enforce the giving adequate security: Act of 27th May 1841, <em>P. L. </em>401.</p>
    <p id="b537-5" data-blocks='[["BL_537.6",537,[161,572,1161,1027]]]'>It remains only to add that, in our opinion, there was no error in the instruction given to the jury respecting the appropriation of the amount recovered by virtue of the county treasurer’s bond. He had collected money belonging to the Commonwealth for which the county was not liable; more than the whole amount of his bond. When that bond was paid, it made no difference to him upon which claim of the Commonwealth it was applied. Still he had a right to direct its application. It was not contended, that he had given any direction. It was, therefore, the right of the Commonwealth to apply it as she chose, either to the payment of the state tax, or to the other indebtedness of the treasurer. The jury have found that she did not apply it to the state tax. If no application was made, either by the treasurer or the officers of the Commonwealth, then the law applied it as was most advantageous for the state, that is, to the payment of the indebtedness for which the county was not liable. This is clearly so, unless the county is to be regarded as a surety for the defaulting treasurer, and such she certainly is not. She, therefore, had no equity to interpose in the way' of either appropriation. The question, however, hardly arises, because the uncontradicted evidence on the trial was, that an appropriation was in fact made, when the money was paid, and the verdict of the jury establishes that it was not in payment of the state tax. Of course, it could not afterward be changed.</p>
