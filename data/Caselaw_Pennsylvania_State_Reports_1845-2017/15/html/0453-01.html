If, at the time, there be an equitable obligation on the part of the promissor to pay—as if he have assets belonging, or is indebted to the drawer—the promise is esteemed equivalent to actual and formal acceptance, and it will make no difference that the <a id="p455" href="#p455" data-label="455" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*455</a>holder knew not of the promise when he took the bill: Fairlie-y. Herrings, 3 <em>Bing. 525; 13 Eng. O. L. B. 79; Story on Bills, </em>sec. 249.

It is clear, too, that the drawer could not have sustained an action against the defendants as acceptors, for the state of the accounts shows that when the letter of March was written the former was the debtor of the latter.</p>
