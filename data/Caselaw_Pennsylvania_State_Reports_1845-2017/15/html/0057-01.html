In a suit by the constable against the plaintiff in the execution, on his bond of indemnity, the postponement of the arbitration is not a defence to a recovery.</p>

The execution of the bond was proved by the admission of the parties, made before the justice*.</p>

These suits in the Court of Common Pleas were arbitrated, and award in favor of Cleavland for $11 damages, and $22.71 costs; and an award in favor of Jenks for $18 damages, and $26.29 costs. These awards became judgments, and executions issued upon them, which, it appears, were paid and'satisfied by Wolcott.</p>

That Wolcott, the present plaintiff, fraudulently colluded with plaintiff’s attorney to deprive him, Barber, of the advantage he had, by having the arbitration appointed to be held on Sunday.</p>

Barber, the defendant, became bound to indemnify Wolcott, the plaintiff, as a constable, for selling, on an execution in favour of Barber, property which was severally claimed by Cleavland and Jenks—who, after the sale, brought actions of trespass against Wolcott, and recovered. Those actions were arbitrated, and the day of hearing was so fixed by Barber, who chose the arbitrators, <a id="p59" href="#p59" data-label="59" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*59</a>as to fall on Sunday. Wolcott subsequently agreed to a further day ; and this is charged by Barber as a collusive injury, in depriving him of his fancied advantage in having fixed the hearing on an impossible day. But the constable had a right to manage his own-defence; the consequence being that the judgment against him would be only <em>prima facie </em>evidence against the surety, instead of being conclusive, as was said in Leather <em>v. </em>Poultney, 4 <em>Binney </em>352. If, in thus managing it, he deprived Barber of an unfair advantage, the latter has no cause to complain. He was deprived of the expected fruit of a trick, and he may not set up his own knavery as defence. ■</p>
