D. 1825, having first made his last will and testament, wherein he appointed the said Elizabeth Styer, Henry Styer, and Charles Styer, his executors, two of whom, the said Elizabeth and Henry, the plaintiffs, took upon themselves the burden of the said trust. By his said will, which was dated the 10th day of June, A. D. 1825, and duly proven and registered in the register’s office of said county, on the 5th day of September, A. D. 1825, the said testator devised and bequeathed, among other things, as follows, to wit:—“I give and bequeath unto my dear wife, Elizabeth, all my personal property, to be at her absolute disposal. Also, I give her all the use, or the rents and profits of all my lands, with the buildings and appurtenances, situate <em>in Whitpain township, </em>viz. the lot situate on Skippaek road, now occupied by John Fitzgerald; and two lots, situate on the Broad-axe road, one of them adjoining lands, of Dr. Thomas C. James, Adam Dotts, and others; the other adjoining lands of John Slingluff, Baltis Hoffman, and the said road, containing in the whole forty-five acres, (be the same more or less,) <em>during the term of her natural life. </em>I also give her, after my just debts and funeral expenses shall have been paid, one-half the yearly rents and profits of my farm in Whitemarsh township, during her natural life. It is also my will, and I do hereby give her the right and privilege of choosing on whichsoever of my farms she will re<a id="p340" href="#p340" data-label="340" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*340</a>side, and she shall have the use of a sufficiency of suitable houseroom in the buildings on whichever of my farms she shall reside,” &amp;c. And further: “ It is my*will, and I hereby direct, that after the decease of my wife Elizabeth, my daughter Mary shall have and enjoy the use and profits of all my three before described lots of land, situate in Whitpain aforesaid, with all the buildings and appurtenances, for and during the term of her natural life, (but to commit no waste or damage thereon, nor suffer it to be done by others,) and, after the decease of my said daughter, the aforesaid three several lots of land shall be sold by said trustees, or the survivors or survivor of them, who are hereby fully authorized to execute good titles for the same to the purchasers thereof, and the money arising from said sale to be paid in equal shares to all the children of my daughter Mary; but if any of said children shall be in their minority, then said trustees to place such child’s or children’s share at interest, on good security, and to be paid them as they shall arrive to lawful age,” ,&amp;e. The decedent’s daughter Mary died on or about the day of 18. , leaving issue, to wit, four children, one of whom, namely, Elizabeth, is intermarried with the defendant.

On the 2d day of April, a. d. 1840, the said plaintiffs, trustees as aforesaid, executed to the defendant a deed for the land and premises so sold to him as aforesaid, in fee simple, at which time the defendant entered into possession and paid them, the said plaintiffs, the sum of seven hundred and thirty dollars, in cash, and gave them his bond and warrant of attorney to confess judgment thereon, in the penal sum of two thousand nine hundred and twenty dollars, conditioned for the payment of fourteen hundred and sixty dollars, the balance of said purchase-money, which said bond is still unpaid.</p>

Executors can sell only at the time intended; but the intention may be discoverable, not only from the words of the power, but from the whole will. When an event turns up which the testator had not contemplated, a court is compelled to inquire how he would have provided for it had it been foreseen—in short, to suppose an intention for him where he had none—and this case presents that difficulty. What we have to do is, to apply to it the principles of our own decisions. Where the time is postponed for the exemption of a prior provision and protection of a particular person, it may be hastened by the assent of that person, as it was in Gast <em>v. </em>Porter; but where it has been postponed with a view to a probable rise in value, the persons entitled to the benefit of tlie chance may insist on having it; as they did in Loomis <em>v. </em>McClintock, and the other cases in our books. The present is stronger than Gast <em>v. </em>Porter, inasmuch as .the power was executed in conformity to the letter. The devise is to the testator’s wife for life, remainder to the daughter for life; and the power was to sell at the daughter’s death. Why ? Because the devises to them would have been broken in upon by a sale before their estates were spent. Contrary to the testator’s expectation, the daughter died before the mother; and it is not to be doubted that, though the words of the power would have admitted of an immediate execution of it, the intention of the testator, disclosed by th,e rest of the will, would not. The fee could not have been sold without the mother’s assent. But there was nothing to restrain her from parting with her estate by <a id="p343" href="#p343" data-label="343" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*343</a>an ordinary conveyance; and the daughter being dead, not only the words of the power but the intent of the testator, were fulfilled by her joining in the deed.</p>
