Kneass for a special allowance of a writ of <em>certiorari, </em>to remove the proceedings then pending in the matter of the petition to the Court of Quarter Sessions, at <em>Philadelphia, </em>complaining of the undue election of Mr. Kneass to the office of district attorney for the county of Philadelphia. The application was accompanied by an affirmation that it was believed necessary and proper that the case should be removed to the Supreme Court of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, for their decision on the law and facts of the case; that the evidence which has been taken in the court below has been reduced to writing, and will come up with the record, if the said writ is allowed; that many grave and important questions of law, under the constitution and the laws of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania arise in the case, which are of such great public interest and concern that they ought to be settled and adjudicated by the Supreme Court of this State; that the court below has rejected evidence which this affirm-ant is advised by his counsel and verily believes is material and admissible, and ought to have been admitted, and the said court has admitted evidence which this affirmant is advised by his counsel and verily believes is incompetent and illegal, and ought to have been rejected.</p>

That this case was not an exception to the general rule. The objections <em>ab inconvenienti </em>amount to nothing, for the court may appoint an examiner, and hear the case like all Chancery and Orphans’ Court cases, on the proofs. If, however, the evidence comes up with the record, as decided in Doe dem. Sadler <em>v. </em>Dring, 1 <em>Barn. Sy Cress. </em>253, the case is ready for argument. The case cited to show that the evidence does not come up with the rest of the record, is not in point, that being a <em>certiorari </em>issued <em>after </em>judgment.

In that case it was decided that “ the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court over proceedings of inferior jurisdictions specially delegated by statute, is revisory; and it is confined to the examination of the regularity of such proceedings, and whether their jurisdiction has been exceeded.” That the power of determining contested elections of county and township officers is a special statutory power, and that the proceedings can be removed, if at all, only for the purpose of revision as to regularity after judgment. No authority has been found to show that a <em>pending </em>matter under a statutory jurisdiction can be touched by <em>certiorari. </em>Even in common law proceedings, <em>certiorari </em>is not to be allowed and made operative in the midst of a trial in the court below: 1 <em>Bacon’s Abr. </em>560 ; 2 <em>SawTc.

All that was there decided is, that a <em>certiorari </em>will lie to remove an ejectment from an inferior court. See the American reprint of the <em>English Common Law Beports, </em>vol. viii. p. 69. The original report in 1 <em>B. </em>if- <em>C. </em>shows that this was the decision and nothing more.
