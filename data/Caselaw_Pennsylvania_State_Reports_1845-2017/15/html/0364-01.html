To entitle the plaintiff to recover in this suit, he must establish by evidence that the property replevied belongs to him. <em>It is admitted that Stephen and Abraham Mitchell were the owners of the land from which this timber is said to have been taken, as early as </em>1820 <em>to </em>1825. It appears also, from the evidence of Stephen and Abraham Mitchell, that between the years of 1820 and 1825 they made a parol partition or division of this land, by which Abraham was to have ten acres and the'mill, and the timber <em>fit for sawing at that time on the whole tract, </em>which contained about 147 acres, exclusive of the ten acres on which was the mill, and Stephen was to have this land and the undergrowth of timber, subject to the right of Abraham to the timber then fit for sawing, and to pay Abraham $700 for the difference in value.

That about eighteen years ago, the plaintiff improved on this 147 acres, and has occupied it ever since; and that, in pursuance of this agreement he executed with his brother a deed to the plaintiff in 1846, conveying to him this land <em>prout </em>the deed.

The timber here 'alluded to is on the </em>147 <em>acres. </em>This deed is placed on record, and <em>under which the defendant claims </em>the timber in dispute. The <em>plaintiff </em>does not pretend to claim any timber <em>that was fit for sawing at the time of the parol division between Abraham and Stephen, </em>by which the <em>latter </em>was entitled to the <em>undergrowth, </em>and under whom he claims. But he alleges that the timber now in dispute is from trees that have become suitable for rafting and sawing (if suitable at all) since that period, by reason of the natural increased growth of such trees; and for this reason he claims the property replevied. All this is denied by the <em>defendant. </em>He contends that the plaintiff’s rights are defined in his deed from Abraham and Stephen Mitchell, under date of 28th April, 1846, and that he has no right to the timber that was suitable for rafting and sawing at that date, nor even subsequent to that date, to wit, in 1846, 1847, and 1848. That it either belongs to Boults, the defendant, or to Abraham and Stephen Mitchell. If the evidence shows that the property replevied belongs to Abraham and Stephen Mitchell, the plaintiff cannot recover in this suit. But does it belong to them ? If the contest here was between Abraham and Stephen Mitchell and the plaintiff in relation to this timber, the court would adopt the general rule; which would be that all previous agreements and understandings between the parties were merged in the deed of 28th April, 1846. But this is not the present case. Abraham and Stephen, the grantors, have both been examined as witnesses to establish the plaintiff’s claim to this property replevied. They not only recognise the plaintiff’s right to it, but one of them testifies that this deed was made <em>in pursuance of the original contract </em>made many years ago. As they lay no claim to the property, hut admit that it belongs to the plaintiff, what right has the defendant to object ? He is not affected by such admission or right, if the property is not his own. The defendant’s claim rests <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>on the deed from the Mitchells to Moses Thomas, dated 24th June, 1838, under which he claims. Nor can the plaintiff go back of that. His contract and agreements with his brothers rested in parol. <em>The defendant had no notice of </em>them, <em>nor is he affected by them. </em>What then does the defendant claim under that deed? <em>All the timber suitable for rafting and sazving of every description at that time. </em>The other timber, wood, or undergrowth, as well as the land, belonged to the plaintiff, and he is entitled to the increased growth of the timber, and not the defendant. <em>The defendant alleges that the logs and lumber replevied were from trees suitable for sawing in </em>1838. The plaintiff denies it; <em>and the question for the jury is, whether the lumber and logs in dispute are talcen from timber or trees suitable for rafting or sawing at that time. If not, </em>and if it only beeame suitable by reason of the increased growth since that time, the plaintiff is entitled to so much as he has proved to be of that description, taken by the defendant and embraced in this replevin, from the 7th December, 1847, to 1st March, 1848. The evidence relating to the growth of timber, description, and quantity, referred to the jury.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b369-5" data-blocks='[["BL_369.5",369,[165,1231,1185,1199]]]'>It appears that in August or September 1847, the plaintiff noti- ■ fied the defendant to take off what timber he had in the lot in two months’ time, and forbid him taking any after that. Situated as the parties were, the plaintiff being the owner of the land and the defendant the owner of all the timber upon it suitable for rafting and sawing of every description, without any time fixed for his taking the timber off the land, the plaintiff could hasten the defendant by giving him notice to elect and take off his timber. <em>But this notice must be a reasonable one ; and whether it was so or not, the jury must decide, under all the circumstances of the ease. </em>They would take into consideration as well the contract as the intentions of the parT ties at the time they entered into it; the kind,-quality, and quantity of the timber; its locality and proximity to the stream of water; the quantity of land from which it was to be removed, and, in fact, all the circumstances that surrounded the transaction-at the time it-occurred. But it is proper to observe, that I do not understand the plaintiff as putting his claim on the ground of the notice in this case; and if he did, the jury would hardly sustain him. He claims the property replevied to be the increased growth of the timber, and, in the opinion of the court, he has a right to do so after 1838, when the deed was made from the Mitchells to Thomas, under whom defendant claims. If under the evidence, the jury find that the property replevied in this suit is from timber not suitable for rafting and sawing on the 24th June, 1838, your verdict should be for the plaintiff, for the value of it as it was when replevied.

    <p id="b370-14" data-blocks='[["BL_370.18",370,[297,1517,1164,471]]]'>The clauses of reservation of what is called saw-timber, admit of no other interpretation than as speaking of the timber as it existed at the respective dates of the deeds, and, consequently, as fixing the several claims, as the growing trees might then be found fit or unfit to be sawed or rafted, under the general understanding of the country. Were this even less clear than the language used would seem to make it, we should hesitate long to accept a construction variant from the interpretation adopted by an intelligent judge, conversant with the business habits and language of his district, and thus furnished with a key to the meaning of the parties, of which we are not possessed.</p>
    <p id="b370-15" data-blocks='[["BL_370.19",370,[300,1987,1162,213]]]'>Nor do we see any reason to question the propriety of what the President of the Common Pleas said on the- subject of notice. In this case, however, it was truly observed to be of little consequence, as the plaintiff’s claim to recover is not based on the sufficiency of his call on the defendant to remove the trees claimed by him.</p>
    <p id="b370-16" data-blocks='[["BL_370.20",370,[1086,2201,332,42]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
