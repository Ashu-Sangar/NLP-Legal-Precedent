The three surveys were made and returned by the same deputy surveyor. The ironwood corner, common to both tracts (Martha Millard and Nathan Lee) on the west, is an established corner, and the line thence north 86° east 156 perches, to the black-oak corner (being north 84° east on the official drafts) is well marked on the ground, and is not the subject of dispute; but it is the course of the line running eastwardly from this black-oak corner that is litigated between the parties in this action. The return of survey of Martha Millard calls for a line from the black oak north 46° east 219 perches, to a chestnut-oak corner in the line of John McDaniel, and calls for the “-dead white-oak corner” of John McDaniel as a line-tree in that line. The return of survey of Nathan Lee calls for a line from the same black oak north 45|- east 219 perches, to a dogwood corner. The testimony of Abraham Straub, David Rockafellow, and John Fetterman, established the existence of a line on the ground, of the date of the surveys of Millard and Lee, running from the black oak north 48° east, which, allowing two de<a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>grees variation, the same as that on the line from the ironwood to the black oak, corresponds with the course in the return of Martha Millard, and to a half of a degree with that in the return of Nathan Lee. <em>This is the line claimed by the defendant. </em>The plaintiff .claimed to run from the bláck oak north 69f- east 176 perches, to the dead white-oak corner of John McDaniel, thence north 80-J-east 38 perches, to the chestnut oak in the line of John McDaniel, thereby introducing an additional line into his survey, and varying from the line returned, 23f degrees in the one line and 34J degrees in the other. <em>There are no marks on either of these lines corresponding in date with the survey of Martha Millard.</em>

But, in our opinion, the facts are different from those on former trial. Then it did not appear that <em>Nathan Lee was returned before Millard. </em>It now appears that it was, and accepted by the land-office one month and eighteen days previous, and it therefore becomes important to consider where the original survey of Millard was made; for, although the return of survey is strong presumptive evidence that it was made upon the ground as returned into the land-office, yet we do not consider the return “conclusive evidence” of that fact: but if the jury are satisfied from the evidence that the Millard survey made on the <em>ground was altered after the Lee survey was returned, </em>you have a right to determine where the original survey was made, upon a careful consideration of all the evidence in the cause.</p>

If, therefore, there has been no <em>alteration </em>by the deputy surveyor of “the natural or artificial boundaries” of the Millard survey after the survey of Lee was returned; if the Millard survey returned into the office was the same survey that was made or adopted upon the ground, then your verdict should be for plaintiff; but if you believe that the line N. 46 E. running from the black oak was marked on the ground for Millard <em>at the time it was </em>made, <em>and that after the Lee survey was made and returned </em>the deputy surveyor changed or altered the line that he made on the ground so as to call for the dead white oak, and the chestnut oak; and that he adopted the chestnut oak as a corner of Millard in his return, without having made or adopted it as a corner of Millard <em>previous </em>thereto, then your verdict may be for defendant. We, therefore, leave the question of fact under all the evidence to be determined by you, whether the chestnut-oak corner was made for or adopted by the deputy surveyor when he made the survey of Millard; or whether the line N. 46 E., on which there are marks corresponding with the date of the survey, is the survey actually made on the ground.</p>

So in the present case, if the jury are satisfied that the line run and marked for the Millard survey does not adjoin the McDonald survey, they may reject the call for that survey as an error or mistake in the return, because the court is of opinion that the return of the Millard survey cannot prejudice the rights of the person holding under.the Lee survey by any alteration of the lines on the ground, as the Lee survey was returned into ofiice before that of Millard.</p>

It was assumed to have been proved at the former trial, that the dead black-oak corner of the McDonald survey is a recognised monument of the Millard survey, and that the chestnut oak is a corner of it. Both are called for in the return of survey —not in the warrant; but both are clearly shown to have been marked as monuments only of the McDonald survey. The chestnut oak was marked as a sight-tree on it; but not as it would have been, had it been a corner of the Millard survey. There is not a particle of evidence from marks on the ground that a line was run corresponding with those trees; but the line claimed for the Lee survey, as the dividing one between it and the Millard survey, is distinctly marked; and both these surveys were returned by the courses and distances of it. We have then, on the one hand, concurrent returns of the same courses and distances, and an actual line corresponding with <em>them; </em>and on the other, a call for an adjacent survey. Which is to prevail ? From sweeping expressions of the judge who delivered the opinion in Hartley <em>v. </em>Martz, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20262" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Watts 262">4 <em>Watts </em>262</a>, it might seem that, except in extreme'circumstances, the calls of a survey override every thing else; but the true principle of that case is stated by my brother Burnside, in Walker <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 <em>Barr </em>44, where it is shown that the lines on the ground constitute the survey, and control the calls for a natural or other fixed boundary. Here the courses and distances called for in the return, are the same as the courses and distances marked upon the <a id="p144" href="#p144" data-label="144" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*144</a>ground; .and the discrepancy in the case is between these and a call for a particular adjoiner. There is call against call; and the line on the ground is decisive. On the principle of the maxim, <em>de minimis, </em>a very slight variance might be immaterial; but here the consequence would be a loss of forty acres; and the judge who tried the cause was therefore right in directing, the jury to go by the actual survey.</p>
