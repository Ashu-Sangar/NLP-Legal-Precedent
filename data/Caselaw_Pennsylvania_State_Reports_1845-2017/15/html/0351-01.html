In the case of the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company <em>v. </em>Northampton County, the Supreme Court decided that the bed, berm-banks, and towpaths, toll-houses, and collectors’ offices are incidents to the canal, and not liable to taxation for either State or county purposes. They are- considered as constituent parts of the canal or necessarily incident thereto, and therefore not taxable in the way proposed.</p>

It is not enough that it is a convenient possession, or that it affords facilities for carrying on the business of the company. Such property as is only indispensable to the making of profits is liable to be assessed with taxes. In this case the court decide that depots are exempt, but they describe what they understand by such depots as are exempt, to wit, the offices and places to hold cars, and such places and buildings as may fairly be deemed necessary and indispensable to the construction of the road, and that warehouses, coal-shutes, &amp;c. form no part of the construction. These are not regarded as appurtenant to the road, but to the business done upon it.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b353-5" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[153,592,1165,78]]]'>We have only to apply the rules here indicated, to the case under consideration.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b353-6" data-blocks='[["BL_353.6",353,[147,678,1173,1151]]]'>And first, the reservoirs created by the company for the purpose of supplying the canal in the dry season of the year. These, in the opinion of this court, fall within the general rule before established, and are exempt from taxation in the manner proposed. They are an inseparable incident and an appurtenance to the construction of the canal, and clearly embraced within their corporate privileges. A canal, without a supply of water, answers not the purpose for which it was intended 'by the public or the corporators. It is not sufficient to say the canal would be supplied, to a certain extent and in certain seasons of the year, without these reservoirs. The public have a right to expect from the corporation that the canal will be kept in good repair and supplied with water for business at all seasons when it is reasonably practicable. In this matter the company and the public are equally interested. It appears that these reservoirs are used for no other purpose than feeding the canal, and, although the water covers a large quantity of ground, and they are erected and kept in repair at great expense, still they are a necessary incident to the construction of the canal, and therefore exempt from taxation. If a three-story brick house, used for the residence of the collector and for his office, together with an acre of ground appurtenant, in the city of Reading, is an indispensable incident to the construction of the road, with quite as much propriety we must consider these reservoirs, by which a full supply of water is received in dry seasons, and without which the business contemplated by the corporation' cannot be carried on to advantage, as necessarily appurtenant to the construction of the canal.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b353-7" data-blocks='[["BL_353.7",353,[149,1839,1171,118]]]'>Within the same rule fall the houses and gardens occupied by the collectors and lock-tenders along the line of the canal and railroad.</p>

These buildings may be considered as properly warehouses. They may be indispensable to the making of profits, and afford facilities for carrying on the business of the company, but such property is liable to be assessed. So the Supreme Court has determined in the case of the Railroad <em>vs. </em>Berks County, before referred to. It is true these buildings are called the company’s depot, but they do not appear such as come within the description of a depot given by the Supreme Court. In the same situation I regard the coal-screens and machinery used for assorting coal, &amp;c., <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>as stated in the 8th item in dispute. Also, the shutes, slides, and all machinery used for receiving and transhipping the coal from the railroad to the canal, as stated in the 9th item. Mr. Justice Rogers, in delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court, in the case of the Schuylkill Navigation Company <em>v. </em>Berks County, observes: “That which is necessarily appurtenant to the canals may be safely left to the judgment of the managers, who are, it is to be presumed, best acquainted with what may be indispensable for the successful operation of the work.” This language would seem to cover these last three items, and exempt them from taxation. But in this case the Supreme Court have indicated no intention to overrule or change the rule laid down in 6 <em>Barr </em>73, and these remarks of Mr. Justice Rogers must be taken in reference to the case then under consideration. In the case of the Railroad <em>vs. </em>Berks County, 6 <em>Barr </em>73, Mr. Justice Burnside, in delivering the opinion of the court, observes that “ it would no doubt be desirable and convenient to the company to own extensive warehouses, coal-yards, board-yards, coal-shutes, &amp;c. But these erections and conveniences form no part of the road.” They are necessary and indispensable facilities to increase the business of the road, and to enable the company to make profits, and therefore he considers them liable to taxation.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b354-6" data-blocks='[["BL_354.6",354,[294,1336,1172,639]]]'>The 4th and 5th items of property in dispute maybe considered together. The engines and machinery used for raising the cars up the inclined planes along the railroad are a part of the construction of the road, and are incident and appurtenant to it, without which' the work would not be complete. To these constructions there must be engineers who are to he constantly in attendance, as much so as a lock-tender or a collector. They are indispensable, and it is as necessary that they should have houses in which to reside, near to the engines, in order to be ready at all times to attend to their duties. This kind of property is not taxable under the decisions of our courts; and if gardens are attached to these houses, it seems that it makes no difference. But when those houses are used as boarding-houses for hands employed by the company, in the prosecution of their regular business, with a view to profit, I consider them liable to taxation, and so decide.</p>

It is carrying the principle of exemption from taxation too far to say that horses employed in drawing the cars are so necessarily incident to the construction of the railroad as to exempt them from taxation in the manner proposed. <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>Their employment is too uncertain for them to he considered as necessarily appurtenant to the railroad in its construction. They belong more to the convenience for making .profits on the road, and may be changed from day to day, and even hour to hour, to other purposes, and cannot, under the decided cases, be permanent fixtures to the road and necessary incidents to it. This, I believe, disposes of the whole case; and under the agreement, we must enter judgment for the plaintiffs, with costs.</p>

The property mentioned in this specification is also exempt, and it is of no consequence that some of the engineers’ houses are sometimes temporarily .used for boarding-houses. This is settled in the Schuylkill Navigation case, in which it is held the toll-house was exempt, notwithstanding it was occupied by the collector’s family.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b358-7" data-blocks='[["BL_358.7",358,[266,743,1167,85]]]'>6. The collector’s and engineer’s office, in the same building, is clearly exempt, The engineer is the superintendent of the canal.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b358-9" data-blocks='[["BL_358.9",358,[262,956,1171,247]]]'>8 and 9.—Coal-screens, machines used for assorting coal, shutes and slides, machinery used for transhipping the coal, have never been made taxable in terms or otherwise, by any act of Assembly.
