    <p class="summary" id="b400-6" data-blocks='[["BL_400.6",400,[296,837,1173,986]]]'>Krause, J., charged the jury:—The act of Assembly requires that a deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors be recorded in the county in which the assignor resides, within thirty days. It appears that the assignment in this case wa,s so recorded, and that Barry, the assignee, subsequently died, and Dougherty, the present plaintiff, was appointed by the court having jurisdiction in his place. The assignment is therefore good in Dougherty, and conveyed all the property of the 'assignor to the assignee. After the assignment was made, Michael Jacoby, the assignor, executed a deed for the land for which this suit is brought, to Abraham Jacoby. There is no evidence that the assignment was recorded in Bucks county, and the deed from Michael to Abraham is therefore good, <em>unless Abraham had actual notice of the assignment before he purchased. </em>One question for your consideration will therefore be whether <em>Abraham </em>Jacoby had notice of the assignment before he purchased; <em>for as to Darrach, </em>the defendant here, <em>notice to him would avail nothing, unless there had been notice to Abraham. </em>If there was once a valid title vested in Abraham, it would make no .difference whether Darrach had notice or not. So far as the court can see, there is really no evidence in this case that either Abraham Jacoby or Darrach had notice of the assignment before they purchased. Whether they had or not are, however, facts for your consideration. The plaintiff has requested us to charge you,</p>
