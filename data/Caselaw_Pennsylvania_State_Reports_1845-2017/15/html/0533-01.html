Piper, administrator of the estate of Ferdinand Piper, deceased, filed his administration account of the estate of 'the deceased, in April, 1846. He charged himself with the amount of the inventory an'd all the estate which came to his hands. His own bond, hereafter referred to, was not included. Gray and Howes were the bail in his administration bond, which was dated the 23d November, 1844. Exceptions were filed to the account, which was referred to auditors, who charged him also with $269.10, the amount of a judgment bond and interest on it, which the decedent, at the time of his death, held against the said George W. Piper. The bond was dated February 17, 1844, and was for the payment of $234 and interest. Exception was taken to the report of the auditors as to this charge. Depositions were taken and read on the argument of the exceptions. The deposition of George W. Piper, the administrator, was one of the depositions taken and read. He said : “lam administrator of Lieut. Ferdinand Piper. When I took out letters of administration, I was insolvent; worse than five or six hundred dollars less than nothing. I had not enough by five or six hundred dollars to pay my debts. I have continued to be insolvent up to this time. I carried on the apothecary business here, and removed to Wilmington, where I followed cupping and bleeding, which was not enough to maintain me. I think I left Chester about three years ago. I do not remember the time exactly when I received a share of my mother’s property. It was some time after I went to Wilmington. I do not remember the exact amount. It was over $200, I think. The drug-shop and lot was given to me by my mother’s will on my paying $200. I received for the drug-store a little over $300, I <a id="p534" href="#p534" data-label="534" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*534</a>think. It was before I left Chester, I think in 1840 or 1841, as near as I can recollect it. I do not remember exactly the year I borrowed the money from Ferdinand—I think it was 1838 or 1839.” In a subsequent deposition ^ie testified: “ I went to Wilmington to reside, in April 1844. The two hundred dollars received from my mother’s estate, spoken of in <em>my former </em>deposition, in this matter, I received at least six months before I went to Wilmington. That money was all expended when I took out letters of administration on my brother’s estate, on November 23, 1844. The three hundred dollars which I received for my drug-store in 1840, or 1841, was also all expended when I took out letters of administration as aforesaid. I was insolvent when I took out said letters, to the amount of about seven hundred dollars. I suppose I had about one hundred and fifty or sixty dollars in money when I took out letters of administration. I also had furniture at the time, worth about thirty or thirty-five dollars. These constituted all my property, and I owed, as stated above, seven hundred dollars. This amount was exclusive of what I owed my brother Ferdinand. I was not solvent at any time after I received letters of administration, up to the filing of my administration account—nor had I, between said periods, money or property sufficient to pay the debt due my brother’s estate, or any part thereof, after the necessary support of my daughter and myself. I am still insolvent. I have not had the means of paying the amount due my brother’s estate, since the filing of the account to this time. Of the amount of my indebtedness of seven hundred dollars, I still owe about five hundred dollars, having paid about two hundred dollars of the same since I administered—and I still owe about seven hundred and fifty dollars, including the amount due my brother’s estate—and the only means I now have of making payment, consists of about forty or fifty dollars on hand, but this money is needed for the support of myself and daughter. Since I took out letters of administration, my business and income of every kind has not enabled me to do more than support myself and daughter, and pay the said two hundred dollars of my old debts. I have had no money or estate from any source since I administered, except what I derived from my business of cupping, leeching, &amp;c.”</p>

Howes were sureties. An inventory and appraisement were taken by him on the 28th June, 1845. Some time after, Piper filed his administration account for settlement in the Orphans’ Court, not charging himself, or taking any notice, either in the inventory or in the account filed by him, of his indebtedness to the estate. Exceptions being taken to the account, it was referred to auditors, who by their report charged the accountant with the amount of his bond and interest, amounting to $269; which report of the auditors, and their account, were confirmed by the Orphans’ Court, from which an appeal has been taken to this court.</p>

Piper, been satisfactorily made out? The auditors and the Orphans’ Court thought.not. Piper has been allowed to testify to his means and indebtedness to some extent in exoneration of his sureties. This evidence, without impeaching his veracity, being in a case in which he cannot divest himself of feeling, is to be received with caution and some distrust. He states that certain moneys received from his mother’s estate, amounting to $200, were received by him and all expended before he took out administration on the estate of Ferdinand. It appears from evidence recently taken, and the correctness of which is conceded, that he was mistaken in this material fact: that he was paid by Maris, the executor of his mother’s estate, $273.97, on the 2d December, 1844, which was some days after he took out administration. From the evidence, it would seem that he was indebted in 1838, but that in 1841, ’2, or ’3, he had received from the sale of real and personal property to the amount of $1400, a sum exceeding any indebtedness that is disclosed.</p>

That he appropriated the money so received to any other debt then existing, is not established with any degree of certainty. Having money in his hands sufficient to pay this debt, ought he not to be chargeable with it, to the liability of his sureties, having with their aid elected to make himself a collector, as well as a debtor. Besides the obligation to pay arising from his bond to the decedent, by taking upon himself the administration, he superadded the obligation arising out of his assumed trust. As he was b ound to use vigilance and diligence in pursuing and collecting every claim of the estate against any other person, was he to be absolved from the obligation of applying the means he had to the discharge of his indebtedness to the estate of which he was the only trustee, for the benefit of the parties interested.</p>
