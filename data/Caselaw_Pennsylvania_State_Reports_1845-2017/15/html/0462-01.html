Harmstad was called on the part of the defendant, and testified—“ In the summer of 1838, Mr. Arrison agreed with me and my three brothers, verbally, to let them have four lots on the west side of Schuylkill Seventh street, below Walnut street, at four dollars a foot. Prior to that, a talk had been had about taking them up, and giving us, in lieu of paying for them, the building of some houses for "Mr. Arrison. When we came to <a id="p463" href="#p463" data-label="463" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*463</a>the final bargain, however, he gave up building, and agreed, in lieu of it, to let us have our own time to redeem, and to let the rents begin to run from the first of January, 1839. We took on these conditions, and began to build in September 1838.” He further said that before deeds were given, Mr. Arrison recommended his scrivener to draw the deeds. That he told them each to select his lot and take a diagram to the scrivener. He did so and wrote on the diagram a name on each lot; this was about September, 1838. In February, 1839, he received a note from the scrivener. This is it. “I went to Mr.Badger’s office to sign the deed by myself, and looked over them all. They were then signed by Arrison and wife. There was no insertion of these words, ‘ within ten years from the date hereof,’ in any of the eight deeds. There was a blank there in all. On seeing this blank, before I signed, I asked Mr. Badger the cause of it. <em>He said it was in my favour. </em>There was another large blank in the deed, which he said was immaterial. I signed mine, and my brothers went, one after the other, and signed theirs. Joseph brought home our four deeds between three and four o’clock in the afternoon. Each took his deed.” He further said that, about two weeks after, he got another note from the scrivener, desiring him to bring the deeds to his office: “ Arrison desired to have them recorded. I have lost that letter. I have made search for it.” That he took the deeds and left them with the scrivener. * * * Cash’s office was in the same house, downstairs. The scrivener kept Arrison’s books. That he received in July a bill from the scrivener for six months’ rent. “I went to make an excuse that we had built largely, and could not pay the rent then. Arrison, then present, said he was satisfied. He refused to take a note I offered him. On the 8th October, 1839, I went down to pay rent. I paid rent for all the four lots, and took a receipt. This is that receipt. I then asked for the deeds. He said I could get them from Cash. I went to Cash, but did not get them then. I called next morning. Mr. Harlan put the deeds under his arm and went with me to the recorder’s office and left them there. I got a receipt. I had not seen the deeds since I executed mine. About the 20th of November, 1839, I went to the recorder and got them, and brought them home. On examining them, I found interlineations in all that we had—in all four of the deeds. These are they. These are the words interlined: ‘within ten years from the date hereof.’”</p>

A deed is a solemn and a formal act: a commercial instrument is neither solemn nor formal. A deed is not intended for circulation or to be subject to alteration by the exigencies of trade; but a promissory note or a bill of exchange may induce new responsibilities while it flits from hand to hand as if it were a part of the general currency. It is not strange, therefore, that a commercial and a common law security should have different consequences in respect of responsibilities to third persons. A fraudulent alteration of either avoids it between the original parties; but the necessities of trade require that a <em>bona fide </em>holder of a bill or a note*be not involved in the consequences of their dealings. On the other hand, the assignee of a bond, whether legal or equitable, takes it subject to defalcation and the equities of the obligor. A decision in the case of a commercial instrument, therefore, cannot be a precedent for a ease like the present. The fraudulent alteration of a deed makes every part of it a forgery; and it is so laid in an indictment. In Rex <em>v. </em>Teague, 1 <em>Eng. Cro. Ca. </em>35, and in Dawson’s case, 2 <em>East P. C. </em>979, S. C. 3 <em>Chitty Crim. L. </em>1042, it was held that a forgery of a material part is a forgery of the whole, because the legal effect of the whole would be changed; and it would seem to be as absurd to claim through the forgery of a deed not locked up in the party’s desk, as to claim through the theft of a horse not locked up in the owner’s stable. There is no case or book in which a deed fraudulently altered has been treated as only voidable. The authorities collected in <em>Shepherd’s Touchstone, </em>at page 68, prove that it is utterly void. The attempt has been made to raise an authority, implied from the defendant’s laches in parting with the possession of the instrument, to fill blanks in it to his prejudice before the ground-rent was conveyed ; but the only case cited to sustain it is that of a check, which is inapplicable to .the present. There is no instance of an implied agency to alter a deed. The case in 2 <em>Lev. </em>35 is not such. <a id="p468" href="#p468" data-label="468" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*468</a>A and B had sealed and delivered a bond to C, and the name of <em>D </em>was afterwards interlined; but he also sealed and delivered it with the concurrence of the others, and it was held to be the bond of all three. The transaction was consummated in the presence of all; and as it was the immediate act of all, there was no agency in the case. The only case that might be supposed to give colour to the argument, is Texira <em>v. </em>Evans, 1 <em>Anstr. </em>228, cited by Mr. Justice Wilson in the great case of Master <em>v. </em>Miller, 4 <em>Term Rep. </em>331; which was, however, a case of express authority. Evans, wanting to borrow ¿£400, or as much as his credit would raise, executed a bond with blanks for the name and sum, and sent it into the market by a servant, who filled it up. On <em>non est factum </em>pleaded, Lord Mansfield held it to be a good deed. Mr. <em>Preston, </em>the learned editor of <em>Shepherd’s Touchstone, </em>at page 139, expresses a powerful doubt of the solidity of that decision, inasmuch as it is founded on an assumption that a man may be bound by a deed executed in his name by an attorney not constituted by deed—contrary to a fundamental rule of the common law. That case can be sustained, if at all, only on the ground that the obligor had estopped himself by an act in pais. But it would be unreasonable and inconsistent with the current of human transactions, to require a party to keep his deed under lock and key in order to preserve it from violation. Laymen are not conveyancers, and scriveners employed by them use printed forms to save trouble; but the law would exact extreme vigilance did it require their employers to supervise the filling of the blanks. The exceptions converge to this one point; and they have not been sustained.</p>
