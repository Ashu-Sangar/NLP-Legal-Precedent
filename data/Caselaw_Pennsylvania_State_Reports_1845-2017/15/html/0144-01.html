Bostian Divel confessed a judgment in favor of his brother, John Divel, for $85. Same day, execution was issued, and was received by Hafer, a constable, and Hafer alleged that on the next day he made a levy on all the personal property of Bostian Divel, which, however, was not removed. The levy included two or three cattle. On the 15th December, Rangier brought suit on a note against Bostian Divel, and, on the 22d of that month, obtained judgment. On the same day, execution issued to Winegardner, another constable, who made a levy on the property in the possession of Divel, including the cattle previously levied on by Hafer, and put them into a stable for security. Hafer afterwards took the cattle out of the <em>stable and </em>sold them, and subsequently brought this suit against Winegardner for taking away the cattle. The levy made by Winegardner was made on th√© day before the sale by Hafer. Verdict for plaintiff, for $7.</p>

'It was in the exclusive possession of the one constable, and the other had-no right to disturb it. The right to the proceeds was determinable by law; and so far is the principle carried, that the property .of a stranger in the hands of a sheriff or a constable cannot be replevied, though the same protection is not extended to the purchaser. The reason is, that there would be confusion and disturbance of the peace if the process of the law were not allowed to run its course.</p>
