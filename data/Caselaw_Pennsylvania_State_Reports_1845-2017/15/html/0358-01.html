It was an action brought by Charles Hurst against Samuel Helfenstein, before a justice of the peace, to recover the sum of $70, which Hurst alleged was due to him under an agreement between Helfenstein and one Wells Moore, for a sale of a messuage and tract of land in Montgomery cpunty. The facts were these:—Jacob Hauss was sometime previously the owner of the messuage and tract of land. He mortgaged the property to Helfenstein for $1200 : subsequently, one John Hurst obtained judgment against Hauss for $200; John Hurst died, and Charles Hurst was substituted as administrator. Hurst, as administrator, proceeded on this judgment, and the property was sold under it. Hurst became the purchaser at the sheriff’s sale for the sum of $1500, but <em>afterwards Helfenstein was substituted. </em>Before the sheriff’s deed was acknowledged, Hurst, Helfenstein, and Hauss agreed that the property should be <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>taken by Helfenstein at the $1500, discharged of all encumbrances; <em>that Helfenstein should pay to Hurst </em>$100, <em>on account of his judgment, </em>and that <em>Hauss </em>should hold the property as tenant for three years, at an annual rent of $75, and if, at any time within the three years, he could make arrangements to buy the property at such sum as would pay Helfenstein and Hurst, he was to have the privilege of doing so. Before this term expired, and while Hauss was still in possession, William Wentz called upon Helfenstein to purchase the property. Helfenstein said he could not sell without seeing Hurst, who had a claim. After some bargaining, Wentz was referred to Hurst to arrange about this claim. Hurst agreed to take $70. Wentz then bargained for the lot, agreeing to pay Helfenstein . $1595, and also to pay Hurst. This bargain was after-wards transferred by Wentz to Wells Moore, who entered into a written agreement upon the terms above stated. This contract was not executed, Helfenstein declining to execute the deed. Hurst then brought this suit against Helfenstein, to recover the said $70, with interest, <em>being the balance due upon said judgment.</em>

But it also says, on the other hand, that if the'arrangement between plaintiff and defendant was made merely to let defendant be the purchaser at sheriff’s sale, on defendant’s agreement to pay off a certain sum on his judgment in lieu of the whole, the justice had jurisdiction, and plaintiff may recover whatever sum defendant so promised to pay him.”</p>

It was, to be sure, a lien on the land of Hauss; and as such, both parties regarded it and dealt for it. After the sale of Hauss’s estate by the sheriff, the title to the land never could have come in question on that contract—never did come in question on any account. It is true that it was agreed, as an incident to the 'purchase of Hurst’s judgment, that if Hauss in three years became able to refund to Helfenstein the purchase-money and to pay Hurst’s judgment in full, that in such case he wa.s to get back the land.
