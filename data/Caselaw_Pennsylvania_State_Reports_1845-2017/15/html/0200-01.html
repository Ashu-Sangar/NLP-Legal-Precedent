Tobacco was ordered by a firm, and was sent with an invoice and bill of the same; and a bill of exchange for the amount, of the same date as the bill and invoice, payable at a future day, was forwarded through a bank,'at the same time, for acceptance by the vendees. When the tobacco arrived, the vendees hesitated or declined to receive it from the wharfinger, on account of inability to pay. The draft was presented and protested for non-acceptance, but on the next day was accepted. The tobacco was received, and was afterwards replevied by the vendors. The vendees afterwards made an assignment for the benefit of creditors: <em>Held, </em>that in the absence of evidence that the acceptance of the bill of exchange was to precede delivery, the mere refusal to accept the bill was not an act of rescission of the contract, and if there had been an explicit declaration of refusal to receive the tobacco, the subsequent act of taking possession of it, before the acceptance by the vendors of the act of rescission, would have been a retraction of it. The character of tho transaction <em>when the tobacco was ordavd, </em>is the criterion as to the construction of the contract.</p>

It was in January 1847. I was in the habit of going to the counting-room of the defendants. A. Mullen stated to me that a lot of plug tobacco had arrived from Richmond. He stated to me that the tobacco was lying <a id="p202" href="#p202" data-label="202" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*202</a>at the wharf, <em>and he designed not taking it into store, </em>and asked my advice in relation to it. I asked him his reasons for not taking it into store. He stated his inability at that time, as he thought, to pay for it when it became due. I then asked him when he ascertained that he was insolvent, his then situation. He said they had ascertained it a few days previous, when they took an account of stock; which they had not done for four or five years before. He said they had taken an account of stock with a view of taking into partnership a brother of theirs from New Orleans, who had arrived with funds. When they found out their situation, they declined going into business with him. They then came to the conclusion it would be better for them to suspend. They then asked me my advice in relation to this tobacco, what course they should pursue in relation to it. I asked them when they had ordered this tobacco. They told me a month or more prior to that time. • I asked them if they knew their condition at the time they ordered it. They told me, no. I then gave them my advice. I told them it would be injustice to the other creditors, giving as a reason that I had sold them goods after they had ordered this tobacco. That is the amount of the conversation. I did not know when this tobacco was ordered. They never stated how long they had been insolvent. I was at a meeting of the creditors. My recollection is, the defendant said that he was crippled by the failure of Sarfcori, four or five years before. I was a creditor for $400 or $500. My claim was audited, and forty odd per cent, paid, and handed over to Heald, Bucknor &amp; Co. The conversation which I have detailed was held on Saturday or Monday. It was on the day they refused to accept the draft., Mr. Mullen told me Mr. Logan gave him money to take up a note.</p>

I promised the money by making a purchase of them, and paid them in cash, and they took up the note: it was $700 or $800. The following week I knew of similar transactions. I learned the week following beyond doubt that the house was in difficulties. It was late in the month of January or in February that I heard of the assignment. An assignment was spoken of a few days previous.

Was afterwards at a meeting of creditors. Did not hear Mr. Mullen say he had been insolvent for years. He said he had not taken an account of stock for five years, but he never intimated he had been insolvent previous. He referred to Sartori’s failure as one of the causes. His loss by it was $12,000 or $13,000. It was the latter part of the week following that I learned from defendants they were in diflSculties. I knew of their difficulties the whole week. I saw the tobacco which is in suit, in the defendants’ store the beginning of the week. Mr. Mullen and I had a conversation whether there was any real necessity for them to stop. I thought there was not. Towards the latter part of the week we came to the conclusion that they had better stop. In the early part of the week they still held the matter in consideration.

I am not aware of any law which would forbid such a resale here. Still, the English decisions are not the less authoritative on the question of consummation. The question before us is whether the sale was perfected by delivery ; and in all cases the quality of the acceptance is the test; the difficulty being in its application to cases in which the intention is doubtfully and obscurely indicated. The first of them, Atkins <em>v. </em>Barwick, <em>Stra. </em>165; S. C. 10 <em>Mod. </em>431; 11 <em>Mod. </em>295; <em>Fort. </em>353, would not stand it on the facts and circumstances stated in any of the reports of it. The vendors sent the goods to the bankrupts in the country, who gave credit for them on their books, but after-wards sent them to a third person for the vendors’ use; and, had that- been all, the judgment would have been wrong. But Lord Mansfield said of it, in Harman <em>v. </em>Fisher, <em>Cowp. </em>125, that the trader had very honestly refused to accept the goods, and returned them; and Chief Justice Best said, in Bartram <em>v. </em>Fairbrother, 6 <em>L. J. C. P. </em>128, that when the goods arrived by the wagon, the vendees .could not turn them loose in the street; they did what was equivalent to rejecting them—they sent them to a friend of the consignors for their use. Of course, they must have ascertained that the fact of crediting the consignors on the books was an error of the reporters. In every other case, however, an unqualified ac<a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>ceptance has been held to pass the ownership ; but there may certainly be a special acceptance which will not have that effect. A case may be conceived, said Lord Abinger, in James <em>v. </em>Griffin, <em>Tyrwh. &amp; Gfr. </em>449, where even a reception of goods into the vendee’s own warehouse would not be a taking of possession; as where a party, knowing that he must inevitably become bankrupt, puts them apart from his other goods, with a view of returning them to the vendor. It is unnecessary to examine the other cases, as they will all be found to turn on delivery tendered and accepted, in execution of the contract, or rejected in order to rescind it; and acceptance always stands with the contract where there is not a specific declaration of intention to the contrary. It remains to apply this test to the facts before us.</p>
    <p id="b207-4" data-blocks='[["BL_207.5",207,[140,982,1177,815]]]'>In execution of an order, the plaintiffs sent the tobacco to the defendants, their customers, enclosing the invoice and bill, and saying “ for which we will make the usual draft at four months, and which you will please protect.” They drew on the same day, but when the draft arrived, the defendants were insolvent.. While the tobacco was lying at the wharf, one of the defendants told a creditor of his firm, that they did not intend to take it into store, as they were'unable to pay for it. The creditor remonstrated, and was told they would consult the other creditors. The tobacco was after-wards taken into the store, and in a few days replevied. Whatever the defendants may have contemplated, there is nothing in these facts to show that they had made up their mind to rescind, much less that they had done any act of rescission. Nothing they might say to the witness could control their course of action. On the contrary, they postponed the matter for further consideration, and eventually, not only received the tobacco, but refused to give it back. If the wharfinger was the plaintiff’s agent, he permitted the defendant to take possession of it; and so far as actual delivery was concerned, the contract was executed.</p>
    <p id="b207-5" data-blocks='[["BL_207.6",207,[138,1798,1175,647]],["BL_208.1",208,[302,421,1174,247]]]'>The draft was presented at the same time, but protested for want of acceptance. Hence it is argued that acceptance was a condition precedent to delivery; and that the possession obtained without it was surreptitious. The plaintiffs had drawn bills on the defendants for tobacco before, but on what conditions did not appear. The request to protect their draft was certainly not a stipulation for acceptance before delivery, nor could it be. The draft did not attend the tobacco, and might have arrived long after it; so that the plaintiffs could scarce have intended that the boxes should remain on the wharf till it should be presented, or that acceptance of it and delivery of the tobacco should be simultaneous. But the draft was actually accepted the following day; and even a drawee having refused to accept generally, may accept <em>supra </em>protest, for the honour of the drawer or an endorser, and, thus secure to the holder every advantage he could have had from a general acceptance. It is <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>argued that the refusal to accept generally was an unalterable act of rescission ; but the cases require a specific declaration of refusal to receive; and even that may be retracted before it has been accepted by the vendor. Had there been such a declaration here, the subsequent act of taking possession would have been a retraction of it.</p>
    <p id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.6",208,[300,677,1173,388]]]'>Still, it is argued that the vendor may treat the sale as a nullity where there has been' a preconceived design not to pay. But there was no such design when the tobacco was ordered, and the character of the transaction, at that period of it, seems to be the criterion. The other creditors furnished goods on orders indisputably honest; and they are equitably entitled to equality of participation in the general wreck. The defendants might have preferred the plaintiffs ; but their refusal to do so is not evidence of fraudulent design.</p>
