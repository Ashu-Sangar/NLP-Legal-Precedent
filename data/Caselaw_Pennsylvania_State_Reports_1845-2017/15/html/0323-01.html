Hassinger, Henry R. 'Campbell, Thomas Weaver, Abraham Okie, Andrew D. Cash, Benjamin S. Bonsall, Jacob Heyberger, and John Miles, purchased sundry lots of ground, subject to incumbrances, situate in Ninth street, Green street, Washington street, Wallace street, and Eighth street, in the district of Spring Garden, in the county of Philadelphia. This property was <em>all </em>subject to incumbrances; and, for the purpose of more convenient partition, the titles to the respective lots purchased were made to different persons, consisting of the ten above mentioned. Afterwards, to effectuate the partition among all the parties in interest, they joined in a conveyance of all the lots purchased, to George W. Heyberger, in trust, for that purpose. In the conveyance to Heyberger, which was dated 22d November, 1838, the lot of ground on the corner of Ninth and Green streets was stated to be subject to the payment of the mortgage debt of $10,000, with interest, &amp;c. unto James Paul—no mention was made of any other mortgage upon it. Chew was not a party to this deed. In pursuance of the deed of trust, a partition was agreed upon and made. In the partition, the lot, together with the improvements thereon erected, situate <em>at the north-west corner of Ninth and Green </em>streets, was, <em>inter alia, </em>conveyed by Heyberger <em>to Peter Wager, Jonathan K. Hassinger, and John Miles, </em>their heirs and assigns, subject to the mortgage debt of $10,000 to Paul; but no mention was made of its being subject to the $5000 mortgage to Weaver. <em>Shortly after the purchase of the several properties </em>aforesaid, by the ten gentlemen above named, Samuel Chew, (since deceased, and whose executor was defendant in error,) became the purchaser of the one undivided moiety of the interest of <em>John Miles in the whole. </em>The encumbrances which, at the time of his purchase, existed against the lot <em>at the north-west corner of Ninth and Green streets, </em>which <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>had been allotted to Wager, Hassinger, and Miles, <em>consisted of a mortgage to James Paul of </em>$10,000, to which the lot was subject at the time of the purchase, <em>and a mortgage (ivhieh is the one in question) </em>executed by Peter Wager and Jonathan K. Hassinger, in whose names the title was made to <em>Thomas Weaver, </em>of whom the lot was purchased for $5000, <em>it being for a part of the purchase-money, </em>the remainder thereof, to wit, $10,000, having been paid in cash. Afterwards, to wit, <em>after the partition was had, </em>Jonathan K. Hassinger, one of the three persons above named, to whom the said lot was conveyed in partition, became unfortunate in his business and stopped payment. <em>A judgment </em>was obtained against him, and his one-third undivided interest in the lot in question, as tenant in common with the other two, was sold at a sheriff’s sale, under an execution issued to September term 1839, upon said judgment. . The sheriff’s deed conveyed the property to Chew, <em>subject to tioo mortgages of fifteen thousand dollars, c. Samuel Cheiv </em>became the purchaser at sheriff’s sale, for $55; paid the purchase-money, and the sheriff executed to him a deed-poll for the same. Deed-poll to Chew acknowledged on 9th November, 1839. Of the existence of these mortgages, Mr. Chew had full knowledge; and it was alleged that at and before the purchase by him, he promised to be accountable, in the event of his becoming the purchaser, for his proportionate share of the incumbrances which existed against the said lot, viz. in proportion to the interest acquired by him under the sheriff’s sale.</p>

      <em>After </em>Mr. Chew became the purchaser as aforesaid, the heirs of James Paul, being desirous of collecting their mortgage of $10,000, issued a <em>scire facias </em>thereon, obtained a judgment, and issued a <em>levari facias </em>thereon, under which the property in question was sold for $11,200, to Henry S. Berrill. Previous to, and on the day of the sale, Berrill entered into an agreement with the - said Peter Wager, Samuel Chew, and John Miles, to purchase the said lot in question, and some other property adjoining thereto, and which was held by them in like manner as tenants in common, for the price or sum of $13,000. The lot in question brought, as above stated, $11,200, a sum not quite sufficient to cover the amount due upon Paul’s mortgage, thus leaving the mortgage of $5000 to Weaver, the one in question, entirely unsatisfied. The sale to Berrill was on <em>plu. lev. fac. </em>to March term 1841. Weaver had assigned his mortgage, together with the <em>bond </em>and warrant of-attorney to confess judgment, for a valuable consideration, to the Mechanics and Tradesmen’s Loan Company of Philadelphia. The company were anxious to realize their money; and, to enforce its payment, entered a judgment upon the bond; the effect of which was to make it a lien against all the separate real estate of Wager. They urged Wager for payment. In this exigency, he called upon Chew to contribute his proportionate part, in pursuance of his <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>agreement with him to that effect. Chew solicited time. He did not refuse to pay the amount which he was called upon to contribute, in terms, but alleged that there was a latent incumbrance outstanding and unsatisfied, against the property in question, of $7000, of which he had no knowledge at the time he became the purchaser of Hassinger’s interest; and that, until that incumbrance was removed, he would not respond to Wager’s demand for his proportionate share of the said $5000 mortgage. He stated that, that being removed, he would pay his one-third part thereof. That incumbrance was, after much difficulty, removed, and he was called, upon to redeem his promise. In the mean time, the heirs of Paul had sold the property under their <em>levari facias. </em>The speculation had proved a ruinous one. The Loan Company pressed for payment of their judgment; an execution was issued against Wager, and Wager was left to raise the whole amount of the mortgage, together with the interest and costs which had _accrued thereon. Pie satisfied the said judgment; and this action was brought to recover the one-third part thereof. This constituted the <em>chief </em>part of the claim for which suit was brought; the <em>remainder </em>consisted of a claim for a balance due on a book account.</p>

His prior connection with the speculation, as a purchaser from Miles, is introduced solely as evidencing his acquaintance with all the features of the transactions attending the acquisition of the several properties, and not as furnishing a substantive ground upon which a recovery can be had in this action. In fact, we have no reliable account of the nature of Chew’s association with Miles, or of the terms under which he acquired an interest in Miles’s shave of the houses and lots purchased by the adventurers. He did not join in any of the deeds and agreements executed from time to time, as the associate of Miles, nor does he seem to have been formally recognised by the other parties, as one interested, until after he bought at sheriff’s sale, and then only as the vendee of Hassinger’s interest. Accordingly, on the argument, any supposed claim recoverable against Chew, as the associate of Miles, was disclaimed as being recoverable in this suit. Had it been otherwise, it is impossible to perceive how such a claim could be successfully pressed, in the absence of the information necessary to a full comprehension of the positions relatively occupied by Miles and Chew. We are then to deal with the latter only in his capacity of buyer at the judicial sale, except so far as his connection with Miles may serve to elucidate his subsequent actions and declarations, or as it may serve as proof of imputed knowledge”.</p>

This would have resulted from the mere operation of law, unassisted by any stipulation in the sheriff’s conveyance. But if any regard be due to the language of the deeds executed by all the parties then having an interest, to George W. Heyberger, with a view to a partition of the common estate, of the articles of agreement of 1839, declaring the objects of that conveyance, and of the deed made by Heyberger to Wager, Miles, and Chew, for the very lot of ground from which springs this litigation, it was the intention of the parties that, as <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>among themselves, the grantees should hold that lot freed of every encumbrance, except the mortgage to secure the payment of $10,000 owned by Paul. The first of these instruments sets out, with great and labored particularity, the several encumbrances to which the respective pieces of property named in it were tobe considered as subject in the hands of the trustee, and twice names this lot as bound only for the payment of the Paul mortgage; the agreement, acknowledged more than eleven months afterwards, after reciting the deed to Heyberger, that it was made as a mode of facilitating partition, and that the parties had since agreed upon the method of partition, directs Heyberger as trustee, <em>inter alia, </em>to convey to Wager, Miles, and Hassinger, lot No. 1, as a portion of their purpart, <em>subject to the Paul mortgage, </em>after which it proceeds to direct the conveyance of the other purparts, specifically mentioning and describing the encumbrances to which they were subject; and the conveyance accordingly executed by Heyberger to Wager, Miles, and Chew, on the 29th of November, 1839, delivered in April 1840, passes the particular lot to the grantees, as tenants in common, subject only to the single mortgage just mentioned. The agreement, which appears to have been 'prepared before the sale of Hassinger’s interest, was not executed till afterwards, and was then sealed by Chew as sheriff’s vendee of Hassinger’s share, sold shortly before. The execution of this paperwas Chew’s first formal act as the holder of that interest, and it was immediately followed by Heyberger’s conveyance. Looking to these' instruments, as finally ascertaining the rights and liabilities of the parties, it seems impossible to avoid the conclusion that, though No. 1, conveyed to Wager, Miles, and Chew, was, in fact, encumbered by two mortgages in its relation to creditors, as between the grantees themselves it was to be deemed subject to but one, resting the burden of the other upon the personal responsibility of Wager and Has-singer, who had executed it, together with the accompanying bond. If this be so, the subsequent satisfaction of it, by the former party, was but in discharge of his obligation to do so in relief of his co-tenants, and, consequently, can furnish no pretence for calling upon any of them for contribution.</p>

In the formal statement of this evidence, entered of record, it is not said the object was to reform the deeds. If such was the design, it was most loosely and imperfectly expressed, and this, perhaps, was a <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>sufficient reason for not listening to it. It did not proffer to show any thing which took place at. or about the time of the execution of the papers, or any of them, and of which Chew was cognizant. The language in which it is couched is very vague; but, if I apprehend it correctly, the offered proof was of conversations, understandings, and agreements between the original parties before Chew’s purchase from the sheriff, and to which he was not privy. This was, obviously, inadmissible. For aught the evidence discloses, he never saw the writings numbered one and two, and, although it is said that when he bought he knew of the $5000 lien, and of the terms of the contemplated division, this, of itself, was clearly impotent to work a very material alteration in the instruments afterwards executed, and which, in this important particular, are in perfect harmony with the elaborate deed of 1838. The rejected evidence was, in no single feature, to be assimilated to the kind of proof requisite for the correction of a writing. The solemn instruments executed by these parties must be accepted as expressive of their final arrangements, and, in the present position of the case, as superseding prior negotiations and parol agreements, even as between the original parties. This is the general rule, and I see. nothing to withdraw this case from its operation. Indeed, it steers so far wide of an exception, that it is not even proved Chew was connected with the supposed prior arrangements and assented to them as a purchaser at the judicial sale.</p>

Had the deeds expressly subjected the lot in question to the burden of the second mortgage, they would have worked no other legal effect than to encumber the land in the hands of Chew, as the purchaser of Hassinger’s interest. Such a stipulation would not have substituted him as a party to the bond and mortgage, or cast upon him the personal responsibility which attached to Has-singer as obligor and mortgagor. It would but have subjected Chew’s interest to answer for its proportion of the sum secured by the second mortgage, in any future settlement among the co-tenants, just as it was bound to answer for the first mortgage. Were it agreed, too, that, as the associate of Miles, Chew was fully aware <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>of Hassinger’s personal liability, and even cognizant that this entered into the consideration of the parties then arranging for future partition, it would not put him into Hassinger’s -shoes for every purpose of obligation. Such a result would be produced only on proof that, by an arrangement with the other parties, he had been suffered to purchase at the sheriff’s sale, on the condition of assuming Hassinger’s personal liability, or under some similar consideration. But for this there is no pretence. The other parties were in no condition to dictate terms. The speculation had failed, and those concerned in it were embarrassed for means to meet their engagements. In less than a year after the sale to Chew, the mortgage held by Paul was sued out, and the encumbered lot sold to satisfy it. Immediately after, if not before, we find Wager, perhaps one of the wealthiest of the associates, pressed for the payment of his bond, and, after many delays, raising the money with difficulty. In short, every thing shows that, at the moment of Chew’s purchase, coming ruin had frowned upon the enterprise, and threatened a disastrous termination. Under every concession, then, the most that can be said is, that when Chew became the purchaser, he took the property as between him and the other tenants, encumbered by the two mortgages, deriving no beneficial interest beyond the surplus value. This was the position in which the law placed him, and there is no fact established sufficient to change it. So far as he was concerned, as holder of Hassinger’s interest, the land was, alone, pledged for payment. That failing, neither creditor nor co-tenant could call upon him for a farthing, and when lot No. 1 was afterwards actually sold for less than the amount of the first mortgage, Chew had no further interest in the subject. There was, consequently, nothing in his relation to the lot from which the law could deduce an implied undertaking to pay any portion of the judgment accompanying the Weaver mortgage.</p>

'They were not held with the plaintiff, or any one representing him. They were addressed to'third persons who, as agents of the creditor, were pressing for payment of Wager’s bond. Before the sale, under the Paul mortgage, Chew said to Mr. Badger he would pay his proportion; that in honor and conscience he considered himself bound to pay one-third of the Weaver mortgage, and was willing to do so, but had not the means. As indicating a contract, these expressions are altogether deficient in time, place, circumstance, and the ground of the undertaking. If he thought himself bound to pay, it is clear he was mistaken, and no action arises from such mistaken concession. But from the form of phrase used, he probably distinguished between a merely honorable and a <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>legal obligation; and it is almost needless to say that the law possesses no means to enforce tbe former. The plaintiff was well aware that to withdraw it from this category, it was incumbent upon him to show some consideration moving to the undertaking. He has failed to do so, for, I repeat, knowledge of the prior arrangements by Chew, and even his assent to them as the associate of Miles, bound him not to personal responsibility as the sheriff’s vendee. The conversations detailed by Mr. Dougherty were had after the sale made under the Paul mortgage, and, therefore, after Chew’s interest had entirely ceased. They are, consequently, if possible, still more destitute of consideration than the prior declarations. There is, absolutely, nothing upon which to ground them.</p>
    <p id="b337-5" data-blocks='[["BL_337.5",337,[172,929,1167,1101]]]'>It has not been urged upon us that the paper of August 1839, signed by Miles and Chew, creates a responsibility that can be enforced in this action. Had it been, several unanswerable objections present themselves. First, it has, of course, no reference to Chew’s supposed liability, originating in his after purchase at sheriff’s sale; and the object of this action is,to enforce that supposed liability. Second, if it proposed a contract at all, it would seem to have been with the Tradesmen and Mechanics’ Loan Company, the then holders of the Weaver mortgage, and from whence the consideration of forbearance had or was to proceed. Though, in* strict terms, it stipulates with Wager, it is pretty manifest it was a proposal made to the Loan Company, to induce a wished for delay, which Miles and Chew had then an interest in procuring. No consideration is stated as proceeding from Wager, and no reason given why such an arrangement should be made for his sole benefit. On the other hand, we can easily understand why the two associates should be willing to purchase time, by offering to add their responsibility to the liability of Mr. Wager, upon which the company alone depended. But if it is to be regarded as a contract with Wager to assist him, at any future time, to pay the debt, it is, as the case stands, wholly without consideration. It is not shown that any, the least, moved from Wager to Miles and Chew, as the inducement of this undertaking. The existence of a consideration should not be left to mere conjecture, and the only consideration stated in the paper itself, proceeded from the corporation, the then holder of the debt.</p>
    <p id="b337-6" data-blocks='[["BL_337.6",337,[174,2040,1162,174]]]'>Another objection is, that this paper, if it be operative at all, establishes a joint liability, and cannot be made the basis of a separate suit against Chew’s personal representatives, the joint contractor, Miles, surviving.</p>
    <p id="b337-7" data-blocks='[["BL_337.7",337,[174,2213,1161,168]],["BL_338.1",338,[325,410,1162,88]]]'>As these and other answers to the paper, probably presented themselves to the notice of the plaintiff’s counsel, it seems to have been introduced rather as one of the incidents attending the multiplied transactions of these parties, during a course of years, and <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>as explanatory of their relations, than as affording a distinct ground of suit; and it was, accordingly, so treated here.</p>
    <p id="b338-6" data-blocks='[["BL_338.6",338,[320,497,1164,297]]]'>I cannot leave this part of the case without the observation that, after all, it is possible there was an undertaking, upon a sufficient consideration, by Chew, as purchaser of Hassinger’s interest, to pay one-third the amount of the mortgage money. From his repeated professions of a willingness to do so, one is inclined to suspect such was the fact. But suspicion is not enough, and it is the misfortune of the plaintiff that he is unable to show the fact.</p>
    <p id="b338-7" data-blocks='[["BL_338.7",338,[316,795,1167,686]]]'>The second branch of the case, as presented here, originates in the rejection of the plaintiff’s book account in the court below. Had the original narr. covered this cause of action, a bill of particulars need not have been voluntarily furnished. The account would have been admissible under the declaration alone. But, unfortunately, the plaintiff did not count for goods sold, and the offer to introduce it at the trial was an offer of a new cause of action, which came too late. The amended bill of particulars did not help the omission. Even conceding that, under á bill of particulars properly furnished, this item of claim might have been received, a bill cannot be amended, as it seems, without leave of the court, 1 <em>Tidd’s Pr. </em>644-645; 1 <em>Taunt. </em>353, because it is regarded as part of the- narr. For myself, my inclination would be, liberally, to permit amendment, where no danger of injustice was incurred by it. In this instance, the court refused, no doubt, for sufficient reasons. We cannot say there was error in this.</p>
    <p id="b338-8" data-blocks='[["BL_338.8",338,[1102,1480,332,44]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
