Knox, defendant, to try the right to money in court raised on a mortgage given by Nathan Mitchell to Platt Knox, on certain real estate situate in Lewisburg, Union county. It was stated, that in the year 1846, Nathan Mitchell, of Union county, (who was engaged in the manufacture of iron at the Berlin iron-works,) made application to Platt Knox, of Red Hook, Dutchess county, and State of New York, a relative of his, for a loan of money. Platt Knox, not having money of his own at that time to lend, called on Garret Yankeuren, of same place, agent of Mrs. Louise Livingston, and on the 1st day of February, negotiated a loan of $2600, by giving his note, <em>with his brother, Andrew JP. Knox, as surety ; </em>that on the next day he loaned the same $2600, together with $26 in addition, making $2626, to said Nathan Mitchell, and took his bond for it, payable on demand, with interest, which he secured by a mortgage on certain property, situate in the borough of Lewis-burg, Union county, Pennsylvania, which mortgage was duly recorded on the 9th day of February, 1846. Platt Knox afterwards failed, and the said Andrew P. Knox, the surety, was compelled to pay <a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>said Mrs. Louise Livingston the $2600 aforesaid, with the interest thereon, which, under the laws of the State of New York, was seven per cent. Platt Knox, in order to secure his brother, Andrew P. Knox, as bail aforesaid, on the 11th of January, 1848, assigned his said mortgage against Nathan Mitchell to said Andrew P. Knox. On the 15th of February, 1848, judgment for $2946.80 was obtained on the mortgage against Nathan Mitchell. <em>Al. lev. facias </em>issued,- and $3046 was paid into court for distribution.</p>

On the 17th of February, 1849, John Moatz and Moatz &amp; Harper obtained judgments against Platt Knox for their claims—John Moatz for $671.84, Moatz &amp; Harper for $677.60. John Moatz and Moatz &amp; Harper laid claim to the money in court, by virtue of their attachments, alleging that the assignment of the mortgage by Platt Knox to Andrew P. Knox was fraudulent. The court then directed two feigned issues to try the contested facts as to the m'oney in court: in one, John Moatz was made plaintiff and Andrew P. Knox defendant, and in the other, Moatz &amp; Harper were made plaintiffs, and Andrew P. Knox defendant. Plaintiffs filed declarations for money had and received, to which the defendant plead payment, with leave to give the special matter in evidence. The issues came on to be tried at May term 1849, when verdicts were rendered in favor of Andrew P. Knox in each case. Plaintiffs moved the cases to the Supreme Court, and judgments were reversed, on the ground that the. notice of special matter was not sufficiently explicit. The cause came on again to be tried at an adjourned court held in October 1849, when the plaintiff, failing to give any evidence of fraud or mistake in the assignment, contended that the money in court was more than sufficient to pay Platt Knox for the money he paid Mrs. Louise Livingston: the court submitted that fact to the jury, with instructions that if they found there was more money in court than would pay Platt Knox, that they should find in favor of the plaintiff for such over-plus. Defendant (Andrew P. Knox) contended, in the first place, that he had purchased the whole mortgage; that there was no over-plus ; but, even if there was, it belonged to him: and, in the second place, that the foreign attachments were illegal, and all proceedings thereon void.</p>
