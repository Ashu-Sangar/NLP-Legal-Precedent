But where the seller, though not the owner of the fee, has an equitable estate in the premises under articles of agreement for its purchase, and the right to acquire the legal title, and actually acquired it, after the contract of sale, but before any laches could properly be imputed to him, he may compel a specific performance.</p>

It is no valid objection to the execution of a contract for the purchase of real estate that the vendee has died, and that, therefore, the execution by the vendee of the bonds and mortgage, required by the contract, is impossible. The heirs at law or the residuary devisees of the vendee’s estate may carry out the contract. But, where such a difficulty arises from the death or bankruptcy of the purchaser, it perhaps may be in the option of the seller to rescind the <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>contract or to demand specific performance; and if defendants are unable or unwilling to perform the contract, perhaps the estate may be sold, and defendants ordered to pay any difference in the amount of the purchase-money.

This is true, but it presents no obstacle against the equitable interposition of the court, as here invoked. A general agreement to sell a property means a sale in <a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>fee simple, and chancery will not compel a purchaser to take a life estate; nor will he he obliged to take an estate in which the vendor had no interest as owner at the time of the pretended sale, because one who speculates on that which is not within his control, is not a <em>bona fide </em>contractor, and because, also, there is no mutuality between the parties. But the seller, though not the legal owner, has an equitable means to make himself so, and if he employs that means successfully, though subsequently to his contract of sale, he may compel a specific performance; for in this there is nothing inequitable : Leigh <em>v. </em>Huber, <a href="/watts/3/0367-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts 367" data-case-ids="1841309" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0367-01">3 <em>Watts </em>367</a>.

Setting aside for the present the question raised as to the effect of the act of Assembly of the 28th of March, 1836, to enlarge the powers of the trustees under the will of Mr. Blackwell, the plaintiffs, by virtue of the agreement with them, were vested with an equitable estate in the premises, which they converted into a legal estate in fee simple, on the 4th February, 1840, long before any supposed <em>laches </em>on their part had occurred. They were, therefore, in a condition to convey to Mrs. Yohe, in her lifetime, the estate they had covenanted to grant, and, in fact, made an effort to perfect its conveyance by deed, on the 6th February, 1840, which appears to have been defeated by the illness and subsequent death of Mrs. Yohe, on the 16 th of the same month. In reality, there is nothing in this objection, which, indeed, in this aspect of it, was but little pressed on the argument. But it is, secondly, objected, that one of the parties to the last-mentioned deed was Henry M. Watts, to whom Peter Shoenberger had, on the preceding day, conveyed one moiety of his interest in the premises, with, as it is averred and proved, notice of the sale by Shoenberger and Tiernan to Yohe, and looked with a full understanding that he was to join in any necessary conveyance to her. Notwithstanding this understanding and agreement, the defendants urge that Mrs. Yohe, her heirs or assigns, are not bound to recognise a party in the transaction with whom she never contracted, and that the conveyance to Watts was an election by the plaintiffs to abandon the contract. How an abandonment or relinquishment of the contract can be averred, in the face of the efforts made on the day succeeding the deed to Watts, and, subsequently, up to the present moment, to consummate the agreement, it is difficult to conceive. Such, certainly, was not the intention of the parties, nor did the conveyance to Watts work such an effect apart from intention. It is very true, that one man cannot substitute himself as vendor for another, with whom he has no privity or connection. A purchaser is not bound to accept title from any one but him from whom he bought, or his representatives, as was decided in Taylor <em>v. </em>Porter, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Dana%20422" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Dana 422">1 <em>Dana </em>422</a>, where the pretended vendor had no title whatever, and Taylor, claiming title altogether independent of him, attempted to substitute himself in <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>the contract as a party having a right to execute it specifically. But our own case of Le Boy de Chamont <em>v. </em>Forsyth, 2 <em>Pa. Pep. </em>507, shows that the mere transmission of the legal title to another, subject to the equity of the purchaser, creates no impediment to a decree 'for a specific execution, especially when the parties had the sale in view at the time of the transmission. Here but a portion of the land was conveyed to Watts, who, the next day, joined in the deed to Mrs. Yohe, and, as he says, without contradiction, has ever since been willing to perfect her title. There is, then, nothing in this part of the transaction which stands in the way of the plaintiff—for if the purchaser gets the estate he bargained for from the parties with whom he contracted, or their privies, it is all that in equity he can ask.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b437-5" data-blocks='[["BL_437.5",437,[147,955,1180,1464]],["BL_438.1",438,[290,391,1174,1794]]]'>But it is said, that the deed of the 6th February, which it was sought to tender to Mrs. Yohe, was insufficiently acknowledged by the grantors’ wives, or some of them, and that the mortgage and bonds accompanying it were, in'' their conditions, a departure from the terms of the contract, by which the time of payment of the balance of the purchase-money was, within certain limits, left at the option of the purchaser. Admitting that these objections would be valid in answer to an actual tender pleaded, it is not perceived that they detract from the value of the. effort made to offer the conveyance to Mrs. Yohe, in her lifetime, as evidence of the vendors’ willingness and desire to comply with their agreement. Had the tender been actually made, and the purchaser objected to receiving the conveyance and executing the bonds and mortgage, because the former was not well acknowledged, and the latter did not conform to the covenant's between the parties, and the vendors had declined to amend the acknowledgment or to accept of other securities, until the filing of their bill in this cause, there would, probably, have been solidity in this part of the defence. But this is far from being the case. Mrs. Yohe died before access could be had to her by the vendors’ agent, and those who succeeded her have always refused to perform her contract, but not on the ground that the vendors were not willing to accept bonds and mortgage in compliance with the agreement as to the time of payment, which is the only substantial matter connected "with it. The subsequent tender in court, upon the trial of the issues at law between the parties, can also, perhaps may be accepted as a proof of a continued willingness of the vendors to convey, and disinclination on the part of the defendants to receive the title. Admitting this deed was, since the death of Mrs. Yohe, insufficient in law as an assurance, it is enough in equity, if the vendor be in a position- to convey the estate sold by him, at any time before decree made, unless there has been such lapse of time, change of circumstances, or the vendor has been guilty of such gross laches, as entitles the purchaser to treat the contract as <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>rescinded. If, therefore, in this case, it be found that no such objectionable features exist, it is not yet too late to make a conveyance to the persons who, under the original agreement, may be entitled to it. But the defendants aver that all these elements, destructive of the plaintiffs’ rights to have a specific performance, are present in the cause. The rules that are applicable to this part of the case, as extracted from the numerous authorities, with which I do not mean to swell this opinion, are thus lucidly stated by Mr. Justice Story, in Taylor <em>v. </em>Longstreth, 14 <em>Peters’ Pep. </em>174:—Time may b§ held of the essence of the contract, either by the express stipulation of the parties, or, it may be, arise by implication, from the very mature of the property or the avowed objects of the purchaser or seller; and even where time is not thus, either expressly or impliedly, of the essence of the contract, if a party, seeking a specific execution has been guilty of gross laches, or has been inexcusably negligent in performing the contract on his part, or if, in the intermediate period, there has been a material change of circumstances, affecting the rights, interests, and obligations of the parties, equity will refuse to decree a specific performance, on the ground that it would be inequitable and unjust. But, except under these or analogous circumstances, time is not treated as of the essence of the contract, and relief will be decreed to the party who seeks it, if he has not been grossly negligent and comes within reasonable time, although he has not complied with the strict terms of the contract. Such are the rules which obtain even where a particular time is fixed by the agreement of sale, for consummating it, and, of course, the application is the more stringent where, as here, no distinct period is pointed to: <em>Sugden on Vend,. </em>807, 11 ed. 1846. But even then, I agree that a man cannot call upon a court of equity for a specific performance, unless he has shown himself ready, desirous, prompt, and eager; and, therefore, time alone is, in some instances, au sufficient bar to the aid of the court. As, for instance, where the parties differed as to the construction of an agreement, and, after a delay of seven years, one of them filed a bill for specific performance, it was dismissed merely on account of the staleness of the demand: Milherd <em>v. </em>Earl of Thayne, 5 <em>Ves. </em>720. A plaintiff calling for performance, after a great lapse of time, must satisfy the court, that he did not lie by to take advantage of fortuitous circumstances; that during the whole period, he had it in contemplation to perform the contract, and that the other party expected to be called on: Aluy <em>v. </em>Deschamps, 12 <em>Ves. </em>225.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b438-6" data-blocks='[["BL_438.6",438,[278,2187,1179,214]],["BL_439.1",439,[148,384,1172,426]]]'>It may be perceived, from what has been said, that there is a difference between mere lapse of time, and where it is attended with some gross and injurious negligence of a duty incumbent on the party to perform. Where time is material, its mere flight beyond ■ a precise point may bar the equitable remedy. Where it is not of <a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>the essence of the contract, expressly or impliedly, some inexcusable laches must attach upon the party to estop him from claiming the execution of the agreement. Where, says C. J. Marshall, id Garrett <em>v. </em>Muskon, 6 <em>Oall </em>336, time is really material to the parties, the right to a specific performaneé may depend on it. But if the principle of discharge by delay applies to the case of a willing purchaser, it is open on the other side to rebut that, by showing the purchaser was not a willing purchaser, and that he ought not to be discharged on the ground of hardship or delay: Sir Anthony Hart, in McGinnis <em>v. </em>Folien, 2 <em>Moll. </em>561.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b439-5" data-blocks='[["BL_439.5",439,[148,812,1174,1584]],["BL_440.1",440,[290,383,1171,1838]]]'>In the present instance, there is no express stipulation by the parties that time should be material; nor do J derive any such implication of it from the nature of the property sold, or the object of the purchaser, as would justify in itself a refusal of the prayer of this bill. It has, indeed, been suggested that Mrs. Yohe’s object in making the purchase was speculation upon the state of the market, which was defeated by the rapid decline in the price of real estate at about that period; but this suggestion is unsupported by proof, and were it otherwise, perhaps it would be found to be the duty of the purchaser to tender her securities, and demand a conveyance before she was at liberty to declare the contract at an end. Nor do I see any such material change of circumstances, affecting the interests of the parties, as ought to induce the court to refuse its aid. As will presently be shown, the death of Mrs. Yohe, not long after the agreement of sale, cannot be allowed to work this effect, and there is surely nothing in the circumstances urged upon us by the defendant’s counsel, that her will disposes of all her estate, leaving no room, as it is said, for the operation of the agreement. Had this will been executed after the purchase, it would have presented no obstacle, being simply the work of the purchaser; and it is much less so, since it was actually made before the contract of sale. Time in itself being immaterial here, has there been such supine negligence on the. part of the vendors as shall deprive them of this equitable remedy ? It seems impossible to affirm this with truth, in the face of the earnest endeavours which the bill, answers, and proofs show have, almost from the inception of the sale, been made by the vendors to carry it into effect against the struggles of the defendants in resistance of it. Upon this head, without descending into minutiae, it is sufficient to observe that, commencing before the death of Mrs. Yohe, they have pursued this object with almost unabated effort through successive litigations, with more or less success, down to the present time. Whether, therefore, they have urged the proper course or not, it cannot, at least, be said they have been inactive, or by any supineness led their antagonist into the belief they did not intend insisting upon the fulfilment of the contract. But it is contended it was their duty, within a reasonable time, to tender to the acceptance of the <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>defendants a deed for the premises clear of all encumbrances, and that having failed to do so, they cannot now claim a compliance with the agreement of sale. I do not think so. By the custom of the State, it was incumbent on the vendees to propose and tender for execution the necessary instruments to perfect the transaction: this seems to me to be especially so where the time of payment of the purchase-money was, by the terms of the sale, left optional with the vendee. Until this election was made, nothing more, it appears to me, was incumbent on the vendors, than to manifest their continued disposition to fulfil their contract when called on to do so, by the declaration of an election made and a proffer of the necessary papers for .execution. Eor this position, Lowry <em>v. </em>Mehaffy, <a href="/watts/10/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="10 Watts 387" data-case-ids="1851016" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0387-01">10 <em>Watts </em>387</a>, would seem to be in point. At all events, they cannot be said to be guilty of gross laches, when the other parties not only 'omitted to call for conveyance, but from the beginning manifested an utter unwillingness to take the estate: Campbell <em>v. </em>Shrum, <a href="/watts/3/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="3 Watts 60" data-case-ids="1841271" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0060-01">3 <em>Watts </em>60</a>; and see Hampton <em>v. </em>Speckenagle, <em>9Ser.$R. </em>212. In excuse of this unwillingness, several reasons are offered by the answer to the original bill. Some of these have already been shown to be .insufficient. The two principal ones remain to be noticed. The first of these is, that the death of Mrs. Yohe rendered a specific execution of the contract impossible, as that would require the execution of a bond and mortgage to secure the payment of the deferred instalments to fall due on the 9th of December, 1846, which no one was competent to execute but Mrs. Yohe herself. This objection is more specious than solid. Though the defendants, trustees under the will of Mrs. Yohe, could not be called on to execute these securities, what was there to prevent her heirs at law, or the residuary devisees of her estate, who were made parties by the supplemental bill, from performing the stipulations of the contract in this particular ? But apart from this, I think it clear, where such a difficulty arises from the death or bankruptcy of the purchaser, it is in the option of the seller to rescind the contract, or to demand specific performance; and if the defendants are unable or unwilling to perform the contract, that the estates may be sold, and the defendants ordered to pay any difference in the amount of the purchase-money: Bolles <em>v. </em>Rogers, 6 <em>Ves. Jr. </em>95 n., and see Wright <em>v. </em>Wellesley, cited in 1 <em>Sugden on Vend. </em>302, 11th ed. It is to be observed, however, that though the inconvenience suggested might have been felt in carrying the contract into execution prior to December 1846, they do not now stand in the way of the action, of the court, inasmuch as the whole purchase-money is now due, and payment of it may be promptly decreed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b440-6" data-blocks='[["BL_440.6",440,[291,2221,1168,171]],["BL_441.1",441,[178,399,1190,601]]]'>The next ground taken by the answer is, that simultaneously with the conveyance of the legal estate by the trustees, under the will of Mr. Blackwell, to plaintiffs, the latter put it out of their power to perform their contract, by encumbering the premises by <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>mortgage! But this will not afford a ground on which the purchaser may avoid the contract. If the seller remove such encumbrances before he is called on to make title, it is sufficient: <em>Sugden on Vend. </em>679, ed. of 1846. The distinction is between a defective title, and a good title encumbered with a pecuniary charge. Equity will not compel the vendee to take the former, hut the latter presents no objection, provided the purchaser can he protected from it: Fourcan <em>v. </em>Campanion, 1 Yer.; 2 <em>Moll. </em>583; Thompson <em>v. </em>Carpenter, 4 <em>Barr </em>132. In our ease, the plaintiffs aver that the charge of the mortgage upon the land was sufficiently, removed before their bill was filed; and if so, (and this may be the subject of future inquiry,) I am of the opinion, under the circumstances of this case, its continued existence down to that time raises no obstacle in the plaintiff’s path.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b441-5" data-blocks='[["BL_441.5",441,[179,1000,1176,1026]]]'>It is objected, and this for the first time, by the answer of Tams and wife to the supplemental bill, that-on the 29th of May, 1846, the defendants, Boland and Blackstone, by their affidavits filed on record in the suit brought upon the promissory note, entirely repudiated the contract, on account of the encumbrance of the mortgage, and refused to consider the same as binding. But if this was intended as a notice of the rescission of the contract, the defendants did not go far enough; something more is required at the hands of a purchaser than simple notice of his intent to repudiate the agreement. Where a day is fixed for the completion of the contract, he must, in England, demand' an abstract of the title, and, in this country, the execution of the' conveyance on the day, with notice that if not completed he will not be bound by his bargain. Where no day is fixed, this may be within a reasonable time. But no such demand was made here. : Without any previous offer to accept- a deed, the plaintiffs, in a suit at law, are informed, as a matter of defence, the bargain is Repudiated because of the encumbrance of the mortgage. Now,,when it is recollected that this encumbrance, if removed at any time before the purchaser pays the money, offered no impediment, and that at-least a demand by the defendant was necessary in a case situated as this is, showing a willingness to.accept the title, before-'the plaintiffs were bound to rid the land of the lien of the mortgage, it is obvious the affidavit of defence is inoperative, as notice of an intent to rescind.</p>

The ingenious reasoning of the master’s report goes far to show that as the law then stood in Pennsylvania, the conveyance was efficacious for that purpose, at least in respect of the purpart released to Joseph Shippen. But it is not necessary to decide this point. Admitting the conclusion favoured by the master to be incorrect, it is very certain the statute of limitation has, long since, closed upon the rights of Mrs. Jekyl’s issue, as tenants in tail, if, indeed, she left any. The lapse of one hundred and twenty-two years affords much more than sufficient scope for the presumption that the first tenant in tail is dead, and that her issue have long ago attained full age. Indeed, this is conceded by the defendants, who make no attempt to set up an outstanding title in Mrs. Jekyl’s issue, upon which any impeachment of the plaintiff’s title can be based. But though the estate-tail be thus barred in favour of those who claim under the deed of 1736, it is contended it still exists, in law, for the protection of the remainders dependent upon it, and that the presumption, in the absence of express proof is in favor of its continuance as against the remaindermen’s right of entry, to a period within the time limited by the statute. This being admitted, it is, on the other hand, conceded that Joseph Shippen’s sons, who are two of the three that are entitled to the estate in remainder, and those claiming under them, as heirs, are estopped from setting up the estate in remainder as against their alienees.

Having thus elected, they were brought within the rule, whióh obtains, both at law and in equity, that the person claiming a benefit under a will must acquiesce in the whole of it, though the effect be- to deprive him of an estate he -would otherwise be entitled to. This rule embraces not only present but future remote inteests, and has been expressly applied to a remainder expectant upon .an estate-tail: Groves <em>v. </em>Forman, 3 <em>Ves. </em>67. Recognising this, the defendants do not attempt to take advantage of an outstanding estate in these sons. But they assert such to exist in the heirs of Joseph Shippen’s daughter, the only remaining party having an interest in the remainder. By his will, her father bequeathed to her certain pecuniary legacies, and devised all his real estate to his sons in fee. The presumption, at this distance of time, is, that the legacies were paid to her, and that she executed the general release and discharge stipulated by the will. Now, what is the rule as applicable to this state of facts? Distinctly, that if a legacy is bequeathed, and an estate or a specific thing, belonging to the legatee, is devised to another, the legatee cannot claim his own and the legacy also, but must elect: 2 <em>Sugden on Dow. </em>159. Some diversity of opinion, and, perhaps, of decision, has obtained whether acceptance of the legacy operates as a forfeiture of the estate, or whether effect shall be given to.it by the sequestration and application of so much of the thing taken under the will as will recompense the disappointed devisee for the estate which the legatee refuses to relinquish, to him. The former position is favored by Mr. <em>Sugden, </em>in a strain of very strong reasoning, while the latter was preferred by the late Mr. Justice Kennedy in his elaborate <em>dictum </em>in Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Davis, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Whart.%20511" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Whart. 511">1 <em>Whar. </em>511</a>. But there is no room for the consideration of this diversity in a case where, like the present, there was, more than a century ago, an acceptance of the legacy, and during the whole of that long period—long particularly in this country—no claim set up by anybody to the estate, derived under other title than that created by the devise. There is, therefore, not only election, but relinquishment also—acceptance of the legacy and relinquishment of the contingent estate. But this is not the objection. It is, that the daughter, being a <em>feme covert, </em>could *do nothing to affect her estate in the land. But it is long settled that the doctrine of election applies to the interest of persons under disabilities, as infants and married women; nor is it material whether these interests are immediate or remote, contingent, of value or not of value: 2 <em>Ves. </em>560, 696, 697; 3 <em>Ves. </em>383; <em>Ward on Leg. </em>187. The case of McClure <em>v. </em>Douthett, 6 <em>Barr </em>416, cited for the defendant, has no application. The general remark made by the chief justice as to. the power of a married woman to affect her estate, in its applica<a id="p452" href="#p452" data-label="452" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*452</a>tion there, means nothing more than that one under coverture, without special power, can only convey in the mode prescribed by positive law.</p>
