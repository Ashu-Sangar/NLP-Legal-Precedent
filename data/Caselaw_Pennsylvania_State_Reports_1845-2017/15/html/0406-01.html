Beek <em>vs. </em>John Licey, <em>ven. ex. </em>No. 4, September term 1849, on the 13th day of October, A. D. 1848, executed to your petitioner a mortgage to secure the payment of $900 upon the real estate sold by virtue of the said writ of <em>ven.-ex., </em>which said mortgage was duly recorded in the recorder’s office of the said county, on the said 13th day of October, A. D. 1848. That the sum of $2309, the proceeds of the sale of the said real estate of the said John Licey, sold under the said writ of <em>ven. ex., </em>was paid into court, by the sheriff, for distribution among the lien creditors of the said John Licey entitled thereto. Tour petitioner further saith that he was entitled to the said sum of $900, with interest, the amount of his said mortgage, out of the said sum of $2309 paid into court as aforesaid; but that your petitioner’s said mortgage was, by some accident or mistake of the court, overlooked and neglected to be paid, although the recorder’s certificate of the same was before the court at the time of making the distribution, and that the balance of the said sum of money paid into court, as aforesaid, amounting to about the sum of $500, was, on the 9th day of November, 1849, ordered by the court to be paid to William Beek, on an award of arbitrators obtained by him against the said John Licey, for $829.69, and entered of record May 10th, A. d. 1849, in the case of William Beek <em>vs. </em>Licey, No. 35, April term, a. d. 1849, which said case is still pending and undetermined on appeal in said court.</p>

He came to see me; I told him he had better employ an attorney, or else he might lose four or five hundred dollars of his money, if not all. He said he had a mortgage on Licey’s property, and he thought it was the first one. He then asked me, if it was mine, what I would do ? I told him I would rather pay a lawyer five or ten dollars than lose five hundred or a thousand dollars. Then he said I should give five or ten dollars to the lawyer for him. I told him if he said so, I would—so he said I should ; then he went off and came back in the evening, and said he guessed there was no use in it, as his money would have to come. Then he went off, and on Monday morning, when court was, he came again and said I should not employ an attorney, as his money would have to come without. I then told him, “May be it may, but don’t blame me if it does not.” I told him the money was distributed at that court. This conversation was just before November court. He did not say he knew any thing of it. I never saw an advertisement of the distribution. I don’t know that Licey has any property. The last I heard of Licey was in Indiana county, Ohio. The mortgage from John Licey to Abraham Althouse, dated October 13th, 1848, for $900 was given upon the real estate sold under a <em>ven. ex. </em>in the case of Abraham G-. Beek against John Licey, No. 4, September term, A. d. 1849.</p>

It would lead to manifest injustice,- (of which this case is a pregnant example,) if the court should in no case, on application made in a reasonable time, "be permitted to correct its own mistake, when plain and palpable. Here the fund is still in court, and the error (admitted to be such) may be amended without injury to any human being. The petition by the party aggrieved was filed at the next term, and after the time for taking an appeal, viz. twenty days, had expired. If, then, the court may not review its decision, the creditor is without remedy. The money, to which he is clearly entitled, goes to a person who has no claim to it; whose debt, in fact, is not yet ascertained, as the award made in his favor is appealed from, and the appeal is now pending. The mortgagee was indeed penny wise and pound foolish, of which, by this time, he is no doubt convinced. The punishment, however, would be rather severe to mulct him with the loss of his whole debt. The stringent rule, which the appellee wishes to apply to the case, would be perilous to suitor's, and sometimes most painful to the court; as mistakes cannot always, in the absence of parties not represented by counsel, be avoided.</p>
