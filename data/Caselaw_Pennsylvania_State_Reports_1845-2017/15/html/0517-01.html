By the survey, made in 1837, it appears this tract does not include the ground on which the fence was placed, but adjoins it. Defendants produced a release from Lefevre and wife to Joseph Stong, dated 1st March, 1820, of all their right in the tract of 314 acres, of which Jacob Stong died seized and intestate. He has also given in evidence a deed from Joseph Stong and wife to him, dated 2d of April, 1838. This includes the ground in dispute. If the question depended upon the paper titles thus exhibited, the conclusion must be against the plaintiff. But, it is contended by him, that he had adverse possession of the land in dispute for more than twenty-one years before the erection of the fence. If this be true, the statute of limitation gives him a good title. To determine this question, the evidence must be referred to. He has given evidence to show that the disputed strip of land had been nearly the whole time since his purchase, in April 1809, inside of the old fence, in his possession, and cultivated by him ; that the old fence was repaired, from time to time, and its position not changed; and that the land was cultivated to the fence on either side by the respective occupants. We submit the question, as one of fact, for your determination, whether there was an adverse possession by the plaintiff for more than twenty-one years before the injury complained of. It will be remembered by you, however, that to constitute an adverse possession, it must have been hostile, visible, notorious, and continued. When one man enters upon the land of another, encloses it, cultivates and occupies it in hostility to the claims of all others for the period of twenty-one years, the statute will protect him in his possession. There are prejudices against this act, but it has been properly termed a statute of repose, and tends to promote peace and prevent litigation. We think it proper to make this remark in re<a id="p521" href="#p521" data-label="521" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*521</a>gard to the law, without intending it to bear upon the facts, which are entirely for you.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b521-4" data-blocks='[["BL_521.5",521,[147,491,1175,505]]]'>The defendant, in answer to the interposition of the statute, contends there was an entry by defendants, or those under whom they claim, in December 1837, which entry avoided the operation of the statute. It appears, after Hoopes became the purchaser at public auction of Stong’s tract, he and Stong had a survey made of it, and in making that survey, they passed within plaintiff’s enclosure. The fence complained of was placed on the line thus run. An entry which will avoid the operation of the statute must bear on its face an unequivocal intent to resume the actual possession. Its effect depends on the intent of it, expressed by words or intimated by an act equally significant: Altemus <em>v. </em>Campbell, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%2031" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Watts 31">9 <em>Watts </em>31</a>.</p>

It was necessary defendant should have made an assertion or claim of ownership to the property in dispute. </em>It is asked by defendant’s counsel by what other mode an entry could be made. We might suggest many others. It might have been done by staking it out or building a fence. If you are satisfied that plaintiff held adverse possession of the ground in dispute for more than twenty-one years before the erection of the fence, he is entitled to damages: the amount will be regulated by the injury he has sustained. We omitted to call your attention to what took place between Hoopes, Stong, and Lefevre, when they met at the time of the survey. This will be taken into consideration by you.</p>

Yet when the court remarks on the acts and conversations of the parties at the time of making the survey, which were material in relation to the entry, the assertion of right by Stong and Hoopes, and the character of the' possession then claimed by Lefevre, they are withdrawn entirely from the jury, as a question of law which the court assumes to decide, and instructs the jury, “that the ascertainment of the boundaries of the whole tract about to be conveyed by the vendor to the vendee 'was not such an entry as suspended the operation of the statute. The design in making <a id="p524" href="#p524" data-label="524" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*524</a>the entry was not to resume the possession; it was made in following the courses and distances of the deed."

    <p id="b524-6" data-blocks='[["BL_524.6",524,[293,702,1169,1588]]]'>It is in evidence that Stong, the owner of the land adjoining Lefevre, his brother-in-law, had, in the autumn of 1837, sold this land at public sale, to Abraham Hoopes. Shortly after, in the same year Stong and Hoopes go upon the land with a surveyor and assistants to ascertain its boundaries and quantity. In doing so, they enter on this piece of land in dispute, go to the corner within Lefevre’s enclosure to run from, in order to ascertain and fix the location of the boundary-line on the side of Lefevre, according to the draft, and the right of Stong the vendor, and Hoopes the vendee, as well as to ascertain the quantity to be paid for by Hoopes. Whilst so engaged, Lefevre comes to them at the cross-road adjacent to the land in controversy. We cannot suppose Lefevre ignorant of the public sale of the adjoining farm, and the purpose of Stong and Hoopes, in making the survey and entering within the field, to assert the extent of the claim and right of Stong, by running the line. From the remark of Lefevre and his acts, it would appear that he observed and did not mistake their acts in entering within his enclosed field, and surveying off the small piece of land in dispute, by a line diverging a few feet from the old fence, extending to the public road, and embracing, as is stated, about the eighth of an acre. Lefevre does not remonstrate against this entry and survey as an encroachment on his land, nor does he assert that this piece of land was his property, but appeals to Stong as the owner, with whom he was familiar, saying, “ Joe, you know very well your father promised me that I should have that piece of land:” not that it was his, or that it had been granted or given to him, but that there had been a promise that he should have it, but on what terms is not stated. This remark is addressed to Stong, the claimant, and in the presence of Hoopes, the purchaser. Stong replied that if Mr. Hoopes had a mind to give it to him, he might. Hoopes says in answer, that he has no land to give away. The allusion in this conversation, says the surveyor, was made to the land in dispute. Lefevre, it would seem, made no resistance or opposition to the entry and survey, nor, after the reply of Stong and Hoopes, manifested any dissatisfaction, but passed with the party <em>pleasantly </em>as far as his line went, his son Jacob holding the sight-pole up the road.</p>

The design of this statute was to give peace and quiet <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>to the community. It has been well called a statute of repose, and experience has proved' most satisfactorily the policy of it. But it is not to be used as a sword of offence, to do manifest wrong.</p>
    <p id="b525-5" data-blocks='[["BL_525.5",525,[174,537,1176,1248]]]'>We do not deem it necessary to go beyond the adjudications within this commonwealth to determine the character of an entry on land that is to save the operation and bar of this statute. In the case of Holtzapple <em>v. </em>Phillibaum, 4 <em>Wash. C. C. R. </em>356, it is ruled that to constitute a legal entry on land to avoid the bar of the statute, the party must enter with intent to claim the possession, and must do some act to prove that such was his intention by acts amounting to a trespass on the land, or he must declare that he enters for the purpose of claiming or taking possession. No particular form of words is prescribed by the law; the substantial part is the taking, or declaring an intention to take or claim possession. An entry on land, says Chief Justice Gibson, in delivering the opinion of this court in Altemus <em>v. </em>Campbell, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%2030" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 Watts 30">9 <em>Watts </em>30</a>, “ avoids the operation of the act of limitation, if accompanied by an explicit declaration, or an act of notorious dominion, by which the claimant challenges the right of the occupant.” So in the case of Miller <em>v. </em>Shaw 7 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>129, it is said, where a person enters <em>animo clamandi, </em>as when he enters and surveys the land, it operates as a bar to the act; and where the intent with which the entries were made, is doubtful, the question of intention was to be submitted to the jury. In the case of Ingersoll <em>v. </em>Lewis, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20212" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Jones 212">1 <em>Jones </em>212</a>, per Rogers, J., it is ruled that “where the agent of the owner enters upon land with the avowed object of claiming it, making a survey thereof with the knowledge and assent of the person in possession, these acts operate to bar the running of the statute; and if the proof of them is satisfactory to the jury, the court should give a binding direction to that effect.” Other cases in this court might be referred to in affirmance of the law of entry in relation to the bar of the statute as contained in the cases already cited.</p>
    <p id="b525-6" data-blocks='[["BL_525.6",525,[176,1784,1174,646]],["BL_526.1",526,[297,416,1172,1145]]]'>In the case under consideration, the entry was made in 1837, before the alleged bar of the statute, by Stong, the owner, and Hoopes, the purchaser of his right, with the surveyor and his assistants ; and though for the purpose of surveying the entire tract, it was to include within that survey the piece of land since in dispute. They proceed to make that survey, including the land since claimed by Lefevre. Was there not in this act of survey, by such parties, in the presence of Lefevre, the occupant, an entry with a declaration of claim ? an act of notorious dominion, by which Stong challenged the right of Lefevre ? Did not Lefevre so understand it ? He appeals to the recollection of Stong, if his father had not promised him that he should have that <em>bit </em>of land. Lefevre asserts no title in himself, or claims any possession adverse to any other. He makes no opposition or remonstrance against the assertion of claim by Stong, nor exhibits any further dissatisfaction, but passed <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>with the party pleasantly as far as his line went. Is there in the remarks or conduct of Lefevre, a single feature of hostility to the claim of Stong thus publicly made ? Does he not exhibit acquiescence and submission to the then act of ownership on the part of Stong ? Could there be any other reasonable inference from that acquiescence than that he held this <em>bit </em>of land, as he called it, subject to the will and pleasure of Stong ? If Lefevre then intended to rely on an adverse possession in himself, his conduct and silence were such as to deceive and mislead both Stong and Hoopes, and allow Hoopes to pay his money for land surveyed to him, and which he, Lefevre, did not then claim, and which he afterwards attempts to take from him by color of law. Having been silent after the reply and refusal of Stong and Hoopes to give him this land, is he afterwards to be allowed to assert a claim inconsistent with that silence and submission ? If Hoopes delayed a few years to take possession of the land within his boundary, by making a new and more permanent fence, is the occupant, who had recognised his right, to profit by the delay ? It is well said by Chief Justice GrlBSON, in Sailor <em>v. </em>Hertzhog, 2 <em>Barr </em>184, why should an occupant be protected who has himself induced the delay by insincere professions of submission, and how can his intention be made to appear by any thing else than his declaration ? It is for the jury to decide on doubtful conversations, how far they amount to a recognition of title: Mills <em>v. </em>Shaw, 7 Ser. <em>&amp; R. </em>129. If Lefevre did not intend to hold in hostility, it is settled by Criswell <em>v. </em>Altemus, <em>7 Waits </em>566, and Sailor <em>v. </em>Hertzhog, 2 <em>Barr </em>184, that the possession was not adverse.</p>

This makes the owners of the adjoining lands less exact in placing them on the boundary-line, than when they make a more permanent and expensive fence. There is, in the first class of cases, frequently a departure from the exact line, occasioned by mistake, want of skill, or want of attention in the maker; and, on an extended straight line of some distance, there will be diversions on both sides from the right line. In such cases, between neighbours, there are generally a common forbearance and acquiescence, which are evidence of permission, when the encroachment is small; and as such, these fences are on both sides amicably repaired for many years, by dividing the distance and selecting their parts, without any intention in the one to acquire a right by possession, or any suspicion in the other that by his indulgence and forbearance he was to lose his established and rightful boundary. The occupancy of land bounded by a fence so made and kept up with all its curvatures, to give title by adverse possession for twenty-one years against the adjoining owner, where the <a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>encroachment is but a small diversion from the real line, should be obvious and unequivocally adverse—the hostility so marked as not to be mistaken, and not dependent on inference from occupancy, as might be allowed in the case of an entire tract or a considerable enclosure, which would be visible and notorious. We would say, in reference to the possession of a small strip of land along a boundary fence so situated, as was said by the court in the case of Gray <em>v. </em>Creary, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Yeates%20496" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Yeates 496">4 <em>Yeates </em>496</a>, “ that the evidence of possession does not apply with the same force as when the whole of a tract of land is held adversely.” Slighter circumstances of acquiescence in the boundary fence, where the division was not obvious, might be allowed to show that the possession was not adverse, but subject to the will of the real owner.</p>
