He resided there till 1836. Kerr Russel testifies that he was the collector of the county-tax in the years 1832 and 1834. Michael Freese is charged nine cents tax, each of those years, in the county duplicate, and they are marked paid. He has no recollection who paid him, but supposes it was Freese. John McCormick assessed and collected the poor-tax of Turbut township for 1835. He says that Freese was taxed five cents in his duplicate, and that he believes that Freese paid the tax.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b146-12" data-blocks='[["BL_146.12",146,[293,1488,1171,343]]]'>The only-question of importance in this case is, whether Michael Freese, Jr., the pauper, gained a residence in that part of Old Turbut township which is now Delaware township, so as to make that township liable to support him as a pauper; or whether the residence he acquired by birth, as the son of Michael Freese, the elder, in that part of Old Turbut now within the bounds of Lewis township, throws the expense of his support as a pauper on Lewis township.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b146-13" data-blocks='[["BL_146.13",146,[296,1832,1174,600]]]'>From the evidence adduced, it is clear that the residence of Michael Freese, the father, was in that part of Turbut now set off into Lewis township ; and that his son Michael acquired a residence by birth in Turbut township. Before the father died, he hired out his son to Daniel Frymire, who worked under a contract for his victuals, clothes, and schooling, for two years and one month. Michael the son, was about twelve years old when he went to live with Frymire; and he continued to live with and work for him about one year after the death of Michael Freese’s father. All the time the work was done, no division had been made of old Turbut township; but Daniel Frymire lived in that part of said township which was, in the year 1848, set off into Delaware township—the old township being, in the year 1843, divided into three townships, viz. Delaware, Lewis, and Turbut.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b147-6" data-blocks='[["BL_147.6",147,[174,658,1172,307]]]'>The settlement of a pauper is the place of his birth: the father’s settlement is the settlement of the children, where it can be found out. See 3 <em>W. &lt;$• Ser. </em>548. Until the son acquires a new settlement, his father’s settlement is his. He must contract a relation inconsistent with the idea of being part of his father’s family, as marriage, or arriving at the age of twenty-one years, &amp;c., before he becomes emancipated, &amp;c.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b147-7" data-blocks='[["BL_147.7",147,[173,966,1175,862]]]'>In the present case, the son had a settlement by birth or parentage in that part of Old Turbut township now within the lines of Lewis township. His father placed him out to work in the same township of Turbut, afterwards within the lines of Delaware township. Did the son gain any new residence by his own or his father’s acts. He already had a legal residence in Turbut: could he gain another residence in the same township ? The act of Assembly says “ he shall be supported by that township within the territory of which he resided at the time of gaining such settlement.” At what time did he gain a settlement ? So long as Old Turbut remained undivided, he had a legal settlement, prior to working for Erymire therein. Whether he worked for one year or ten years in the old township, neither gained nor lost his settlement; and the mere fact of performing labor so as to <em>gain </em>a settlement, in case he had none before, would not, in our opinion, take away the original settlement which he acquired as the son of old Michael Ereese. We are, therefore, of opinion, that the settlement of Michael Ereese, Jr., the pauper, was in that part of Old Turbut, which is in the territory of Lewis township; and decree that Lewis township pay the expenses of supporting the said pauper, &amp;c.</p>
