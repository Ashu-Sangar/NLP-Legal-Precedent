      <em>Per curiam. </em>The parties went to trial on a short plea of <em>set-off </em>&lt; <em>and </em>notice, without replication, which is of quite common occurrence in our practice. After the evidence had been closed, and the counsel for plaintiff was addressing the jury, he asked leave to reply the statute of limitations. The judge, with a view of bringing the question before the court in banc, refused permission, with this reservation, that the verdict and certificate, if for defendant, should be set aside and judgment entered for the plaintiff, if the court in banc should be of opinion either that the plaintiff had a legal right, under the act of 1806, to file the replication, or that the defence of the statute was available to him under the circumstances, and according to our practice, without having specially replied it. It is unnecessary to decide whether the plaintiff had a right to file his replication, as we are clearly of opinion that, according to our practice, the defendant having gone to trial without demanding a replication, the plaintiff could avail himself of any lawful defence to the plea of set-off. It has indeed been held, in one of our sister <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>States, that a plaintiff may reply double to a plea of set-off, because it is in effect a cross action.

The defence of the statute was not available to the plaintiffs without their having specially replied it. The practice in Pennsylvania has always been to consider a case at issue after the filing of any plea, replication, &amp;c., which concludes either expressly or impliedly to the country. The practice has been so in England: 2 <em>iSaund. </em>319, a. note. 1. It is supposed to be an omission in the prothonotary to enter a similiter. 2. A similiter is implied in the “&amp;c.” added to the last pleading. 3. It is making that right which the party understood to be so by going to trial. It is therefore implied that the pleading which is thus allowed to be omitted would be, if filed, a general traverse: 9 <em>Barr </em>123; <em>id. </em>139. But none of these reasons apply to a replication of the statute of limitations to a plea of set-off, which replication concludes with a verification, and to which the defendants may rejoin in confession and avoidance. It is understood, when parties go to trial upon a plea of set-off not replied to, that the replication, if filed, would be a general traverse. If so, then nothing can be given in evidence by the plaintiff that is not admissible under such general traverse ; and the rule has been invariable, both in England and in this country, that the statute of limitations must be pleaded or replied <a id="p211" href="#p211" data-label="211" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*211</a>specially, and cannot be given in evidence under the general issue.</p>

This plea has come into use in imitation of the practice under the English statute, which directs it to be used. Our statute, however, enacts that the plaintiff may plead payment, and give any bond, note, bill, or book-account, in evidence; and <a id="p212" href="#p212" data-label="212" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*212</a>payment was actually pleaded here, tliough set-off was added to <em>it. </em>The latter is not warranted by the common law or our own statute, or by any thing else than long practice. Still, I believe it is not the practice generally, to reply to it. It has been added to the plea of payment, rather as an amplification of it than as a plea itself. It is admitted that, if payment alone had been pleaded, although the replication to it could have <em>been </em>nothing but <em>non solvit, </em>it would have let in the statute. But what would be the proper replication to set-off as a special plea ? <em>Non </em>assumpsit, or <em>actio non accrevit, infra sex annos, </em>would sound oddly. However that may be, special replication was waived by withdrawing the plea of non assumpsit, and consenting to go to trial without it, which left the defence to the set-off at large, and entitled the plaintiff to avail himself of the statute or any thing else.</p>
