Baker, his agent, June 3d, 1847, purchased certain goods of the plaintiffs, for the price of $1194 91. The goods-were placed in cases, addressed Jesse Rhoades, Uhricksville, Ohio, from John H. Brown &amp; Co., and put in the street before plaintiff’s door, and a bill of them was prepared by the book-keeper, to be handed to Baker when he called. A few days after the sale, but not more than a week, a drayman, alleged not to be known to plaintiffs or Baker, and without instructions from either, called, and plaintiffs’ porter delivered the goods to him, and entered them on the delivery-book as delivered. On June 7th, they were taken by the drayman to the transportation house of Leech &amp; Co., common carriers, to be by them carried to Pittsburgh; while there they were seized under a writ of foreign attachment, issued by Dibler, Pray &amp; Co. against Rhoades. The plaintiffs sued the sheriff in this action. The plaintiffs denied <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>that there was any delivery of the goods to the drayman, alleging that they were handed over by their porter by mistake; that by the terms of the sale, Baker, the agent of Rhoades, was to give a note; that such note was not given, but the delivery was made by their porter without orders, and by mistake. It was alleged on part of plaintiffs, that Rhoades had previously dealt with the plaintiffs, and always gave his note for his purchases, and took the bill, receipted at the foot thereof, as paid by note at six months.</p>

Till actual delivery, the vendors had at least a qualified property in them, and property is possession enough to support trespass against a wrongdoer, or any one who claims by his right. Both are trespassers ; and the owner is entitled to the possession against them, separately or conjointly. The goods were packed and put on the pavement for delivery, but picked up by a porter who seems to have dropped from the clouds, and taken to the transportation warehouse, where they were immediately attached by the defendants. The evidence that this took place by management or mistake, was enough to be left to the jury. Baker, who had bought the goods for the vendees, did not return to pay for them with cash or a note <em>; </em>nor did he include them in his list of purchases handed to Atwood &amp; Co. to collect his goods and have them taken to the transportation warehouse. The facts were not contradicted, and they made a <em>prima facie </em>case.</p>

Of these terms, we have no other evidence than what is afforded by a course of previous dealing ; and the question is whether it is competent. Evidence of a general course of dealing in the same line, and at the same market, is undoubtedly so ; and it would be strange if a uniform course between particular traders were not. As it comes more immediately home to the business of the parties, it is <a id="p218" href="#p218" data-label="218" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*218</a>decisively more satisfactory, and it is, in the usual current of. affairs, the best that can he had. A sale is seldom made by a clerk or attested by one; for when the vendee is unwilling to comply with the bargain as the vendor understands it, the goods are retained, and there is an end of the matter. If the vendor happen to let the possession slip from him, what other evidence of terms can he produce but a consistent course of dealing with the vendee in a particular way ? Were it excluded, all would be excluded. Why does payment of the price of goods taken up by a servant authorize him to pledge the master’s credit again ? Because such had -been the previous course. Evidence like the present, therefore, is not only the best, but powerfully persuasive. The facts proved by it, were that Baker had closed all former bills by a note at six months; that he did not come back to close the bill in question ; and that he did not direct Atwood &amp; Co. to send their porter for the goods. As the sale was made by one of the plaintiffs, the evidence was properly received.</p>
