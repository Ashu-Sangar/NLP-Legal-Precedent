The vesting of that right had no relation to any political or municipal corporation. An erection of new townships would not alter the lines of certified Plymouth, and could not affect the rights of those who, living within the newly erected townships, were corporators in the corporation, as land-owners in certified Plymouth. In case of a division, it would be immaterial which party retained the old name. The assumption of the new name would not divest old rights. That the working of the corporation did not depend upon the boundaries of the township of Plymouth, as erected by the Court of Quarter Sessions. He therefore held that the erection of the township of Jackson, by the Court 'of Quarter Sessions, in no way affected the rights of the inhabitants of certified Plymouth, holding lands within Jackson, to vote at the corporation election for trustees, and to participate as fully in the benefits of the fund as if that township had notsbeen erected. The act of incorporation prescribed who are to be corporators, and no by-law of the corporation could enlarge or restrict the number, or change the qualifications. The landholders residing in the certified township, whether of larger or smaller lots, are each entitled to the privileges and immunities of corporators, and none others can be admitted <em>without legislative provision.</em>

The cases in which such regulations are prescribed are of constant occurrence, and the very act, incorporating the defendants, and vesting in them the rights certified to the committees and held in trust for the proprietors, is an instance of the exercise of that power.</p>

They have erected the land-owners of Jackson township into a corporation, similar in every essential particular to that of Plymouth, and for the very purpose of taking care of, and disbursing that portion of the fund, which of right belongs to the land-owners in Jackson. Instead of one board of trustees, as heretofore, two are to be elected. The fund is a charity—and is to be properly divided among <em>all </em>those entitled to its benefits.</p>
