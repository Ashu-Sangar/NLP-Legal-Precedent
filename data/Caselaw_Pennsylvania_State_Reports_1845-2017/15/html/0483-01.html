If the jury believe that Jacob Geisse agreed with the plaintiff that the lot was paid for by work done or materials furnished under the contract for building the hotel, and the jury may infer this agreement from the declaration of Geisse that the lot belonged to Lykens; and that, in pursuance of this declaration, Lykens took possession of this lot and expended money upon it—the equitable interest in the lot became vested in the plaintiff; and that, in order <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>to recover in this action, the plaintiff is not obliged to show that afterwards he finished the building.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b485-6" data-blocks='[["BL_485.7",485,[141,750,1179,818]]]'>Kidder, J., charged the jury:—The plaintiff claims a lot of ground on Mahantango street, in the borough of Pottsville, thirty feet in front and two hundred and forty feet deep. There is no difficulty in reference to the original title to the lot; and it is admitted to be part of the tract formerly owned' by John Pott, deceased,' which, by proceedings in the Orphans’ Court, was adjudged to his son and heir, William Pott. The plaintiff, by regular conveyances, has brought down the title into Peter Starr. Here the paper title stops, so far as the evidence is concerned. Peter Starr was called by the plaintiff to prove a transfer of the lot to Jacob Geisse; but, it appearing from his statement that the only transfer made by him was by deed, which was neither produced nor accounted for, the court ruled out the evidence. The plaintiff next calls Charles Madara, for the purpose of showing that Geisse was in possession of the lot in question. He states that he put down curbstone in front of the lot, for Geisse; and Peter Starr states that he went on to the lot with Geisse, and he (Geisse) said he would fence it and make a pen for cattle. This is the evidence as to the actual possession of Geisse.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b485-7" data-blocks='[["BL_485.8",485,[137,1568,1179,763]]]'>The plaintiff then introduces an article of agreement between Jacob Geisse and Isaac P. Lykens, bearing date August 8, 1845, for the building a hotel. It appears that Lykens was to pay seven hundred dollars for the lot, in part consideration for building said hotel, according to certain plans, which were made part of the agreement ; but it is expressly stipulated, that “ the said Lykens is not to have any title to the said lot of ground until the completion of the said hotel,” when a good deed was to be made to him by Geisse. The plaintiff then introduces some evidence that Lykens was at work in the fall of 1845 upon the hotel, but it is not shown that he completed it, nor is it proved how much work he did upon it. In connection with this, the plaintiff has shown that after the date of the agreement, Geisse stated to Severn and Reily that he had sold the lot to Lykens, and that Lykens paved the gutter in front of the lot, in pursuance of notice from the borough council, and he claims that the declarations of Geisse, accompanied by the paving of the gutter, independent of the stipulations of the contract, entitle him to recover in this action.</p>

By the terms of his contract with Geisse, he was not to have the title before he had finished the building for which it was part of the consideration. In the mean time, he entered on the lot with Geisse’s assent, and exercised an act of ownership by paving a gutter in front of it, to comply with an ordinance of the borough. Whether he abandoned the possession, or surrendered it to the defendant, does not appear ; but we hear no more of it for three years, when this action was brought. The defendant had, in the mean time, entered and built a valuable house. There was, therefore, very slight evidence of possession, and no evidence of ouster at all. The case would have stood thus even had all the evidence been admitted; and as the defendant might have safely demurred to it, the plaintiff could <em>not </em>be prejudiced by the exclusion of a part of it.</p>
