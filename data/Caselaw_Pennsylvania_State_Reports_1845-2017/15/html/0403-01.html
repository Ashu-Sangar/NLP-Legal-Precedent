Bloom, dated May 21, 1849, a copy whereof is hereunto annexed, and contended that if the auditor should proceed to audit the estate, that then the accountant should not be charged with the whole of the amount of the inventory. It was contended on the part of the accountant that, inasmuch as he produced in evidence said release under the hands and seals <em>of the </em>exceptors, that, therefore, they were estopped from excepting to the account or from alleging that it was incorrect, and that for that reason the account should remain undisturbed by the auditor. ’ The auditor, however, considered the case in another aspect. Sarah Shellenberger, it is true, was the sole legatee under the will of the deceased, and, under the provisions thereof, was entitled to whatever was not required for the payment of debts and funeral expenses. <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>If, however, the debts of decedent should absorb all, then the creditors alone would be interested.</p>

He accordingly corrected them as follows:—It did not appear that the executor had any extraordinary trouble; he therefore considered the commission too high. The estate, however, being small, he considered that the usual percentage would not repay the care and responsibility of the executor, and he therefore allowed him $50, instead of $122.90, which $50, with expenses of audit, amounted to $57.50; and that deducted from $122.90, left $65.40, which difference was what was claimed by counsel for exceptor to be the balance, it being admitted on his part that the personal property delivered to Sarah Shellenberger would equalize the matter in all other respects.</p>
