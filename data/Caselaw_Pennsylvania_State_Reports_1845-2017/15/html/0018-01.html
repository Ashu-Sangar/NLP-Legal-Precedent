The cause was tried before Judge Woodward, at a special court, on the 15th June, 1844: a verdict was rendered for the plaintiff, and damages assessed at $600. A motion was made for a new trial, which was overruled by the judge, and judgment was entered upon the verdict. The defendant took a writ of error to July term 1844, in which a <em>non pros, </em>was entered. A <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued to September term 1844, which was levied upon personal property. The property was appraised, bond executed, and the <em>fi. fa. </em>stayed one year. The defendant took a writ of error to July term 1845. The cause was argued in the Supreme Court, and the judgment affirmed. See 1 <em>Barr </em>176.</p>

The defendant not having paid as required by the extent and notice, an affidavit was filed, and <em>vend, exponas </em>was issued.</p>

      <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>The opinion of Jessup, J., was partly as follows :—The effect of the act of Assembly is to set aside the verdict of the jury, and to reverse the solemn judgment of the Supreme Court, duly pronounced, upon full and learned argument. The legislature have assigned no reasons for this proceeding, but when the situation of the case is considered, it is fair to infer that they intend to establish for the trial of the cause a different rule from that supposed to be settled'by the Supreme Court in the opinion which they delivered. If the Supreme Court are right, why reverse their opinion ? Why grant a new trial? I cannot suppose the legislature intend to arraign the finding of the jury, and upon an ex-parte hearing to grant that which the learned judge who tried the cause, and who had all the facts before his mind, thought he ought not to do.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b19-6" data-blocks='[["BL_19.6",19,[162,974,1180,861]]]'>But, perhaps, in all this I am wrong, and it was only intended to give a new trial upon the facts, and not to interfere with the rule of law, as settled by the Supreme Court. It is, at best, groping in the dark. A future trial is to be in <em>all respects </em>as if the cause had not been tried—of course, as if the Supreme Court had not adjudged the case. The difficulties likely to arise from this species of legislation, might be shown to be much extended beyond those thus intimated. But what has this court to do with any of these questions ? It has been argued before us, that the statute is unconstitutional. But in the case of Menges <em>v. </em>Wertman, 1 <em>Barr </em>228, the Supreme Court have very properly said that “it is‘a grave thing to set aside an act of the representatives of the people, and strange confusion would ensue were it attempted by the county courts or the inferior magistracy.” That the legislature, in this case, exercised the prerogatives of a high court of errors and appeals, is very evident, and whether the Supreme Court will consider them as assuming such judicial powers as are not granted by the constitution, I must leave for them to determine. I trust they will, if they sustain the statute, also determine in what light this court is to regard the previous adjudication by them of this case.</p>

The power to order new trials is judicial; but the power of the legislature is not judicial. It is limited to the making of laws; not to the exposition or execution of them; The functions of the several parts of the government are thoroughly separated, and distinctly assigned to the in’incipal branches of it, the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary, which, within their respective departments, are equal and co-ordinate. Each derives its authority, mediately or immediately, from the people; and each is responsible, mediately or immediately, to the people for the exercise of it. When either shall have usurped the powers of one or both of its fellows, then will have been effected a revolution, not in the form of the government, but in its action. Then will there be a concentration of the powers of the government in a single branch of it, which, whatever may be the form of the constitution, will be a despotism—a government of unlimited, irresponsible, and arbitrary rule. It is idle to say the authority of each branch is defined and limited in the constitution, if there be not an independent power able and willing to enforce the limitations. Experience proves that it is thoughtlessly but habitually violated; and the sacrifice of individual right is too remotely connected with the objects and contests of the masses to attract their attention.</p>
