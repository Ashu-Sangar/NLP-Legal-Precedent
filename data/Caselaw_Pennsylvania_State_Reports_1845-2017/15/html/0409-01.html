The sentence or order of the Court of Quarter Sessions is void by reason of its uncertainty. It does not state to whom the 75 cents per week shall be paid, nor against what the defendant shall indemnify the county. The sentence should be to pay the 75 cents per week to the mother of the child, and to indemnify the county against its support for some definite period, if he fails in the payment of said weekly sum : <a href="/yeates/3/0038-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Yeates 39" data-case-ids="6771259" data-case-paths="/yeates/3/0038-01">3 <em>Yeates </em>39</a>.</p>

The consequence of this omission is that, although the defendants may pay 75 cents per week to the mother until the child is seven years old, yet there may be a breach of the condition of the bond at any future time, should the child become a charge upon the county. The bond in this case imposes a greater burden on the defendants below than the law requires, and is therefore void: Com’th <em>v. </em>Laub, <em>1W. § Ser. </em>261. The condition is to indemnify the county from all expenses, &amp;c., for or by reason of the birth, maintenance, education, or bringing up of said child. The part of this condition which refers to the birth is retrospective, and consequently void. The education of the child was no part of the order of the Court of Quarter Sessions, and that also is"void.</p>

This obligation as to time refers to every matter in, and runs through the whole condition of the bond, and consequently is not severable. It is impossible to sever an indefinite period of time, and restrict the obligation to some definite period by an indefinite sentence. There is nothing upon the record to sever this condition by. And the only end there can be to this obligation is the death of the child, which may not be within seven years. This is certainly a heavier burden than the law will impose upon these defendants : Beacom et al. <em>v. </em>Holmes; Cochran et al. <em>v. </em>McKnight, 13 <em>Ser. $ B. </em>190; McKee et al. <em>v. </em>Stannard, 14 <em>Ser. $ B. </em>380.</p>

The condition of the bond is to indemnify the county from all expenses for or by reason of the birth, maintenance, education or bringing up of said child. This means that the defendant shall pay for the lying-in expenses, and the 75 cents per week for the maintenance of the child, or indemnify the county for having to pay those expenses. The education of the child is explained by the subsequent words, <em>or bringing up </em>of said child. Education does not here mean a scholastic instruction, but is used in its general sense, which Webster defines to be “all that series of instruction and discipline which is intended to enlighten the understanding, correct the temper, and form the manners and habits of youth, and fit them for usefulness in their future stations.”</p>

This, however, is no_t a fatal defect, as we will intend it to be payable, either to the mother or to another, who, in <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>case of her decease, may take her place. It was not regarded as error in Goddard <em>v. </em>Com’th, 6 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>284, where the sentence was in the same form, and adjudged to be good. Nor do we perceive any thing exceptionable in the condition of the bond, which it is believed is in the usual form and according to the most approved precedents. The condition of the bond is to indemnify the county from all expenses for or by the reason of the birth, maintenance, <em>education </em>or bringing up of said ehild. This unquestionably means that the defendant shall pay to the mother, or any other person entitled to receive it, the lying-in expenses, and the seventy-five cents a week for the maintenance of the child, or indemnify the county for having to pay those expenses. It is said the education of the child is not part of the sentence; and in words it is not: yet it is part of the condition of the bond which he was ordered to give. The education, to which the condition refers, perhaps does not mean his scholastic instruction; but if it did, I should see no objection to it on that account, in a country which depends for its very existence on the intelligence of its citizens. ' It may rather mean his moral culture, which certainly ought not to be left wholly neglected. Education means the instruction of children—all that series of instruction and discipline which is intended to enlighten the understanding, correct the temper, and form the manners and habits of youth, and fit them for usefulness in their future stations. The ehild is innocent, whatever may be the guilt of its parents, and it is but right it should receive justice at least, from the hands of those who are bound by law and every natural and religious duty to nourish and support it. The words, from time to time and at all times hereafter, are restricted by the time previously mentioned, viz. until the child attained the age of seven years. This is the obvious meaning of the bond, taken as a whole, and we are indisposed to construe it in detached parts. This, we agree, is a statutory <em>bond; </em>but, as we perceive no more onerous condition than the law imposes, we are of opinion the bond is good.</p>
