The second suit was for the same cause, was entitled an alias, and so marked on the record; and this, as it has been held, is so connected and linked with the first as to be a continuation or reiteration of the original, and so indissolubly connected as to be one; and that, so far as the statute is concerned, it stops running from the institution of the first process. <em>We </em>will not say that the demand might not be barred, if the plaintiff delayed six years before issuing his <em>alias. </em>That will be a question not presented here.</p>
