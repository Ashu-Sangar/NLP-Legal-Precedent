The first communication from Barnum to them, appears to have been dated 3d February, 1844, informing them of a consignment of produce; and the letter was accompanied by a bill of lading, and informing them of a draft drawn for $550, at 60 days from the 5th inst. Other letters of a similar' character were afterwards received, usually accompanied by a bill of lading. Sibbett &amp; Jones usually discounted the bills- of exchange, and, at the end of about a month, were the holders of three bills of exchange .for five hundred dollars each, which Craig, Bellas &amp; Co. refused to accept, on the ground that Barnum had not complied with his agreement to send produce to cover the drafts. One of the firm of Sibbett &amp; Jones had one or more interviews with Craig, one of the defendants below, in <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>relation to a certain draft, drawn by Barnum in favor of Sibbett &amp; Jones, which Craig refused to accept without being put in possession of property.

In some instances, at least, the bills of lading were forwmrded by Sibbett &amp; Jones to Craig, Bellas &amp; Co. But on the 10th, 16th, and 20th of May, three drafts, drawn by Barnum and discounted by Sibbett &amp; Jones, were forwarded by them to Craig, Bellas &amp; Co., and were accompanied or followed by bills of lading, purporting to be for produce shipped by Barnum, but were in reality false and fraudulent, no such merchandise being in existence. Craig, Bellas &amp; Co. accepted drafts on the faith of the bills of lading, and refused payment on discovering that the latter were fraudulent, and this gave rise to this controversy.</p>

It is of no consequence whether they knew or not of the arrangement between Barnum and the defendants. It is of no consequence that they became holders of the bill before it was accepted. There is no evidence that they had any knowledge of the fraud committed by Barnum, or participated in it at all, even innocently; for the bill was transmitted for acceptance by Barnum, and in doing so, he is not to be considered as acting as agent for the plaintiffs, but on his own account as drawer of the bill. It was the business of the defendants to inquire and satisfy themselves, before they accepted the bill, that property or funds to meet it had been remitted. Had they done so and refused to accept, the plaintiffs would have had the opportunity at once to take measures for their own security. We have no evidence as to the precise time when the fraud was discovered, and whether any, and if any, at what time notice of it was given to the plaintiffs. As between Barnum and defendants the defence here set up would be perfectly valid: but, if the plaintiffs paid a valuable consideration for the bill, and took it in good faith, without any knowledge of or participation in the fraud of Barnum, they .have a right to recover.</p>

They knew it was drawn against flour supposed to have been shipped in a regular course of dealing between the drawer and the acceptors; but they had discounted other bills between the parties, which were paid at maturity; and if they had not, they would have had no reason to <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>suspect that a fraud was meditated by the drawer in this particular instance. Yet' he did meditate a fraud, and perpetrated it by procuring the signature of the master to a bill of lading of flour which â–  was never put on-board. With participation in this, it is attempted to charge the plaintiffs; but with how little reason, a simple statement of the facts is suffleient to show. The only additional matter is that the bill of lading was endorsed to the plaintiffs as a security in case of non-acceptance, and that it was presented to the defendants with the bill of exchange; whence an argument that, as the plaintiffs were apprized of the course of dealing, they must have known the acceptance was on a tacit condition that the flour should be forwarded. Has it ever been supposed that the purchaser of a bill drawn against cotton to be shipped to Liverpool is bound to guaranty the delivery of it ? The plaintiffs were not party to the shipment; nor did they interfere in respect to it. It is said that though the acceptance was absolute in form, they must, from the nature of the transaction, have understood it to be conditional in substance. The administrator, in thÃ© Bank of Ireland <em>v. </em>Bellsford, did not intend to make himself personally liable by his unqualified acceptance, but the law intended that he did. The cases show that the payee looks only to the terms of the acceptance; and that when he has acted in good faith, he is not to be prejudiced by the acts of the drawer. The latter is liable to him on the bill, and the drawee on his contract of acceptance; but he stands in no privity to them in any transaction between themselves. According to the cited case of Reynolds <em>v. </em>Robinson, which goes far to rule the present, it was the duty of the defendants to accept absolutely or refuse absolutely, in order that the plaintiffs might look to their relations with the drawer; and it determines the point that it is immaterial whether the endorsement of the bill of lading were before or after the acceptance of the bill of-exchange.</p>
