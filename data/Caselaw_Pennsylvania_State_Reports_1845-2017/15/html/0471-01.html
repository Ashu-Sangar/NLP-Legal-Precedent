In this case, the will was executed on the 27th of September, 1828, and the testator died on the 24th of April, 1849, and the question is whether the act of Assembly was intended to operate on wills made and executed before the passage of the act. The words are—“ No devise or legacy hereafter made,” &amp;c. When is the devise or legacy made ? at the execution of the will or at the death of the testator ? In <em>Ram on Wills, </em>8 <em>Law Lib. </em>108, it. is said that <em>“ </em>it is true that a will speaks from the death of the testator: but what does it speak ? Does it say more than what the testator said when he made his will? Were it permitted to say more, clearly the law would fulfil an intention which is not expressed in it.” And again, on page 107, it is said that the intent of a testator is to be taken as things stood at the time when the will was made, subject to the right of the testator to anticipate events.</p>

Under that act, the construction given by the court <a id="p475" href="#p475" data-label="475" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*475</a>might perhaps be sustained; but the act of 1844 evidently relates <em>to the execution of the instrument </em>creating or making the devise or legacy. But if the question depend upon authority, the case of Mullock <em>v. </em>Souder, 5 <em>W. $ Ser. </em>198, we think, is in point, and rules the matter. In that case, it is said “ that the court will never give an act of Assembly a retroactive effect, when'such does not expressly appear to be the design of the legislature ; but the act will be left to operate on wills made and executed after the act comes into operation.” He contended that as to <em>personal </em>estate, the will is ambulatory ; but as to real estate, it speaks from the date of the will; that the right of the devisee is then fixed.</p>

It is contended on behalf of the plaintiffs in error, that it matters not whether the estate devised was real or personal; but the estate <em>was land at the execution of the will, </em>and was a conveyance to the executors in trust for the devisees. In Mullock <em>v. </em>Souder, the judge says that a devise of real estate is in the nature of a conveyance, and a statute will not be considered as altering the effect of a conveyance already made, so as to pass more than it purported to pass when made. A retroactive effect will not be given to a statute so as to affect contracts or property. In the present case, the language of the act is prospective, and the courts always hesitate, even if an act is retroactive, to sanction it, if it interfere in any way with vested rights.

We concede that the intention governs, except where the law overrules such intention. The intention must he consistent with the rules of law; for, if it he in opposition, courts will disregard it: Girard <em>v. </em>City of Philadelphia, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Rawle%20328" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="4 Rawle 328">4 <em>Rawle </em>328</a>; City of Philadelphia <em>v. </em>Davis, 1 <em>Whar; </em>490. In <em>Ram on Wills </em>108, it is laid down, that the <em>effect </em>of a will may be changed by events that may happen after its publication and before the testator’s death. And so also, we think, may its legal effect be changed by any subsequent statutory provision affecting its construction, either by enlarging or restraining the operation of particular words used in it, or by any other enactment which the legislature may make. In the present case, however, there will be no violation of any rule of construction founded on intention, in deciding that this residuary interest has not lapsed. It will be merely carrying out the testator’s intention ; for, when he bequeathed the residuum to his brothers, David and Isaiah Warner, his intention, doubtless, was to vest it in them and their issue, and to exclude the rest of his heirs at law from any interest in it. This intention is made more manifest by the fact that, ‘filthough he lived five years after the passage of the act of 1844, he made <em>no alteration in his will; </em>being, no doubt, satisfied that the act would effectuate his intention.</p>

Thus, if the bequest be general, as of all the testator’s goods <em>in </em>a particular house or place, whatever personal chattels are found there at the time of his death will pass, though not there at the date of the will: Sager <em>v. </em>Sager; 2 <em>Vern. </em>588; 1 <em>Rop. Leg. </em>220, 3d ed.; Cambridge <em>v. </em>Rous, 8 <em>Ves. </em>25. Before the death of the testator, the will is a mere <em>intention </em>to dispose of property in a particular manner, which, so far as regards any legal effect the expression of such intention can have, might as well exist unexpressed in the mind of the testator, as in any paper-writing which he may make. It is not within the control of the law; and it is only death which gives it legal vitality. The law looks not beyond the death; and it is on this principle that it has been held, in Elcock’s Will, <a href="/scl/15/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="4 McCord 39" data-case-ids="8856931" data-case-paths="/scl/15/0039-01">4 <em>McCord </em>39</a>, that a will executed in the presence of two witnesses, as required by the law existing at its publication, cannot be admitted to probate if the law <a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>has been changed before the testator’s death, so as to require three attesting witnesses. The converse of the proposition is expressly ruled in Long <em>v. </em>Zook, 1 <em>Harris </em>400, where it was held that a will made before the act of 1848, but the death occurring after, the case was within the remedial provisions of that statute, because no estate vested in the testator’s lifetime. But it is needless to elaborate this point; for, if a will of personal estate <em>speaks </em>from the death of the testator, it necessarily follows that it must also be <em>spoken </em>to by the law existing at that time.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b477-5" data-blocks='[["BL_477.5",477,[157,793,1170,857]]]'>But the plaintiffs further contend, that this was a devise of real estate, in trust for the legatees; and therefore that the rule of law, which considers a devise of real estate as a conveyance or an appointment to a use, operating by relation to the time of its execution, must govern in the construction of this will. Since the act of 1838, see. 8, which provides that after-acquired real estate shall pass by a general devise, unless a contrary intention be manifest on the face of the will, the reason of the rule' for treating devises as conveyances no longer exists ; and it is suggested whether the rule itself has now, in consequence of this statutory metachronism, any application in Pennsylvania. But be this as it may, this case is not within the rule. So far as regards the legatees, it is not a devise of real estate, but a bequest of personalty.

That case has reference exclusively to a devise of <em>real </em>estate; and it is on the ground that such a devise is a conveyance of the real estate at the time of the execution of the will, that the court held that after-acquired real estate would not pass by it, notwithstanding the testator died after the act of 1833. Judge Sergeant, in delivering the opinion, says, “ A devise of real estate is in the nature of a conveyance; and a statute will not be considered as altering the effect of a conveyance already made, so as to pass more than it purported to pass when made.” This rule, however, has no application to the present case; for it is not a devise or conveyance of land to the legatees, but a bequest of money, which takes effect only on the death of the testator. The act of 1844, it is not pretended, has any retroactive operation, for there is nothing for the law to act upon before the death of the testator. Until that event happens, the legatees have neither legal existence nor <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>rights.

Taken as either one or the other, the legacies lapse, and consequently the judgment must he reversed. Before the act of 1810,'a legacy even to a child or other lineal descendant lapsed by the death of the legatee or devisee. This, which was supposed to disappoint the intention of the testator, was remedied by that act. But this did not extend to a devise or bequest to a collateral relation, as to a brother or nephew; and consequently, under that act, this case would not admit of a question. But by the act of the 6th May, 1844, <em>Dunlop </em>922, the legislature further provided that no devise or legacy <em>hereafter made </em>in favor of a brother or sister of any testator, such testator not leaving any lineal descendants, shall be deemed or held to lapse, or become void, by reason of the decease of such devisee or legatee, in the lifetime of the testator, if such devisee or legatee shall leave issue surviving the testator; but such devise or legacy shall he good and available, in favor of such surviving issue, with like effect as if such devisee or legatee had survived, saving always to any testator the right to direct otherwise.</p>

The question is, did the legislature intend that the act should operate on wills executed before its passage, the death happening after, so as to change, by the construction, the legal intention of the testator ? For I agree, if this intention clearly appear, it must be so construed; it would interfere with no vested right, as the testator is saved the power of directing otherwise. It, however, strikes me, that the intention must be most clearly expressed", in language which it is difficult to misapprehend; and such is the doctrine held in Mullock <em>v. </em>Souder, 5 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>198. Mr. Justice Sergeant says, a retroactive effect will not be given to a statute unless such appears expressly to he the design of the t-estater. Mullock <em>v. </em>Souder, it is true, is the case of real estate; and as this is assumed to he personal property, it does not in terms rule this <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>case. Nor is it in this case cited for that purpose, but for the sake of the principle decided, which is as applicable to personal as real estate. Nothing appears, but rather the reverse, in the act of 1844, indicating any intention to give it a retrospective effect. No devise or legacy <em>hereafter made, </em>is the phraseology of the act; thereby meaning, according to the usual acceptation of language, wills made and executed after the passage of the act. If they had designed otherwise, it would have been easy to express their meaning in plain and unambiguous terms. But, it is said, that it is a well settled rule that a will of personal property is considered as having existence only from the death of the testator, and not from the time of its execution. All the personal estate which a man has at the time of his death passes by his will, although acquired after the time of its execution: <em>Williams on Executors </em>6; <a href="/scl/15/0039-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 McCord 39" data-case-ids="8856931" data-case-paths="/scl/15/0039-01">4 <em>McCord </em>39</a>; <a href="/scl/14/0491-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="3 McCord 491" data-case-ids="8861852" data-case-paths="/scl/14/0491-01">3 <em>McCord </em>491</a>. Thus, if a bequest be general, as of all the testator’s goods <em>in </em>a particular house or place, whatever personal chattels are found there at the time of his death will pass, though not there at the date of the will: Sager <em>v. </em>Sager, 2 <em>Vern. </em>588; 1 <em>Roper Leg. </em>220; and in Cambridge <em>v. </em>Rous, 8 <em>Ves. </em>25, Sir William Grant held, that a residuary bequest of personal estate covers not only every thing not disposed of, but every thing that in the event turns out not to be disposed of. That there is a difference in that respect, I am not disposed to deny. Indeed, the rule as to personal property is absolutely necessary, arising from perplexity involved in deciding otherwise; as the difficulty would be almost insurmountable of distinguishing that which was possessed before or after the execution of the will. Hence it is with great propriety referred to the time of the death. But, although this is conceded, yet I have failed to see the application of those conceded principles. The question is not as to the <em>corpus </em>of the bequest or its extent, but the difficulty is as to the legatee who is to take. At the time the will was executed, his brothers and sisters only were designated; to them only was the bequest made. They alone were in the eye of the testator; they alone were the objects of his bounty; not another single human being. This cannot be disputed; but since the will was executed the legislature have thought proper to say, that in case of their death, their children, without being named or referred to, shall be substituted, or, in other words, persons whom he had not thought of shall enjoy his bounty. Now, as before remarked, I do not deny the constitutional power of the legislature to give the will this <em>construction; </em>but is it going too far to require that such intention shall be expressed in such clear, unambiguous terms as to preclude all hesitation and doubt. It is in my judgment giving the act a retroactive effect, which, as is ruled in the case cited, Mullock <em>v. </em>Souder, will not be permitted, unless such appears expressly to be the design of the legislature. Though a will, it is true,, does not take effect till after the testator’s death, <a id="p480" href="#p480" data-label="480" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*480</a>yet it is inchoate, though not consummate, from the execution of it, and for many purposes in law, of which this is one, it relates to the time of the making of it: 7 <em>Bac. Air. </em>340, note 1; <em>P. Wms. </em>97.</p>

That the testator permitted his -will to stand without alteration for several years, or that he may have known of the act of 1844, is nothing. It is a question of construction, depending on certain fixed principles, which ought not to be varied by fancied speculations as to the knowledge or ignorance of testators, some of whom may, or others may not know of the statute and its legal construction.</p>
