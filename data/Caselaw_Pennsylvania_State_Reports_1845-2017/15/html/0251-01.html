That on the 5th day of June, 1849, at a stated meeting of the corporation, the said committee reported, “ that they had attended to the duty assigned to them, and after hearing both the complainant, as well as the party charged, they find that John G-. Fischer is fully guilty of the charges preferred against him, and the committee further recommend that the 29th article of the charter of incorporation be enforced.” That the said report was adopted, and the committee discharged from the further consideration of the subject. Whereupon, a motion was made to expel John G. Fischer, and to strike his name from the list of members, which was decided by ballot, in the affirmative. The president of the corporation then declared the said John G. Fischer expelled, and ordered the messenger to inform him of his expulsion.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b253-6" data-blocks='[["BL_253.6",253,[167,697,1169,590]]]'>The fifth and sixth causes of demurrer are, that it is not shown that the relator had notice to appear and defend himself, and that he was not heard in his defence before the society. It appears that a committee of investigation was appointed, who proceeded to inquire into the charge, not on the oaths of credible witnesses, but by hearing the allegations of the complainant and the accused; that they made a report to the society, which was adopted, and immediately thereafter, without any notice to the relator, or giving him a chance of making a defence, he was expelled. This was not only a clear violation of the law of the land, but of the charter of the society, which expressly provides “that the party charged shall always have the right of Being heard in his defence, be confronted with the witnesses against him, and of producing evidence in his favor.”</p>
