        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nGibson, C. J.\nLand is a chattel for payment of debts only when the law has made it a fund for that purpose. It then has undergone a species of conversion, so far as may be necessary to the purpose of \u2022 satisfaction, which extinguishes every derivative interest in it which cannot consist with the qualities it has been made to assume. Thus, a judgment, or a mortgage, binds it and converts it; and it is seized as personal property, on a fieri faeias, which commands the sheriff to levy the debt off the defendant\u2019s goods and chattels. We readily compreh\u00e9nd how a sale on a judgment, a mortgage, or an order of the Orphans\u2019 Court, passes the land freed from dower; but the reason is not so obvious why a sale under a testamentary power, created in good faith, for the benefit of creditors, should do so. It is because the law makes a decedent\u2019s land a fund for payment of his debts, by giving the creditors a lien on it, which might be enforced by judicial process, and would extinguish the widow\u2019s dower in it. It would come to the same thing in the end, and she is consequently not injured by a process substituted by the husband to produce exactly the same result. But a sale without any species of legal constraint, whether immediate or remote, rests on a different foundation, and is attended with different, consequences. Dower would be altogether insecure, if the husband might bar it by a voluntary sale, for payment of a debt, however small, even when incurred to serve for a pretext. For that reason, it was ruled in Eberle v. Fisher, 1 Harris 526, \u201cthat a husband\u2019s assignment in insolvency does not divest his wife\u2019s dower in the land, inasmuch as it was not, at the time, in the gripe of his creditors. In the present case, the husband was free to do with it what he pleased, but always in subordination to the incipient estate of his .wife. Had he sold it himself, and paid his debts with the price of it, her dower would have remained in it; and his sale can have no other effect when made by the instrumentality of trustees appointed and empowered by him.\nJudgment affirmed.",

    "head_matter": "Helfrich versus Obermyer.\nA voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors, by the husband alone, and the subsequent sale and conveyance by his assignees, does not divest his wife's right of dower in the land assigned.\nError to the Common Pleas of Union county.\nThis was an action of dower, brought by Elizabeth Obermyer against Josiah Helfrich, to recover dower out of a tract of land in Beaver township, which was once the property of her late husband, Michael Obermyer, now deceased. \u25a0\nThe only question raised by the case stated was, whether Josiah Helfrich held the land discharged from Elizabeth Obermyer\u2019s right of dower; or, in other words, whether a sale of land by an assignee under a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors, divests the right of dower of the wife, after the death of the assignor ?\nA case stated was agreed upon.\nIt is agreed by the parties in the above case to submit it to the court on the following statement of facts, in the nature of a special verdict, reserving the right to either party to remove the case to the Supreme Court by writ of error.\nThe plaintiff, Elizabeth Obermyer, was duly married to Michael Obermyer, now deceased, about the year-, and continued to be his lawful wife until some time in the year 1848, when he, the said Michael, died intestate. Previous to the 18th November, 1842, the said Michael became sensed of a certain tract of land, situate in Beaver township, in said county, adjoining lands of Daniel Zeiber and others, containing 114 acres and 120 perches, strict measure. On the aforesaid 18th November, 1842, and during the continuance of the coverture of the said Elizabeth, the said Michael Obermyer executed an assignment of all his estate, both real and personal, to George Miller and Adam Smith, in trust for the benefit of his creditors, (front said assignment,) which assignment was duly acknowledged and recorded according to law, on the 80th November, 1842. The said George Miller and Adam Smith accepted the trust conferred by said assignment, and on the 16th December, 1842, filed in the prothonotary\u2019s office a bond duly executed and approved of, conditioned for the faithful execution of the trust, together with an inventory of the lands, goods-, &c., of the said Michael Obermyer, including the aforesaid tract of land.\nIn execution of the said trust, the said George Miller and Adam Smith, sold the said tract of land to Elias Aurand, in consideration of $2115, and executed and delivered to the said Aurand a deed therefor, dated the 12th of March, 1845. On the 19th day of February, 1846, the said George Miller and Adam Smith, as assignees aforesaid, exhibited in the prothonotary\u2019s office an account of their trust, in which they have charged themselves with the amount of the inventory. Exceptions were filed to said account, and thereupon the court referred it to an auditor, who made a report,' which was read and confirmed nisi on the 14th December, 1846. On the 14th December, 1848, George Miller, one of the said assignees, exhibited in the prothonotary\u2019s office a final account of said trust, which became absolutely confirmed on the 19th of February, 1849.\nAfter the purchase of the said tract of land as aforesaid, the said Aurand, together with Esther, his wife, on the 10th November, 1845, conveyed the same 'to Daniel Swaager, who, together with his wife Elizabeth, on the 19th day of May, 1848, conveyed the same to Josiah Helfrich, the defendant in the above stated action, and who is now in possession.\nNow, if, from the foregoing state of facts, the court shall be of opinion that the said Elizabeth Obermyer is entitled to dower in the land described, then judgment to be entered for the plaintiff; but if they should be of opinion that her dower has been divested, then judgment to be entered for the defendant.\nThe court below rendered judgment on the case stated, for the plaintiff.\nError was assigned to the entry of judgment.\nSlenJcer, for Helfrich, plain tiffin error.\nIn Pennsylvania, lands have always been held as chattels for the payment of debts: Andrew v.
