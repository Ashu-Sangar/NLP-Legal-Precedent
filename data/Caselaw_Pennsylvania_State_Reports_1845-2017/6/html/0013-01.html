The will was written on 26th May, 1840, but not executed until 27th. In writing the will, he first bequeathed a house and two lots he owned in town to Mrs. Sturm. To Mrs. Dunbar he bequeathed a house and lot — to Mrs. Sentman $1000. Then he came to John, [defendant.] He studied awhile, and said he did not give John Eckert quite so much as the others, or to that amount — that he had a $2000 bond that he intended to make a present to him, or rather he said <em>bonds </em>in his way of talk. I then proceeded on and wrote that far in the will, and then asked him if I should mention in the will the $2000 to John. He said no, but <a id="p15" href="#p15" data-label="15" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*15</a>I should insert the $1000 and leave the bond out. He said <em>bonds— </em>can’t say particularly an instance whether he said <em>bonds </em>or bond. He then said that the <em>bonds were in the chest, mid they might easily be got and put out of the way. </em>.Then I told him, perhaps, Doctor, you had better wait till to-morrow, perhaps you will be better able. He looked pretty well that day. I was not willing to go to the chest to take out the bonds. There were persons coming in and out, and I thought some person might come in, and think I was making too free, and that I might create some excitement among them by my going to his papers. He then said perhaps he would be better, that he then felt tolerably well. Then I went on and finished out the remaining part of John’s bequeath. About the time I finished John’s bequeath, he was very anxious and did not want anybody to know it. Some one came in, he ordered me to slip the will under the quilt and go down stairs. When I came up stairs again, he again mentioned the $2000 <em>bond </em>or <em>bonds. </em>He said he should do something with them. I then told him better he should wait till next day. He allowed then we should put it off — put off getting the <em>bonds.. </em>He then told me he had bought the mill property for John, or rather talked it over about John — said he had bought the property for John, and John could make a very handsome living on the property if he would take care. He said if John would mind his business he never intended to charge him for the property. I then went on from that and finished the will according to his directions. Then I took the will with me into my end of the house — we both-lived under one roof. I was then not in to see him till dark the same day. I then went up to see him. I stayed some time with him and left him. Nothing said then about the will or <em>bonds. </em>Between four and five o’clock the next morning I was called for and went to him. He said he felt very bad, and that the will should be finished. I then asked who he was going to appoint executors, &amp;c. We then left the room. I did not go up to his room again till toward noon. He then seemed to want to say something to me; I'went close to him;’he spoke very low. He then said that you know what I said about <em>those bonds. </em>That was the last I spoke to him and the last I think he did speak — that was, “ you know what <em>I said about those bonds.” </em>The day before he had spoke to me about getting the <em>bonds out of the chest, for the purpose of having them destroyed.</em>

That the day of or the day before his death, Dr. Eckert again said that John should have the property clear of all encumbrances, and $1000.

I asked him why he held these bonds if he did not intend to collect <em>them; </em>he said he held them, that 'if John did not do as well as he ought to do, he would have the first chance of recovering the property; that others could not come in and take it from him. I told him it was wrong to hold these bonds if he did not intend John to pay them; that he might be called off suddenly some day, and this might operate seriously against John.

He said then he intended to give his property to those who would not be unthankful; he said he had bought a mill and sold it to his nephew John, merely a form, he meant to give it to him.

It is certain he would not admit parol evidence to control the will. Such is the principle of Tufnel <em>v. </em>Constable, 8 Simon, 69 ; and Doyle <em>v. </em>Blake, 2 Scho. &amp; Lef. 240. Nor to raise, but only to rebut an equity; and such ivas the rule in Fordyce <em>v. </em>Willes, 3 Br. C. C. 377; Freemantle <em>v. </em>Banks, 5 Ves. 79; and Monck <em>v. </em>Lord Monck, 1 Ball &amp; Beatty, 298. But it certainly may be used by an executor, provided for by a legacy, to rebut the equity of the next of kin; or by the next of kin, to repel the rebutting evidence of the executor. A list of authorities for this, which it would be tedious to repeat, is to be found in the notes to Stephenson <em>v. </em>Heathcote, 1 Eden’s Rep. 40, 41. In like manner, parol evidence was received in Monck <em>v. </em>Lord Monck, to' fortify a presumption of ademption. For these purposes, it is settled that parol evidence of the testator’s declarations, before, at, and after the publication of the will, is competent; and how stands the case on this record ? We are on a plea to an action on a bond, it is true; but if the debt has been equitably discharged, a chancellor would enjoin the executors as readily as he would decree against them on a bill for the legacy. Indeed the case of Aston <em>v. </em>Pye, 5 Ves. 350, in note, was an action at law on a note endorsed, <em>“ </em>Henry Pye pays no interest, nor shall I even take tli <a id="p19" href="#p19" data-label="19" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*19</a>principal unless greatly distressed;” and'this endorsement, though not a testamentary act, was held by the Common Pleas, to which the case had been sent by tfie Master'of the Rolls for atrial at law, to be a discharge. In Byrne v. Godfrey, 4 Ves. 9, Lord Loughborough expressed something like dissatisfaction at,the decision of that case; but in Eden v. Smith, 5 Ves. 354, he expressed his concurrence. But to say no more of the question at law, what would be the defence to a bill in the presént case ? The legacy, purporting to be a benefit to the legatee, would be demandable in.the first . instance; and to encounter it, the executors would be .driven to the bonds, which would not, <em>prima </em>facie, appear to be discharged by' the will. But the presumption that no 'release was intended when a debt stands against a legacy, may, like' any other presumption, be rebutted by proof arising either on the face of 'the. will, or dehors. It. is not adduced to control the will, .but to rebut a. presumption from matter extrinsic to it; and its competency to do so is established, not only, by the eases I have quoted for the general 'principle, but' particularly by* Eden v. Smith, to which I have referred for Lord Loughbororigh’s opinion of Aston v. Pye and which, if- it be law, rules the very point before us. A father, who had taken two bonds from his daughter’s husband, for money lent, said in a letter to the husband’s mother, that the debt was forgiven, and expressed thé same thing to others, whose testimony was corroborated by cash accounts in the testator’s handwriting; and the chancellor decreed, not only payment of the legacy, but that the other.bónd should nojfc be demanded.' I am aware that the-propriety qf the decision was doubted by Lord Eldon in Pole v. Somers, 6 Ves. 322, but he did'not venture to say it was not law. Notwithstanding the weight of that greatf man’s name, I am. unable to entertain-a similar doubt. What was the .object of the extrinsic evidence, but to rebut a presumption in- the interpretation- of a will; and that it is competent to do so, is an elementary principle guarded from abuse by the consideration that the' court never decrees on the basis of it when the- fact is at all in doubt. ’ The sum of the matter is, that, though-a parol discharge without consideration is bad, a testamentary discharge without it, is good: that the legal presumption of an intention not to discharge' a debt which arises from a naked legacyGo the debtor, may be rebutted-by extrinsic proof; and that the presumption being first ’rebutted by it, the will, and not the proof, operates the discharge, The distinction may be a subtle one, but on ifr only can the preceding decisions be sustained; and they are too numerous to be overturned. <a id="p20" href="#p20" data-label="20" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*20</a>Now it appears in the proofs before us, that the testator, having no issue, received the defendant John, his nephew, into his house as an adopted child at the death of his father; and that he raised him from early infancy to manhood, entertaining for him the affection of a father. To one person he said, that he meant to leave his property to those who would not be unthankful for it, and that he had bought a mill and sold it to John for form’s sake: to another, that he might as well charge much as little for it, as John would get it any how; and if he charged him high, John would try to work through. To another he said, that he would make a man of John; and that he should have the property clear, with 1000 dollars — the amount of the legacy subsequently given. Remonstrating with the county commissioners against the amount of tax assessed on his securities, he said that he did not look to payment of John’s bonds, as he held them only to get the property back, if John should not do well; but that he would take care that no one should collect them after his death. To carry out his purpose, he instructed the person who wrote his will, to insert in it a legacy of 1000 dollars to John, saying that the bonds were in his chest, and could be easily got at and put out of the way. ■ This person testified that, being unwilling to go to the' chest, as persons were frequently passing through the room, who might think he was taking an improper liberty, he advised the testator to wait till the next day; and that he consented to do so, but again mentioned the-bonds, and said the witness should do something with them. The will was executed the next morning; at noon he whispered to the witness: “You know what I said about the bonds,” — and died. Surely if ever there was a case of disappointed intention made clear by extrinsic evidence, this is one. The testator did every thing in his power to annul these bonds, and died in a confident belief that he had done enough. The case is decisively stronger than Eden <em>v. </em>Smith; and the urgency of it indicates its principle. Every allowance is to be made, in this as in every other respect, for the ignorance and helplessness of men in the article of death. The presumption that John’s legacy was intended to be a clear gratuity, which was repelled in the first instance by the production of his bonds; was restored by the parol proofs of an intention to release them which had been frustrated by accident, which is a distinct head of equitable relief. The will then becomes a release; and it was shown that the executors ought not to recover. Judgment affirmed.</p>
