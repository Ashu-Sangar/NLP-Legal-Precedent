On the 19th of January, 1833, Christopher Medler drew an accommodation note in favour of Biah Gilson or order, for the payment of $1116 12|-, at ninety days. The note was endorsed by Gilson, and discounted by the bank for the benefit of Medler, and not being paid at maturity, was protested and.due notice given to Gilson. The bank brought suit against Gilson to April Term, 1836, and obtained a judgment on the 14th of November following. The declaration having been lost, the plaintiff proved by H. W. Smith, Esq., the attorney of the bank, that he drew the declaration, and that he declared on the nóte before mentioned. To the testimony of Mr. Smith the defendants objected, on the ground that the record could not be supplied by parol proof. The court overruled the objection', admitted the evidence, and sealed a bill of exception. To August Term, 1840, the bank sued out a <em>scire facias </em>to revive their judgment, and the same was revived on the 11th of January, 184-1, and to August Term, 1841, a writ of <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued against Gilson. On the 1th of October, 1841, Gilson paid the bank the principal and interest of the judgment, and the execution was then returned stayed and costs paid. At the time the note was discounted, Medler held sixty shares of stock in the bank, upon which, $30 per share had -been paid, subject to the payment of the, remaining $20 on each share, which stock still stands in Medler’s name upon the books of the bank. The dividends declared on this stock, from May, 1833, to November, 1842, amounted to $1206, and were still retained by the bank. This sum of $1206, the plaintiff claimed to recover in this suit. At the time Gilson paid the bank, he notified them that he claimed Medler’s stock and dividends, and claimed to be substituted to all the rights of the bank against Medler. Medler, by a power of attorney dated 29th of October, 1842, authorized Robert M. Barr, Esq., to transfer his sixty shares of stock to James Medler-, and by an assignment dated 24th of July, 1843, he assigned the dividends to David Barnett. Mr. Barr called at the bank with the power of attorney, to make the transfer, and Mr. Barnett subse<a id="p53" href="#p53" data-label="53" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*53</a>quently with his assignment to receive the dividends. The bank refused to permit the transfer or to pay the dividends, on account of the notice given by Gilson. James Medler then brought suit against the bank, for not allowing the transfer' to be made; and David Barnett instituted a suit for the dividends.</p>

At this time, Medler owned and held sixty shares of the stock of said bank, on each share of which 30 dollars had been paid; he held said stock subject to the payment of 20 dollars, in addition to that already paid on each share.</p>

This very security may have inspired confidence in Gil-son to become his endorser, who after all was but a surety; it may have been so far relied on by him, as lo prevent his taking any other security for his own indemnity. Honesty and good morals forbade the bank from doing any thing that would have impaired this security, or made it less available.

This right is not founded as much in contract as it is upon the principles of natural and substantial justice; a demand of a transfer when the money is paid is enough; if it is refused, it stands in equity as if it was already done.

No reasons are given for these decisions ; the principle is not examined; it is merely asserted that such evidence was competent. A record, it is said, imports absoluto verity, and incontrovertible credit; parol proof in relation to it is forbidden; no plea, averment, or proof, can be received to contradict, alter, or vary it. If mistake or fraud be alleged, application must be made to the court where the proceeding or judgment is had, to have it corrected, and the record, as corrected, will be the only true record; Morris <em>v. </em>Galbraith, <a href="/watts/8/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Watts 166" data-case-ids="1848529" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0166-01">8 Watts, 166</a>; Hoffman <em>v. </em>Coster, <a href="/whart/2/0453-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Whart. 453" data-case-ids="1830584" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0453-01">2 Whart. 453</a>. To make out a record altogether by parol proof is far more dangerous than to vary it by this kind of evidence ; the reasons of the court in the cases cited forbid the one as much as the other. Application should be made to the court in which the record remains to supply it; as in the case where fraud or mistake is alleged. In Hamilton <em>v. </em>Vanswearingen, Addison, 48, parol evidence of the contents of a lost deed was refused, because the party might have obtained a deed of confirmation, or an order of court under the act of 1786.
