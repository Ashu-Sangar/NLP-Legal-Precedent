The plaintiff was the owner of a tract of land through which the stream run on which was his grist-mill. The defendant was the owner of the land above, on the same stream, on which he built a saw-mill, and made a dam across the stream, for the purpose of <a id="p33" href="#p33" data-label="33" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*33</a>conducting the water to his saw-mill.
