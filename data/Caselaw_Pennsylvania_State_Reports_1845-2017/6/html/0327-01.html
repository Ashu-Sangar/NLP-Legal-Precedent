      <a id="p328" href="#p328" data-label="328" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*328</a>The^ circumstances, under which the note was given, appeared from the evidence at the trial to be, substantially, the following : In 1841, William Edgar took a lease of a farm from one Daniel McHenry, for four years, from 1st of April, 1842, at $85 a year. After moving on the farm, and living on it a year, or eight or nine months, Edgar rented it for the remainder of his term to one Conner, and left it. After Conner had been on the farm for two or three weeks, Edgar induced him to throw up his lease. After this was done, Edgar told Conner that he was going to sell the remainder of his term, under his lease from McHenry, to Hiram R. Kline, <em>and that lie would sldn him; </em>that there were judgments to the amount of several hundred dollars entered up against the farm, and that he believed it would be sold; and that he had paid McHenry two years’ rent in advance, and that he would have his money out of it somehow. On the 20th of September, 1848, an article of agreement between William Edgar and Hiram R. Kline, under which Edgar leased the farm for the remainder of his term to Kline, was drawn and executed. After the lease was executed and delivered to the scrivener, who drew it up and was to hold it, Edgar said to Kline, “ <em>If you will give me your notes and five dollars more than the article calls for, I will talee it in grain, at Kline's mill, at the Bloom prices ;” </em>which proposition Kline, after some hesitation, agreed to accept. The notes, of which the one in suit was one, were then drawn up and signed by Kline. The notes were given for the consideration of the article. When Klino had signed the notes, he held them up in his hand, and said, <em>“ </em>Edgar, <em>I am to hold the land for three crops, will you bade me in it.” JEdgar answered that he would. </em>Edgar then took up the article and destroyed it; but whether with the assent of Kline, did not appear. Under the article, Kline was to hold the land for the remainder of the term. Edgar said he had paid McHenry, or nearly so, for the whole four years.'</p>

When Kline informed Edgar that he was dispossessed, he asked him if he would back him on the notes he had given him; to which Edgar replied that he would not.</p>

He was, therefore, to have had possession of the land, under his contract with Edgar, for nearly three years, but was dispossessed in ten months after taking possession. A few days after the note in suit was given by Kline, Edgar handed it to Rickets and Stewart, one of whom presented it to Kline, who said it was a good note, and he would pay it at maturity. There was some contradictory evidence, as to whether Rickets and Stewart took the note in consequence of Kline’s declaration that it was a good note, and would be paid at maturity, or whether this declaration were made after they had taken it. It was admitted on the trial by plaintiff,.that the consideration for which.the note was -given had failed; or that Kline had received no consideration for the note. It also appeared, that, in the spring of 1845, Rickets called at Kline’s mill and demanded of Kline the grain in payment of the note. Kline told him he had not the grain, and would not pay it. It also appeared, that the defence of Kline before the justice was, that he had not received any consideration for the note; that it. was given for rent in advance, and that he was turned out of possession before his term was out. At the trial in the court below, no attempt was made by the' plaintiffs to show that they had paid, or gave value, to Edgar for the note, although notified that they were required to do so.</p>

Chitty says, in his treatise on Bills, <em>‘ </em>In the case of bills payable to: <em>bearer, </em>that if the bearer bring the action, he ought to entitle himself to it on a valuable consideration, and strictly to prove his coming by it <em>bona fide, </em>and in any other case where there is reason to expect that a defence will he attempted. On the want of <em>consideration, </em>the plaintiff should be prepared, on the trial, to prove what he gave for the bill, &amp;c.’ In a note to the <a id="p330" href="#p330" data-label="330" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*330</a>above, it is now held, that there is no difference between a failure and want of consideration, that each may be set up as a defence, not only between the original parties, but also against a holder claiming by endorsement after the note has become due, or taking it with a knowledge of fraud or other equitable circumstances entitling the maker to avail himself of the defence.</p>

Can this mere suggestion prevent the -defendant from proving that he received <em>no consideration </em>for the note, because at the time it was made, or shortly afterwards, he admitted it was a valid note and would be paid at maturity ? There is no doubt, as between Edgar and Kline, the consideration utterly failed. Edgar admitted that he had cheated him, ‘ had skinned him.’ We think that in order to enable Rickets and Stewart to recover, they should prove that they not only took the note in consequence of Kline’s declaration that it was good, and would be paid when due, but that they also p'aid a good or valuable consideration for it to William Edgar, by reason of Kline’s promise or declaration. As they have not shown that they did pay any thing for the note, and as Kline has proved that it was without consideration, we therefore direct the jury to find a verdict for the defendant.”</p>

Such a representation, acted upon <em>Iona fide </em>by the transferrees, would preclude the defendant from any inquiry into the adequacy of the consideration, or the fairness of the original transaction, for it amounts to a relinquishment of any objection he might otherwise have made on these grounds, and it matters not whether the representation proceeded from ignorance, carelessness, or design.

Assuming there was proof of this on the trial below, though the fact seems to have been disputed, its effect was to raise in favour of the assignees a counter equity superior to that residing in the maker of the note, upon the principle that it would be unjust to visit them with a loss occurring because of the negligence or folly of the obligor, there being no default in the assignees; McMullen <em>v. </em>Wenner, <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%2021" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="16 Serg. &amp; Rawle 21">16 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 21</a>.
