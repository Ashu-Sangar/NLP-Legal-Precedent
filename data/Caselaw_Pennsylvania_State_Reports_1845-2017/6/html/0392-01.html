It changed the name, style, and title of the company; permitted the company to alter the height 'of the dhms from four and a half to eight feet from pool to pool below Brownsville; and it authorized the company, when the navigation of any portion of it was completed, to receive such rates of toll <em>per mile, </em>as, at their discretion, might be just and reasonable, subject to the control and regulation of the legislature.</p>
