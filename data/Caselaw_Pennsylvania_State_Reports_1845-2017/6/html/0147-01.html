I asked Mr. Theodore Burr whether he proposed building that bridge; he told me not — that he had enough bridges on hand to attend to. He then mentioned <em>Reuben Melds </em>being a first-rate mechanic in wood, and said he had worked with Burr at the Harrisburg bridge, and that I had better go down and see Mr. Fields, and put in with Fields for building the bridge. This was in the spring of 1816 — I think in the month of May. I went on to Harrisburg; I saw Mr. Fields, and being introduced to him, he came up to Lewisburg the week following. This was before the letting, made to ascertain if materials could be got for building. He returned to Harrisburg. He came up again a few days before the letting, and brought up a <em>plan </em>aind <em>dfaft </em>of the Lewisburg bridge. Theodore Burr advised Fields and me to build on that plan.’ We presented the plan to the Lewisburg Bridge Company, July 8d, 1816, together with our proposals for building the bridge. On the day following, the 4th of July, Mr. Hepburn drew the contract between the Lewisburg Bridge Company, and me and Fields, and on the 7th of July, we commenced excavating the foundation for stone work. The same season, T. Burr came up to Lewisburg, while we were at work; we had got up two piers, and two abutments about <em>half-way. </em>I think in September, or later, Mr. Burr appeared very much pleased with it; said nothing then about the wood work. Mr. Fields came up that fall to commence the wood work. He had finished for Mr. Burr, at Harrisburg. Early the next spring one of the reaches was up, and another part raised on the east side, when Burr came up. He said nothing about his patent-right at that time. I saw him in the fall of the same year, 1817; the bridge was then passable for teams, or perhaps not quite so. The superstructure was up, it was passable, and teams crossed it November 1, 1817. I moved to Lewisburg 1st of April, 1818. Mr. Burr came to my house in April, 1818, or May; he then spoke of his patent-right, and said the Lewisburg Bridge Company ought to give him something, because it was his right of building the bridge — the patent-right was his. I said to Burr, <em>&lt;■ </em>as we had exhibited his plan of a bridge, which you recommended to us, and if you call on the Bridge Company for any thing, they will call on Fields and me.’ He then made reply, <em>‘I’ll not interfere with Melds and you; and as to </em>you, James, <em>I give you a right to build bridges on my patent-right plan.’ </em>For fear I would be disturbed in building the bridge at Delaware, James Patterson gave me his deposition in 1825, to prove the privilege which Burr gave me. I gave the affidavit to Mr. Greenough.</p>

This evidence was offered for the purpose of showing a public user .with Burr’s knowledge and assent, and an abandonment by him of his right. The plaintiff objected to the evidence offered, on the ground that it was irrelevant, and not contained in the notice of special matter. The court sustained the objection and rejected the evidence, which, constituted defendant’s <em>first </em>bill of exception. The defendant then asked leave to file the following special plea “ The defendant pleads that the said Theodore Burr abandoned to the public the use of his alleged invention and discovery, for seven years before the, date of his patent, (April 3, 1817,) that in the years 1812, ’13, '’14, and ’15, he erected bridges,upon the same principle, at Northumberland, and at Harrisburg, and also, previously to these years, in the state of New York; and that therefore his said patent was void and invalid.” The plaintiff objected to the filing of the special plea, because it should have been embraced in the notice of special matter; and because the matter contained therein was irrelevant, and if permitted to be filed, it would evade the rule of court requiring thirty days’ notice. The court (Anthony, P.) said, they were satisfied that the special plea was offered'to be filed, for the purpose of curing an omission in the notice, and to enable the defendant to do, indirectly, that which the court had decided he could not do directly, and therefore refused the permission asked to file the said plea.

The evidence offered was objected to by the plaintiff, Burr, because it was irrelevant, and because it was not in the notice of special matter given by the defendant. The notice of special matter was not more general than the declaration of plaintiff. Had the special matter contained in the notice been a plea, and plaintiff had demurred to it, he would have failed, as he had committed the first error ? How special must the notice be ? To this point he cited <a href="/whart/4/0311-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Whart. 311" data-case-ids="1834976" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0311-01">4 Whart. 311</a>; Evans <em>v. </em>Kramer, and Evans <em>v. </em>Eaton, 1 Penna.

The court should have permitted the defendant to have filed his special plea. This was objected to on the ground that it was designed to supply a deficiency in notice of special matter. Had the objection been that it was to supply a defect in a plea, it would obviously have been error to sustain the objection. Upon principle, then, and common sense, why should not a defect in special matter be cured ? When, through informality, the merits of the cause will be affected, the plaintiff will be permitted to amend his declaration, or statement, and the defendant may alter his plan or defence on or before the trial of the cause. The remedy for the plaintiff and defendant is, under the act, equal and co-extensive; Act of March 21, 1806. Suppose no plea but payment pleaded; surely defendant might add another: as, for instance, that Burr, the plaintiff, was not the inventoi’, the right never having been tried, as he contended. Then if the defendant pleaded payment, with leave to give the special matter in evidence, and neglected to give any notice of special matter, surely he can put in a special plea setting out his defence. Plaintiff may amend without notice — why not defendant?

The action was brought on-a bond, or rather an agreement, to pay the plaintiff a round sum if he should succeed in establishing the legal validity of Theodore Burr’s patent for the plan of a bridge; in recompense of which, the defendant was to become joint owner of it with the plaintiff who had derived the right from the patentee. The defendant brought an action in the plaintiff’s name for an invasion of it against the Danville Bridge Company, and obtained a verdict and judgment by compromise, which the court properly ruled to be presumptive evidence of the originality of the invention, and left to the jury the question of abandonment raised by evidence that the patentee had given a parol license to two persons to build bridges on his plan before his patent was actually taken out. It is argued that he ought to have ruled it to be an abandonment, as a conclusion of law. But though it is true that an invention or discovery, like every- other right, may be irrevocably surrendered or dedicated to public use, what ground was there for such a conclusion in this case ? In Pennock <em>v. </em>Dialogue, 2 Peters, 16, it was said that the words in the act of Congress, “ not known or used before the application,” mean not known or used by the public at large; but the use of an invention by special permission of the patentee, is not a use of it by the public. 'If the author of an invention were bound to patent it before its properties had been published and established by actual use, a great part of his time might expire before -he could make it profitable to himself. In this very instance, it appears that the patentee proposed his invention severally to the Harrisburg and to the Northumberland Bridge Companies; by each of whom it was rejected in favour of a very inferior one, because the other had not then been tested by practice. A right abandoned to the public, <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>doubtless, cannot be resumed; but a license restrained to individuals, is not an abandonment. Except the verdict in the case of the Lewisburg bridge, the other parts of the evidence raised questions rather of fact than of law ; but that verdict, being a general one, and determining no more than that the action was barred by the matter contained in some one of the pleas — the statute of limitations among the rest — could not be said with any certainty to disaffirm the validity of the patent. This appears to be the substance of the case, and we find no error in it.</p>
