      <em>June </em>30. These were two actions of debt, the first against the sureties of the prothonotary of the Common Pleas of York, and the other against the sureties of the clerk of the Orphans’ Court, register and recorder of Monroe, to recover the amount of taxes on writs levied by tbe act of 1830, and received by the respective officers while in office. The condition of the bond of the prothonotary was, that if he should faithfully execute the additional duties of the said office, prescribed by the act of 1830, &amp;e., and should-pay over all taxes received under said act, and in all other particulars, conform to said act, then, &amp;c. To this the plea was the statute of limitations. The bond was dated in 1830, and the suit was brought in 1845. <em>But when the </em>moneys were received did not appear from the paper hook. The act of 1808, which is incorporated in the act of 1830, limits the action against the sureties to five years from the date of the recognisance. The court (Eldred, P. J.) gave judgment <em>fro forma </em>for the defendants.</p>

Because all official bonds are taken in the name, of the Commonwealth, and all suits brought upon them must be brought in the name of the Commonwealth. 2.

    <p id="b138-5" data-blocks='[["BL_138.7",138,[320,922,1184,1167]]]'>The act of 6th April, 1830, (Dunlop’s Digest, 439,) is the first act ever passed taxing proceedings in courts. The 9th section requires security to be given by the several officers, “in one-third of the amount fixed by law for sheriffs’ bonds,” by the act of 28th March, 1803 ; and directs that “ the effect, rights and remedies of said bond shall be governed by the provisions of said act of 1803.” The act of 1803, (Dunlop, 170,) limits the liability of the sureties to be sued, <em>to five years </em>after the date of the bond. The defendants, are sureties; the bond is dated in 1830, and not sued until 1846. The case of the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>McKeehan, 3 Barr, 151, does not rule this case, although on an official bond, the defence was put specially on the act of 1798, which speaks of a “ person or persons,” and which, according to the case of The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Baldwin, in <a href="/watts/1/0054-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="1 Watts 54" data-case-ids="1838036" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0054-01">1 Watts, 54</a>, would not bar the Commonwealth. But the act of 1803 expressly bars the <em>Commonwealth </em>or any individual in maintaining a suit against a surety after five years. In the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>McKeehan, the acts of 183.0 and 1803 were not relied on or referred to, probably because they are not classed in our Digests among the acts of limitation; but the act of 1803 is as much an act of limitation as the act of 1798. The ease before the court falls within the exception mentioned in the opinion of the court in McKeehan’s case, where they say that the Commonwealth is not barred, “ unless expressly named.” Here the Commonwealth is expressly named, and the case is consequently clear of difficulty.</p>

The principle deducible from all the cases, English and American, is, that the. legislature shall not' be taken to have postponed the public right to that of an individual, unless, such an intent be manifested by express words or irresistible implication, and this principle is peculiarly applicable to a plea of the statute <a id="p140" href="#p140" data-label="140" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*140</a>of limitations, interposed to bar a public claim. I am not aware of any judicial construction of the act of 1803 in reference to this principle. If, however, it be admitted that its clause of limitation would operate to bar a suit by the Commonwealth, it is by no means clear that the legislature intended to engraft this quality upon the act of 1830, by the use of the words, “ effect, rights, and remedies of said bond.” Full operation may be given to these terms by referring them to the object of the bonds contemplated by the act, the rights to be secured thereby, and the peculiar form of remedy afforded by the old act, without making them a conduit for infusing into the late statute a doctrine at least partially destructive of the remedy. When we recollect that this would be introductory of a new feature unknown to the prior and subsequent legislation had in reference to the official bonds of these officers — for it is not to be found either in the act of 1798 or those of 1832 and 1834, relating to the bonds of prothonotaries, clerks' of courts, registers and recorders — and that it is in violation of the longu-ecognised axiom, that the public right cannot be destroyed or compromised by the neglect of the public agent, nothing short of language clearly and explicitly pointing to a legislative intent in conformity with the construction demanded by these defendants, could justify our sanction of it. We look in vain to the act of 1830 for language of this efficacy. To say the very least of the terms there employed, they are uncertain and ambiguous, if not inapt to express a meaning so important in its consequences upon the pecuniary interests of the community, not likely, as has been justly observed, to be jealously watched and enforced by agents uninvigorated by the stimulus of private gain. Nor is it an argument unworthy of consideration that the defence here set up is heard of for the first time, in the course of seventeen years which have elapsed since the enactment of the statute. In McKeehan <em>v. </em>the Commonwealth, 3 Barr, 151, decided at the last term of this court for this district, when the question was raised whether the. limitation contained in the act of 1798 extended to bar the Commonwealth of just such a claim as the present, the act of 1830 was not even dreamed of as affording any such ground of defence. Whether this ivas because it was regarded as inefficacious for such a purpose, or unknown to the bar and the bench as an enactment restrictive of these public actions, it equally proves the act had never presented itself to the mind of the profession as a statute of limitations, and we think, after full consideration, and looking to the grave doubt that attaches upon it in this connection, it would be hazardous so to pro<a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>nounce it. If it be thought right and politic to extend the principle, based on limitation of time against the sovereign- — a subject upon which there is perhaps conflicting opinion — doubtless those upon whom is devolved the power and responsibility of making the law, will so decree it in terms not to be mistaken; but we cannot, in a doubtful case, when construing an obscurely worded act of Assembly, little, if at all expressive of such a legislative will, undertake to determine such to be the'law of Pennsylvania.</p>
