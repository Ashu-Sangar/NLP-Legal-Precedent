No execution was issued on the judgment for more than six months thereafter. On this docket entry, A. brought an action of debt against D., and declared on it as a promise or stipulation. <em>Held, </em>that as the iorm of the docket entry did not bear any resemblance to a recognisance of bail, the action might have been sustained, if the jury, in their special verdict, had found, that the parties were reciprocally bound thereby j but, that as the jury found no more than an offer to be bail for a stay of execution for six months, and that execution did not issue within that period, it did not follow that the offer was accepted by the plaintiff, without which there would be no contract, and, consequently, that the action could not be sustained.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b199-4" data-blocks='[["BL_199.4",199,[171,515,1205,1026]]]'>John Bieber, the plaintiff in the above-stated suit, brought an action against John Dreisbach and Thomas Dreisbach, to August Term, 1843. The defendants, by their attorney, confessed a judgment on the docket, for the sum of $155 67, the amount of the plaintiff’s demand, on the 29th of August, 1843. On the same day on which the confession of judgment was entered, and directly under the entry of the same, was the following docket entry: “And now, to wit, August 29, 1843, defendants offer Isaac L. Beck, as bail for stay of execution for six months.” This entry was signed by Isaac L. Beck, in his own proper handwriting. No execution was issued until after the expiration of six months, the •’ legal stay of execution on the judgment. On the above-stated docket entry, John Bieber brought this action of debt against Isaac L. Beck. The declaration set forth the original judgment obtained by John Bieber against the Dreisbachs, and averred, that Isaac L. Beck became surety to the said John Bieber, for the payment of his said judgment, in order to obtain a stay of execution for the said Dreisbachs, for six months; and that, in consideration thereof, he, the said John Bieber, did delay issuing execution for the space of six months and upwards. The defendant pleaded nonassumpsit, nil debet, and payment, with leave, &amp;c.</p>

To this evidence, the defendant objected; and the court sustained the objection, and sealed a bill of exception. 3</p>

Instead of suing out a <em>scire facias </em>on it, he has sued and declared on it as a promise or stipulation in an action of debt, which might have been sustained had the jury found the parties to have been reciprocally bound. But this species of promise, as was shown in Clark <em>v. </em>Russell, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20216" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="3 Watts 216">3 Watts, 216</a>, is not conditional, but mutual, the consideration of it being executory, and consequently, to make it effective, both parties must be bound. In that case, it was held, that actual forbearance is not enough, unless it were forbearance in pursuance of a mutual agreement, the consideration of it being promise for promise. In this the jury have found no more than an offer to be bail for a stay of execution, and that execution did not issue within the period. But it follows not that the offer was accepted; without which there could be no contract. The execution, for aught that appears, may have been suffered to rest by the mere supineness of the plaintiff, without regard to any particular motive; and if he actually did nothing, or forbore nothing, in consideration of the offer, he ought not to derive any benefit from it. Besides, as nothing is to be taken by inference in a special verdict, it being the business of a jury to find facts, and <a id="p201" href="#p201" data-label="201" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*201</a>not tbe evidence of them, the acceptance of the defendant’s offer, if there was such a fact, ought to have been expressly found. It is to be regretted that a party should lose the benefit of his security by the incompetency of an .officer; but we cannot disregard the most settled and solemn forms of the law to protect him. There is nothing on the bills of exception to evidence.</p>
