Those stations and depots are clearly as necessary and incidental to a railroad as toll-houses and collectors’ offices are to a canal. Without them tbe franchises of tbe company could’ not well be enjoyed at all — tbe engines could not run without regular and certain supplies of water at these stations, nor could tbe financial and other business of tbe company be conducted without tbe offices upon tbe line of the road, and tbe depots, <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>■which are necessary for receiving the engines and protecting them from injury, for collecting and storing the very bulky materials used in working and in repairing the road, and also for receiving passengers and freight. Indeed, .the act of incorporation of the company, of 4th April, 1833, (Pamphlet Laws, 150,) makes these depots and water stations part, of the road in express terms, where, in the proviso of §xi., it is declared that the said railroad shall not, except in deep cuts and fillings, or at points selected for depots or engine and water stations, exceed four rods in width. Under that <em>proviso </em>the company might have selected the ground for its depots, &amp;c., and have erected them thereon, paying damages to the owner of the fee under §xii., and enjoying a mere easement on the land so occupied. That the company preferred purchasing the fee, if it has done so, can make no difference. The land burdened with the easement would not have been liable to assessment for taxation as against the owner of the fee, nor, as we conceive, against the holder of the. easement. Taking it then for the purposes, and as part of the road, why should it be taxed when held by the company, any more than if held by the inferior tenure ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b72-4" data-blocks='[["BL_72.4",72,[352,1335,1183,1120]],["BL_73.1",73,[194,419,1190,1122]]]'>“Whilst, however, it is clear to our minds that water stations and depots of the company are not subject to taxation, we cannot but come to a different conclusion with regard to that portion of the property returned in south-east ward, which is occupied by the company, for the manufacture, construction, and repair of the locomotives, cars, and other machinery used upon the railroad; and that, notwithstanding the case stated admits that it is necessary for the proper transaction of the business of the company. Certainly, it is necessary that locomotives and cars should be manufactured, constructed, and repaired; but the right to do all that is not &lt; necessary or incident to the making and'maintaining of the railroad, and the conveyance of passengers, and the transportation of the mails and of goods, commodities and merchandise thereon.’ The <em>proviso </em>at the end of the second section of the act of incorporation excludes the company from banking privileges, and from any other liberties, privileges, or franchises, but such as are so, as before mentioned, necessary or incident. The legislature certainly never intended to add manufacturing privileges to the great ones already conferred upon this company. If the company may manufacture iron and wood into locomotives and cars for their own use, they may also manufacture rails, &amp;c., and then, as iron and wood and coal are necessary to these processes, the company may purchase iron mines, and forests and coal mines, and may erect furnaces, and forges, and <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>rolling-mills; and thus, under the interpretation of the charter here contended for, subtract a large amount of property from taxation, and become besides a gigantic manufacturing corporation. The legislature never intended that, nor have they granted it. Neither the proA'iso above cited from the second section, nor yet the words of the twelfth section, authorizing the company to ‘ enter upon and occupy land for the erection of its engine and water stations, weigh-scales, or any other purpose necessary or useful in the construction and repairs of said railroad,’ will justify such an interpretation. The letter and the spirit of the act look not beyond the road itself —to construct, govern and keep which in repair, are the particular' functions of the company. The railroad in the legislative view, as well as in the ordinary sense of the words used in the charter, is entirely distinct -from the means of transportation used upon it;-and the right to construct and repair the' road cannot include a right to construct and repair those means of transportation. If these vieAvs are correct, then so much of the property in the south-east ward as is owned and used by the company as a workshop, for the manufacture of its locomotives, &amp;c., is not necessary or incidental to the enjoyment of any of the liberties, privileges, or franchises of the company — is no part of the road itself, and is not necessary or useful in the construction and repairs of the road, and is consequently a proper subject of taxation.</p>

They have been argued together, and involve the construction of a portion of the tax laws of this Commonwealth. The judgment of the court below is predicated on the opinion of this court, in their construction of the act of the 25th of April, 1844, in the case of the Lehigh Navigation Company <em>v. </em>Northampton County, <a href="/watts-serg/8/0334-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 334" data-case-ids="483321" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0334-01">8 Watts &amp; Serg. 334</a>. So far as the cases are parallel, the judgment of the court is right. But there is a wide difference between things appurtenant and convenient to a railroad, and things appurtenant and part of a canal. It is contended, that the act of the 22d of April, 1846, embraces within its provisions, property returned in this case for taxation, which was not included in the act of 1844. The act of 1844 is comprehensive in its terms, and embraces, of real estate, “all houses, lands, lots of ground and ground-rents, mills and manufactories of all kinds, all furnaces, forges, bloomeries and distilleries, sugar-houses, malt-houses, breweries, tan-yards, and ferries.” The first section of the act of the 22d of April, 1846, after enumerating for taxation certain articles of personal property not before taxed, pro<a id="p75" href="#p75" data-label="75" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*75</a>ceeds: “ And upon all property, real or personal, not taxed under existing laws, held, owned, or invested by any person, company or corporation, <em>in trust </em>for the use,- benefit, or advantage of any other person, company, or corporation: excepting, always, such property as shall be held <em>in trust </em>for religious purposes.” The object of the legislature is clear and manifest, that their intention, in this part of the act, was only to include certain <em>trust estates, </em>as they were aware of the opinion of the court in 8 Watts and Serg., before cited. It is only such property belonging to corporations, and is appurtenant and indispensable to its construction and fitting it for use, that can claim to be exempt from taxation. In the case before us, it is not enough that it is a convenient possession, or that it affords facilities in carrying on the business of the company. This valuable and extensive corporation, operating through a large extent of. country, and doing an immense business at many points on the road, must necessarily employ many agents, as well as the occupation of houses and grounds to transact their legitimate business. It would no doubt be desirable and convenient to the company to own extensive warehouses, coal-yards, board-yards, eoalshutes, and extensive machine shops, at many points and places on the road. But these erections and conveniences form no part of the road. They are necessary and indispensable facilities to increase the business on the road, and to enable the company to make profits. We are not to be understood as interfering with the principles settled in the case of the Lehigh Navigation Company against Northampton County. But we are not for carrying exemption from taxation, or immunities to corporations, beyond that case. The judge was right in determining that the water stations and depots of the railroad were, not taxable. We understand depots so exempt from taxation, as the offices, the oil houses and places to hold cars, and such buildings and places as may fairly be deemed necessary and indispensable to the construction of the road. Warehouses, coal-lots, cpal-shutes, machine shops, wood-yards, and such places, form no part of the construction of the road. , They are only indispensable to the profits to be made by the company,-and are legitimate subjects of taxation within the act of 1844. They are not appurtenant to the road, but to the business done upon it. So far, then, as this opinion changes the opinion of the Common Pleas, on the case stated, the judgment is reversed, but no further.</p>
