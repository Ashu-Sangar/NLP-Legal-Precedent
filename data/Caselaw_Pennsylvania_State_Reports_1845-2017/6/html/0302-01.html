On the 4th day of May, 1838, said Robb came to my store in Muncy, and loaned me three hundred and fifty dollars. I gave him as payment for such loan five notes, four of seventy-five dollars each, and one of fifty dollars, payable one year after date, signed by myself, and Joshua Bowman, as security. When Robb told me the amount he could loan me, I went to my desk, and filled up five printed notes as above stated. I went to the barn of said Bowman to get his name to the notes, and we both went to his house. The notes were presented to him and signed by him. There was no person present except Mr. Bowman.

    <p class="summary" id="b304-4" data-blocks='[["BL_304.4",304,[342,438,1178,681]]]'>“ This action is founded on two promissory notes, signed by Orrin Forsyth and Joshua Bowman, and sealed with only one seal. Forsyth was sued with Bowman, but was not served with the process, and does not appear. The issue is between Robb and Bowman. The defence is that the seal which appears on the paper was the seal of Forsyth, and not of Bowman, and that the plaintiff has therefore joined him improperly with Forsyth in the suit, has improperly declared against him as for a specialty, and moreover is barred by the statute of limitations, the debt being as to Bowman a simple contract debt. The question is, did Bowman adopt the seal as his seal ? This is a question for the jury. It is not denied that several persons may adopt one seal, and make it the seal of each of themselves, and so undoubtedly are the authorities ; but it is said there is no evidence here of such adoption by Bowman.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b304-5" data-blocks='[["BL_304.5",304,[333,1123,1185,1116]]]'>“ In deciding this controversy the jury should have regard to the reasonable presumptions that arise out of the transaction itself. The notes are joint on their face, and contain the words ‘ Witness our hands and seals.’ It has been said in the argument, on the authority of Taylor <em>v. </em>Glaser, <a href="/serg-rawl/2/0502-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Serg. &amp; Rawle 502" data-case-ids="1798257" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/2/0502-01">2 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 502</a>, that these words afford no presumption in aid of a seal. Undoubtedly they do not supply a seal. ' An instrument in Avhich they occur is not a specialty, unless there be a seal, and on the other hand an instrument to which a seal has been affixed is a specialty, though these words be not used in the body of it. But when the words are used by two parties, in their joint note, and they write their names opposite one seal, what do they import ? In such case they may be referred to, as some ground for presuming, that both of the signers of the instrument intended the one seal to bind them. In the case of Talbot and Hodson, 7 Taunt. 251, Ch. J. Gibbs used this language: ‘ I considered that the circumstance that the defendant had written her name opposite to the seal on an instrument, <em>hearing: on its face a declaration that it was sealed with her seal, </em>was some evidence to go to the jury of a sealing and delivery by her.’ So we say in the case before us. Bowman having written his name opposite, a seal, on an instrument, bearing on its face a declaration that it was sealed by him, the fact is in its nature evidence to go to the jury, for what it is worth.</p>

      <em>“ </em>There are other circumstances worthy of attention, as affording, in some degree, a presumption that the one seal belongs to both parties.

He drew the note and signed it at his desk, the seal being made, or, more strictly speaking, the place of the seal being marked; and then he went and found Bowman, who wrote his name opposite the flourish, which marks the place of the seal. Was there any thing unusual in this ? Instruments are generally sealed before they are signed. The scrivener commonly puts on the seal of a deed before the grantor signs his name; but the adoption of the seal by the grantor is inferred from his signing over against it. Either Forsyth or Bowman had to make the place of the seal, and it was much better that the one who did it should do it before the other signed, than after. But when Forsyth brought the notes back to Robb, he remarked that there ought to have been two seals, and. Forsyth replied that they would be paid before six years elapsed, and seals were not material, &amp;c. ;</p>

Or if the jury should think there was, -there certainly was nothing in it to show that Bowman did not-consider-it as his seal. As to the .accuracy of Forsyth’s recollection, after the time that has elapsed, and the credit that, is due-to him, swearing as he does to extricate- his surety from a debt, from which he has himself escaped under cover of the bankrupt -law and Bowman’s release, the jury must judge, and make such allowances as they think proper.
