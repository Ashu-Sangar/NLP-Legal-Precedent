      <em>Sept. </em>29. This suit originated before a justice of the peace, and was brought by George W. Addison against Robert Hampson, to recover a claim of $10, which he alleged was due and owing to him by the defendant. Against a recovery by the plaintiff, the defendant interposed a claim of $15, which he alleged the plaintiff was indebted to him on book account.</p>

From this award the defendant appealed, and on a trial of the case in court, obtained a verdict. A rule was thereupon granted by the court, at the instance of th-e plaintiff, to show cause why the judgment on the verdict should not be entered without costs. After argument, the court discharged the rule, and entered judgment for the defendant for costs; and this was assigned for error here, by the plaintiff.</p>
