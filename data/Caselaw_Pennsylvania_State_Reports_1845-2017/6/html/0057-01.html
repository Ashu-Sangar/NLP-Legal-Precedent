Then as recourse on the contract of endorsement had been jmecluded by the statute of limitations, and as there was no covenant in the articles on which the plaintiff could recover against Medler, in an action at law, there was no ground on which he could, in equity, be subrogated to the rights of the bank against Medler.</p>
