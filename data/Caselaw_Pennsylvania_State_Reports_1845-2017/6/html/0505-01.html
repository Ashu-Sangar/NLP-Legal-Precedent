The pension was not subject to her debts, and was, by the act of Congress, the exclusive property of the children of the pensioner: Pamph. Laws of 1840, p. 25. It was not assets of the estate in the hands of the administrator; it was received by him for the rise of the children of Colonel Hubley, and received as trustee for that special purpose; it was wrong to bring it into the administration account. This court decided, in the case of Aston’s Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wheat.%20229" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="5 Wheat. 229">5 Wheat, 229</a>, where a testator authorized and directed his executors and the survivors of them, to lay out a certain tract of land into lots, and to sell and dispose of the same, and gave the proceeds to certain nephews and nieces, who were his residuary legatees, to be equally divided between them; and the executors sold the lots and received the <em>proceeds; </em>that these proceeds were received as trustees, not as executors, and therefore ought not to be brought into the administration account. And in the trustees of Jacobs <em>v. </em>Bull, <a href="/watts/1/0370-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Watts 370" data-case-ids="1838025" data-case-paths="/watts/1/0370-01">1 Watts, 370</a>, the executors were held accountable as trustees, although named in the will as executors.</p>

Congress has excluded all creditors. From the moment Watson received the pension in this case, he was a trustee for the children of Hubley; to them he is bound to account. He received for their special use and benefit, and for no other use or purpose whatever ; and it should not have been charged against Watson in his administration account. This disposes of the whole case.</p>
