      <em>June </em>30. Replevin for grain. On the 2d of March, 1843, judgment was entered against Crosson, and on the same day a <em>fi. fa. </em>issued, which was levied on the defendant’s land. On the' 6th, Crosson demised the land levied on to James, for two years, from the 1st of April, at an annual rent, payable in advance, and received the rent for the first year. In September the tenant sowed the crop, and on the 9th of October the sheriff sold the land to Boas under the execution on the judgment against Crosson. Boas conveyed to the plaintiff in the following December, and James left the premises, under a notice, on the 1st of April, 1844. In the following summer he entered, cut, and carried away the grain, for which this replevin was brought.</p>

But it is well settled that the growing crop of a debtor pass.es' by a conveyance of his land, whether executed by himself or the sheriff. A tenant, therefore, has a right to enter for the way-growing crop only where he had an indefeasible right to sow it. But though a. judgment-creditor has not a present estate in the land, he has an interest in it which may presently he turned into one; and a lessee of it, knowing that fact, and taking his chance of the event, is supposed to have framed his contract so as to meet it. Had he retained the rent, in this instance,, till the end of the year, his eviction by lawful title would have suspended it; and though he would have lost the crop, he would have lost no more than his labour in the growing of it. Even that might have been saved by a covenant for quiet enjoyment. But, paying the rent in- advance, he parted with his security, and must bear the consequences.</p>
