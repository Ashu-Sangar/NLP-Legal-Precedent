In this instance the defendant’s inquiry led him to the fact that the witness resided at a place within the jurisdiction of the court, the name of which he had forgotten, and that it was within the one or the other of two counties named to Mm. Ho was consequently bound to seek him there. But as he took no step to procure his attendance, except to take out a subpoena, which he did not attempt to serve, he was chargeable with negligence, and the secondary evidence was properly excluded.</p>
