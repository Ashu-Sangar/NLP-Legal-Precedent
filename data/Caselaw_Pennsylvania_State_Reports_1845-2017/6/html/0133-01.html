      <em>June </em>29. The defendant in this action was the drawee’ of an order for the payment of money which was claimed by Finney as assignee of Richards, the former holder, and by Lescure as his bankrupt assignee. The action was an amicable one, to try whether the assignment to Finney was a fraud on the bankrupt law. The evidence given in. the cause was considered as a special verdict, and upon that judgment was given below in favor of Finney. The material facts were, that Richards, being the holder of an order on McAllister, on which there remained a balance of $433 50, assigned it," on the 7th June, 1842, to Finney, who was a creditor. The evidence showed that this was voluntary on the part of Richards, there having been no coercion or threat of suit used by Finney, who had merely presented his account to Richards. At tMs time Richards was a stone-mason, and had been engaged in the lumbering business, and the assigned order constituted all his property of any value, excepting a bridle, saddle, and gun. On the 18th June he swore' to his petition in bankruptcy, stating his debts to be upwards, of $1200, and his property to consist of five worthless claims. In his examination he stated he did not know <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>that at the time of the assignment he intended to apply for the benefit of the bankrupt law: but that he was so much in debt, he knew he could not pay, and he formed his determination to apply some days before the date of his petition, in the event of any creditor pressing him.</p>

    <p id="b135-5" data-blocks='[["BL_135.8",135,[164,961,1179,971]]]'>In this opinion the court were undoubtedly in error. If a person altogether and irretrievably insolvent, and himself conversant with the fact at the time, could lawfully transfer all the property, of any value, which he possessed, to one of his creditors in preference to the rest, a few days before his application for bankruptcy, the bankrupt act would be useless and of no value whatever, except to give colour of law to the very preferences it was designed to prevent. The intent and operation of that law was to apportion and distribute the effects of the bankrupt among his creditors equally, and to break up just such preferences as was given in this case. If the bankrupt had, by any act done <em>bona fide, </em>two months before filing his petition in bankruptcy, preferred a creditor without knowing he was insolvent; such act would have been valid, unless the nature of the act was such as to wear upon its face the unequivocal marks of a design to evade the provisions of the bankrupt act, and which necessarily implied and indicated a belief that he was bankrupt or insolvent, in the usual sense of the words: such as the voluntary transfer of his whole estate to a creditor, thus depriving himself of the means of continuing his business, and making no effort for the benefit of his general creditors.</p>

It may be added, however, that he was, in addition to his trade, engaged in the lumbering business.
