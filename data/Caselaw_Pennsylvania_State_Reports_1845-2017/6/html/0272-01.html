Bailey stated that the resolution was in writing, and unanimously agreed to by the board; although it did not appear to have been entered on the minute-book of the bank. The resolution was not attested by the corporate seal; tho meeting at which it vas passed, was held on the same day upon which the judgment was entered. No objection was ever made at any subsequent period, on the part of the bank, or any one interested therein, to the justice of the indemnity; nor any attempt, at any time, to open or set aside the judgment. It appeared, also, that ata meeting of another board of directors, held in 1843, still further security was given to the several persons named in the preamble to the confession of judgment, and on the same account.</p>

The court below had created it, and set aside the execution on it, at the instance of subsequent creditors, but the money was decreed in this court to the plaintiff. The difference between that case and this is, that the subject in contest was the produce of chattels in the one instance, and that it is the produce of land- in the other; but the foundation of the lien in each was an actual, but irregular judgment, put upon the records of the court without authority.
