At that early day, the practice in relation to transferring the interests of warrantees to warrants for land, was quite different from what it is, at the present day. .No one thought of placing it on record, and frequently warrants were treated as personal property; and'very little form or ceremony was used in passing the interest from one to another. But if the jury should believe, that Michael Bachman was the real owner of the warrant, and that a 'survey had in fact been made on it, his so grossly neglecting to return the survey may have lost him all claim on the land. It certainly would be lost to him, ,as against one who entered upon 'the land with the intention of appropriating it to his own use, and had marked out and designated the boundaries of his claim,- or it would be lost against one who had taken out a warrant and had a survey thereon, returned to the office.

In travelling in the woods looking for land at that day, the girdling of a few trees, or the cutting of a few boughs for a hunter’s cabin, was designated as an improvement.

But if tbe warrant was precisely descriptive of tbe land surveyed, tbe law imposed a duty on its owner, to have it returned • into tbe land-office in a reasonable time. Tbe land-offices of tbe province closed on tbe 4th of July, 1776, and so remained until tbe 9th of April, 1781, when tbe legislature re-established them under tbe Commonwealth; 2 Smith’s Laws, 192.

Tbe time was extended by subsequent acts of tbe legislature. Tbe Commonwealth was indulgent to tbe owners of old office rights, and continued that indulgence until some settler entered, or a new warrant was obtained for tbe land. Tbe act of 1786 defined an improvement to be an actual resident settlement, with a manifest intention of making it a place of abode, and tbe means of supporting a family, continued from time to time.</p>

Tbe Gissler survey has never been returned; and nothing could protect tbe title of tbe plaintiffs under this warrant and survey, but an actual and continued occupation and possession of tbe land before any new right was commenced or acquired.
