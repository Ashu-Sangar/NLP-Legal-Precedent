      <em>July </em>8. William Donaldson and Anna Maria, his wife, against the West Branch Bank and the Bank of Pennsylvania. This was an issue directed by the Court of Common Pleas of Union county; and the question to be settled under it was, 'whether the legacy claimed by the plaintiff, under the will of John Cowden, were paid, or whether the executor, John H. Cowden, had been guilty of a <em>devastavit, </em>to which <em>William Donaldson, </em>now seeking to recover the legacy, was a party. The facts of the case are these:</p>

In one year after his death, if the legacy remained unpaid, it was to he on interest. After the several specific bequests in his will to his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, he gave and bequeathed to his son, John H. Cowden, all the remainder of his estate, real, personal, and mixed: he to pay all the testator’s debts, Ms daughter Elizabeth, and all his other bequests; and appointed <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>Mm his executor. John H. Cowden became largely indebted. Judgments were obtained against him by his creditors ; and the real estate, which he took under the will of his father, situated in Union, Lycoming, and Northumberland counties, was taken in execution by-process issued on these judgments, and sold for an - amount exceeding- $50,000. The property did not sell for enough to pay all the judgments 'and mortgages given by John IT. Cowden to his creditors; but for more than sufficient to pay the creditors of John Cowden, the testator, and the legatees named in his will, whose legacies were charged on the land, of which, the legacy of Anna Maria Donaldson was- one.</p>

The defendants, who were the creditors of John H. Cowden, the residuary devisee, resisted the payment of this legacy; n6t because the legacy of $30.00, given to her, -was not a lien on the, lands sold, and entitled to payment on that account in preference to their claims against John H. Cowden; but’they alleged a <em>devastavit of the estate of John </em>Cowden, deceased, by thfe executor; and to which, they say, Wil-. liam Donaldson was a party, and' colluded with the executor- when he had the means of satisfaction of his wife’s legacy-in'his own hands, and after he knew of the insolvency of John H. Cowden. The defendants showed, that William Donaldson was indebted to John Cowden, at his death, in the sum of $1000, for which he had given his note on the 8th of July, 1831, payable three days after' date; and- as a member of the firm of Colt &amp; Donaldson,- a further -sum of $2000, for $1000 of which, he gave their note, dated the 8th of July, 1831, and payable three days after date and for the remaining $1000, gave their note on the 6th of September, 1836, payable on demand. At the death of John Cowden, when these notes came into the hands of John H. Cowdén, the executor, as residuary legatee, the whole of the principal was due, and interest on the principal for several- years; and Donaldson, at that time, owed the estate of John Cowden more than the amount of his wife’s legacy, which was a subject of set-off against the legacy. John Cowden died on the, 12th of-January,,1837. ■ No .settlement was ever made of this claim- against Donaldson, or against Colt &amp; Donaldson, until the 22d of November, 1842. ' The defendants showed, that the creditors of John H. Co.wden had entered their claims of record, so as to create a lien on his real estate to a very large amount, and greatly beyond what his real estate afterwards <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>sold for at sheriff’s sale. These liens were entered of record, during the spring, summer, and fall of 1841. They proved by William Forsyth, that he and Donaldson talked about the larger 'liens that were entered against John II. Cowden, in January, 1842. They showed by the records, that the real estate of John H. Cowden, in Northumberland county, was sold by the sheriff on the 18th of July, 1842; that his real estate in Lycoming county had been put up for sale, and bid off in August, 1842. Objections to the confirmation of this sale were made, and, by consent, it was set aside, and afterwards sold in 1843. John II. Cowden made his application for the benefit of the bankrupt act, on the 23d of December, 1842, and was subsequently discharged. Subsequently to the sale of his real estate in Northumberland county, and to the attempted sale in Lycoming county, arid previously to the application of John H. Cowden for the benefit of the bankrupt act, to wit, on the 23d of November, 1842, he settled with William Donaldson, and took in payment from Donaldson for his individual note of $1000, which with the interest then due upon it amounted to about $1625, sixty-five shares of stock of the West Bank, at par — $25 for each share. At the same time, William Colt, the partner of Donaldson, settled the two notes of Colt &amp; Donaldson, which, at that time, with their interest, amounted to $280T. In payment for these, John H. Cowden took from Wm. Colt his note, with Mr. Moore as security, for $1200, payable to Mr. Thompson in one year thereafter, with interest, to pay, as Mr. Cowden states, a debt which he owed Mr. Thompson, of that amount; and for the balance, he took from Mr. Colt $1600, in what has been denominated post-notes of the Tidewater Canal Company. The defendants alleged that these transactions were fraudulent between Cowden and Donaldson; and that the purchase of these stocks and notes was a devise to favour Donaldson, who could have set off his wife’s legacy against his indebtedness to the estate of John Cowden, deceased, on these notes. The defendants, in addition to the proof of the manner in which John II. Cowden was involved at the time, and of his application, after the settlement of these notes, for the benefit of the bankrupt act, gave in evidence the situation and estimated value of the stock of the West Branch Bank, at the time of the transfer, and also of the value of the Tidewater Canal Company’s notes; or, at least, gave testimony which was submitted to the jury,- from which they were to determine whether they were depreciated or not.</p>

In April, 1842, John H. Cowden transferred several judgments of his deceased father’s estate in Columbia county, amounting to $735, to William Donaldson, for Swatara railroad stock, for which he then subscribed to the company. This stock was also depreciated. . William Donaldson, at the time of the transfer, was agent for the company. The stock purchased did not belong to Donaldson, but to the company; and the subscription by Cowden was an original subscription to the, company for fourteen shares of stock, at $50 a share, and amounting to $700, and for which he received a certificate from the company.</p>
