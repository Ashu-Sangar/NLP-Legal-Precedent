In August, 1840, Hoover, the defendant’s intestate, sealed articles by which he agreed to convey two tracts of land, one <em>containing one hundred and twenty acres, and the other fifteen acres, he the same more or less, </em>to Hershey, in consideration of $85 <em>per acre, neat measure, for each and every acre. </em>Hoover dying, his administrator, in the "same year, presented a petition to the Orphans’ Court for leave to perform the coüftracfc, which was granted, a deed made and the purchase-money paid and distributed among the heirs. In these proceedings the quantity of the land and the terms of sale followed the articles. The deed was not upon the paper book, but was stated by counsel to have described the land by courses and distances, and to have named a gross sum as the consideration.</p>

I told them I thought they had better have it, surveyed, because it was by the acre. Hooyer said he thought it would hold out, that a surveyor had bought the tract, and he did not think he would cheat himself. They said I should write it one hundred and twenty acres, more or less. They were both satisfied.”</p>

After some conversation about a dam, Hoover then said <em>he thought it would not hold out, </em>that the purchasers might have it surveyed, but he would not sell it for less than one hundred and thirty-five acres. “We might survey it after we purchased it.”</p>

This view is also an answer to the objection that the defendant receiving the money as administrator under the decree, and having paid it away, is not personally answerable. The decree only authorized a receipt of the value of the land actually conveyed at the agreed price per acre ; any thing received beyond that was not affected by the proceedings, and, if paid under a mistake of facts, was liable to be reclaimed: Grier <em>v. </em>Huston, <a href="/serg-rawl/8/0402-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Serg. &amp; Rawle 402" data-case-ids="1809560" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/8/0402-01">8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 402</a>; Ashcom <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 Penna.

Here there was no such deficiency as is required by those eases, nor any representation on which the purchaser could rely.

And the reason for it is a plain one. It would be palpably unjust for a party, who had taken his chance as to the quantity, instead of insisting on a survey at the proper time, to have an allowance for his disappointment. Where the parties do not treat on the basis of actual measurement, they waive it, and agree to give and take the tract as it is estimated. Using the supposed quantity and stipulated price per acre but as data to arrive at the value in gross, they treat, in fact, as if the land were bought and sold in the mass, and for a round sum; and the vendor is answerable, in respect of the quantity only, for <em>mala fides. </em>Such is the principle of Smith <em>v. </em>Evans, <a id="p132" href="#p132" data-label="132" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*132</a><a href="/binn/6/0102-01" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="6 Binn. 102" data-case-ids="1795104" data-case-paths="/binn/6/0102-01">6 Binn. 102</a>.

' The case before us is, if possible, stronger. Not only was there no special stipulation for a survey, but the vendor refused to have one inserted in the articles. The scrivener testified, that when he had written to the part at which the price per acre was mentioned, he inquired whether the tract was to be surveyed, and suggested the propriety of having it done; but that the vendor said he thought it would hold out, as a person who was a surveyor had formerly bought it, and he did not think he would cheat himself; upon which the parties told him to put the quantity at one hundred and twenty acres, more or less. Now, though this express waiver is made out by parol evidence, which would not be received, were it wanted to control the interpretation of the articles, yet the right of survey, existing, as we have seen it does, independent of special provision, might be rebutted by it on a bill for specific performance. But the waiver of it, implied from the acceptance of a conveyance, is just as strong and entirely conclusive. It certainly does not weaken the effect of it, that the conveyance was made in pursuance of a decree of specific performance in the Orphans’ Court. In the absence of fraudulent misrepresentation, the maxim is, as in every other case, <em>caveat emptor.</em>

Even if it had not, he was not bound to disclose it. In Hepburn <em>v. </em>Dunlop, <a href="/us/14/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="1 Wheat. 179" data-case-ids="532374" data-case-paths="/us/14/0179-01">1 Wheat. 179</a>, 1 Cond.

Rep. 791, it was held that a vendee of merchandise is not bound to disclose his private information of the state of the market which would affect the price of the article, it being enough that he <em>says </em>nothing tending to impose on the vendor. A severer rule of morality would be impracticable in a commercial community. In the case under consideration, the vendor would not have been at liberty to suppress any material <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>fact distinctly known to Mm; but the only fact he asserted, that the land had been purchased at the reputed quantity by a surveyor, was not attempted to be disproved. The description of the quantity in the title deeds spoke for the rest. His doubts, if he entertained any at the time of the bargain, were matters of opinion in which he might be mistaken, and with which the vendee, to .whom the same sources of information were open, and whose business it was to decide for himself, had nothing to do. According to the contract, as it was executed, each party was to take Ms chance of a doubtful event, and each is bound to abide by it.</p>
