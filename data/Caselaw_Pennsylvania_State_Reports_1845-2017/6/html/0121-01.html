      <em>June </em>28. Trespass against the sheriff for seizing the property of the defendant in error, under an execution against’Johnson. It appeared on the trial that Johnson was a marble mason and lessee of a lot, on which he had erected a shop which he had the privilege of removing, and in which he carried on his trade. In November, 1842, he was the owner of a quantity of marble and 'worked stone lying on this lot and another one. On the 18th he entered into an agreement with Lesley, who was then one of his workmen, and to whom it was alleged a sum of money was due for wages, by which he sold his stock of marble, and received a note for the balance remaining due after deducting the wages due to Lesley. At the same time, they sigued a distinct agreement, by which Lesley agreed to employ two apprentices of Johnson until the next spring, at wages to be determined by that time; it being agreed if there was enough work to employ them, Johnson should receive three dollars per week, and if not, then, not less than two; Johnson finding the apprentices in hoarding and' clothing. Lesley also agreed to pay a proportionate part of the ground-rent for the lot, and a reasonable rent for the shop, fences, &amp;c., until he removed the stock. It was proved that, after this assignment, possession was given to Lesley, and that Johnson rarely went to the lot, unless requested by Lesley, to assist him in making sales.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b121-8" data-blocks='[["BL_121.9",121,[194,2090,1178,387]]]'>At the time of the assignment, Johnson was much indebted, but had other property besides that conveyed to Lesley, all of which was sold by the sheriff. On the 8th November, 1842, a judgment was confessed by him, and this property sold under a <em>fi. fa., </em>issued in January, 1843. The books of Jobusou and the accounts which were settled between himself and Lesley, were not produced, and there was evidence that at that time Lesley was a man without property.</p>

Second, After the evidence was- closed, the plaintiff amended his <em>narr., </em>by increasing the damages from $700 to $2000, the defendant objecting and asking a continuance on payment of costs by plaintiff. The defendant asked instructions: First, That the agreement stipulating for an advantage to Johnson was entirely void as to his creditors. Second, That if a partial possession-was retained by the assignor, or his apprentices, it was void.</p>

The principles of law involved in the case were well stated, and the facts, all depending on, parol evidence, were left to the-jury, but with the intimation of an opinion unfavourable to the transaction. In Twine’s case, the distinction between actual and legal fraud was faintly sketched; if, indeed, it'was attempted; but it has often since been held, that an assignment is made fraudulent by the reserva- ' tion of an advantage to the debtor, so fixed that his creditors cannot wrest it from him; and on this ground the judge'was required to charge that the binding of the debtor’s apprentices to his assignee was such a reservation. The contract, however, was collateral to the assignment; and the labour of the apprentices could not have been reached by execution, even if no contract had been made; To subject it to payment of debts, would-be inconsistent with the contract of apprenticeship. The apprentice works under his master's direction; and the produce of his labour g'oes along with his master's earnings to accumulate property, which, of course, the creditors may seize and sell. But, they were, in this instance, put actually in a more advantageous position by the transaction; for the wages reserved might be seized by an attachment in execution, and made available in payment of their debts, which was not so before. The direction was right, but the verdict was wrong ; and what was the remedy ? Certainly not a writ of error; for it would eventually be as prejudicial to the great ends of justice for this court to correct the errors of the jury, as for the jury to correct its judgments in the last resort. Each has its peculiar province, and will best perform its functions within the precincts of it.</p>
