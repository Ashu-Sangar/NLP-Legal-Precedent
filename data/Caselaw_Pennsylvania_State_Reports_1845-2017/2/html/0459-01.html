Keys is a competent witness. Keys &amp; <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>McCormick were grocers in Baltimore; Keys became insolvent, and was discharged as an insolvent debtor in the state of Maryland. By the insolvent laws of that state, a person there legally discharged, holds after-acquired property from his creditors, unless he obtains it by descent, gift, devise, bequest, or in course of distribution. Pollet <em>v. </em>Parmer, 2 Harr. &amp; Johns. 61. The Maryland insolvent act partakes of the character of a bankrupt law, but is not as favourable to the' debtor as a general bankrupt act. The law was early held in England, that no release could make the bankrupt a witness to his own act of bankruptcy, 2 Strange, 132. A bankrupt who has obtained his certificate, is not a competent witness to prove the debt of the petitioning creditor, 2 H. Bl. 279; nor is a bankrupt a competent witness to increase the divisible fund in an action by his assignees, unless he has obtained his certificate, and released the surplus and proportional allowance; for otherwise his interest is obvious, 2 Starkie, tit. <em>Bankrupt, </em>211.</p>
    <p id="b460-4" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[325,1177,1187,382]]]'>Here the insolvent was a party to the action, and was the only material witness to charge the defendant below -with goods sold to his son. There was no writing on the part of Jacob <em>Bittinger; </em>no assumption by parol proved, by any person but Keys. To affirm this judgment, would be establishing a precedent more injurious to the community than Steel <em>v. </em>Phoenix Insurance Company, which had introduced so much injustice into our courts, supported by the basest of all crimes, wilful and corrupt perjury.</p>
    <p id="b460-5" data-blocks='[["BL_460.5",460,[326,1565,1187,188]]]'>Wolf <em>v. </em>Fink, 1 Barr, 435, settles this case. It is there held that a certified bankrupt who had not a particle of interest in the event of the suit, but who, at the impetration of the writ, was a party to the action, is ilot a competent witness.</p>
    <p id="b460-6" data-blocks='[["BL_460.6",460,[326,1759,1188,236]]]'>In the case before us, I think Keys had an interest in increasing the fund, winch must be settled by his assignee with McCormick his co-partner. We do not think an interest necessary in a case like the present. Every consideration of policy renders Keys, who was a party to the record, an incompetent witness.</p>
    <p id="b460-7" data-blocks='[["BL_460.7",460,[487,2002,982,42]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and a venire de novo awarded.</p>
