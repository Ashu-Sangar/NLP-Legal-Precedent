      <em>March </em>6. — The Mechanics’ and Tradesmen’s Loan Company entered judgment on warrant of attorney, in November, 1837, on which a scire facias was issued, reciting the original judgment and that execution remained to be done, and commanding the sheriff to warn defendant to show cause why plaintiff ought not to have execution. On this, judgment was entered in March, 1842. . Appellants subsequently obtained a judgment, on which the property was sold, and the question was as to the lien of the Loan Company, which the court decided bound the property.</p>
