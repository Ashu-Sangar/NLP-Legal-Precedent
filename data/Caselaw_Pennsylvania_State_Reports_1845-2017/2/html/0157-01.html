      <em>Jan. </em>15,16. — On the 24th February, 1844, appellant filed a petition, stating that in 1833, his younger brother Catchick died in Calcutta, and letters of administration there and in London were then granted to appellant, who also administered in Copenhagen. In 1837, he came to Philadelphia to administer on the estate here, and to attend'to his own family’s interest, under the will of his grandfather, under which his brother derived his estate. As that estate was not ready for his distribution, there being no other assets, he proposed delaying to take out letters of administration until he could receive the funds. That petitioner was entitled to the administration: his brother dying without issue or widow, and leaving a mother and two brothers, one residing in Calcutta. In 1842, he was unexpectedly called to London, and his intended stay of a few weeks prolonged to thirteen months, until October, 1843. That in March preceding, letters of administration on Catchick’s estate were granted to Joseph Cabot, without any necessity, there not yet being any funds to be reached, said Cabot being neither relative, creditor, nor recommended by any such; petitioner not having refused nor being incompetent, and no notice having been given to himself or counsel known as such, and residing here. There were no debts. He prayed a revocation and new letters to himself.</p>

He was informed his share was waiting for distribution by the administrator of his grandfather; the accounts were before auditors; that petitioner abandoned his attendance and refused to inform them who the relatives were ; that he knew not where to notify him, or of his being represented by any counsel; that he acted at the instance of the attorney of a sister of Catchick, by whom he has since been recognised and directed as to appropriation of the money, and also by one holding the share of petitioner in pledge, until which is redeemed he is informed petitioner has no interest. That those represented here have no confidence in petitioner, but apprehend waste if delivered to him, he having forfeited their confidence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b158-3" data-blocks='[["BL_158.4",158,[338,981,1185,871]]]'>Petitioner proved his absence was unexpectedly continued as stated; his administration in Calcutta; powers of attorney to himself and the administrator of his grandfather by various members of his family interested in the said estate; also, of Catchick to the same, to claim his share. That no account had been filed by Cabot. No debts appeared, and no notice was given ; and also the power of attorney by the sister, under which Cabot claimed to act, to Richard and Samuel Oakford, to collect her estate, and that said Oakfords requested said Cabot to act. The appellee proved the deed of mortgage by appellant, part of which appeared to be paid; it recited that no part of appellant’s share had been received by him, whereas, in fact, 015,000 had been. (It is proper here to state this pledge was stated by counsel to have since been redeemed ; the deed was produced, and a motion was made to let it in as further proof, and that it had been executed without perusal by appellant.) The attorney of the mortgagee and of the brother objected to the revocation. It seemed there were three sisters, a mother and two brothers, in the family. The court dismissed the petition.</p>

He may grant them to the widow or relations, or he may join one or more of them with the widow, preferring those of the nearest degree of consanguinity, and males to females; and even these are not entitled, if incompetent, of which the register must judge. Among the causes of incompetency appears to be non-residence in the state, as may be inferred from the provisions of the 27th sect, of the act of 29th March, 1832, that when an administrator has <em>removed </em>from the state, or <em>ceased </em>to have any known place of residence therein, during the period of one year or more, the Orphans’ Court may vacate the letters of administration; and the 27th sect, of the act of the 15lh March, 1832, which prohibits letters testamentary being granted to any person not being an inhabitant <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>of this Commonwealth. Again, it is necessary by the words of the act of tire 15th March, 1832, sect. 27, not only that the applicant should be a relation, or of kin, but he must be entitled to the residue of the personal estate, or a share therein. Notwithstanding, therefore, the preference claimed by the present petitioner, as male over a female, yet had this dispute occurred at the time the letters of administration were taken out, between the two persons claiming to be appointed administrator, the petitioner would have been liable to the objection, first, that he was not then a resident of this slate; and secondly, that he had assigned or pledged his claim to others, and so was not entitled to the residue, or a share therein.</p>
    <p id="b160-3" data-blocks='[["BL_160.4",160,[326,931,1189,528]]]'>But the case is still stronger against him now, when an administrator, liable to no personal objection, has been appointed so far back as March, 1843, and has acted in the administration at the instance of the sister and a transferee, and was appointed at a time when the petitioner had been absent nine months from .the United States, and it seems to have been important to the estate that an administrator should be appointed to prosecute the claim before auditors, and the claim has been so prosecuted, and is now on the point of being distributed. There is nothing in the case, under these circumstances, which, we think, would authorize us to disturb what has been done, and create unnecessarily new embarrassment, delay, or litigation.</p>
