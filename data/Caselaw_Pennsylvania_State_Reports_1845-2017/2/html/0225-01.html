      <em>Feb. </em>5. — The question here was whether the presumption of payment from lapse of time wras rebutted. A judgment was recovered in 1814. The present sci. fa. issued in 1842. The plea was payment. The plaintiff, to rebut the presumption, proved insolvent discharges anterior to the recovery of the judgment; his great poverty since; payment of his funeral expenses by others, &amp;c. The only part of the charge of Stroud, J., which appeared on the record, was the answers to defendant’s points, which, so far as were decided, were :—</p>

The presumption is twofold, first of payment, second of a release. But mere poverty, however great, never has been held sufficient to rebut the first of these. In Whilaume <em>v. </em>Gorges, 1 Camp. 217, there was a trust for creditors of an absconding debtor living under a feigned name, and the belief of his friends of his inability, and this was not considered sufficient. So it is said in Burn <em>v. </em>Freer, 2 Moll. C. R. 171, 176, 178, to prevail in case of rich and poor. Many other cases are to the same effect. <a href="/vt/5/0236-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Vt. 236" data-case-ids="8545536" data-case-paths="/vt/5/0236-01">5 Verm. 236</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%2022" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="14 Serg. &amp; Rawle 22">14 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 22</a>; Lewis <em>v. </em>Van Buskirk, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2075" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 75">7 Watts &amp; Serg. 75</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20213" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Watts 213">2 Watts, 213</a>, 215, 217; <a href="/yeates/1/0343-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Yeates 344" data-case-ids="6774880" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0343-01">1 Yeates, 344</a>; Sailor <em>v. </em>Hertzogg, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Whart.%20298" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="4 Whart. 298">4 Whart. 298</a>, case of a discharged insolvent.</p>

It was the business of the court to interpret it, and for the jury to apply it thus interpreted to the evidence. The material question raised by the assignment of error is, whether the mere poverty or insolvency of the defendant was sufficient to rebut the presumption, from the lapse of twenty years. The cases quoted on the part of the plaintiff in error show that neither the one nor the other can do so, unless it be such as to have created an abiding inability to pay during all the time. A man may be poor or insolvent, and yet contrive to pay a debt in twenty years. Whilaume <em>v. </em>Gorges is much stronger in circumstances of extreme destitution than-the case before us, yet Lord Ellenborough held that the presumption of payment <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>was not rebutted by them. And Fladon <em>v. </em>Winter is consistent with it. A debtor doubtless cannot pay when he has neither the means nor an opportunity to pay; but that was not the case here. The defendant had ample opportunity; and, though poor, the proof is that he was not all along entirely destitute, though he died so. For error, therefore, in directing that insolvency or poverty alone might rebut the presumption, the cause must be sent to another jury.</p>
