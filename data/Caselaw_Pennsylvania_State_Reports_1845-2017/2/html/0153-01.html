      <em>Jan. </em>13, 14, 15. — Andrew Craig brought replevin for three hundred and fifty hogsheads of molasses and twenty-five hogsheads of rum, of the value of $9000. The pleas were non cepit, and property in defendant.</p>

Craig, who on his voir dire stated, that his firm had sold the property to plaintiff, which they had previously purchased from Smith, in payment for which certain notes were to be returned to Smith, which notes were endorsed by the firm <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>to plaintiff. A deed was then read, dated January 9, 1840, assigning a debt due by Smith to witnesses’ firm of $9099 63, and the notes for the same and all other securities, together with the rum and molasses. Also a release by plaintiff dated May 11, 1840, to said firm, of all causes of action by reason of any affirmation or warranty, &amp;c., arising out of said sale, and all defences to any action for the price. Also a general release, January 11, 1844, to the same parties. Defendant objected to the witness as incompetent, from liability on the endorsement of his firm, which was overruled and exception taken. The sale by Smith was in payment of a debt on condition of the delivery of Smith’s notes. To enable witness to do this, he sold to his brother, the plaintiff, who took up Smith’s notes, and made a tender and demand next day after the alleged sale, which being refused, this suit was commenced. The two partners of this witness were subsequently examined without objection. As the rest of the case is not noticed by this court, it is omitted here.</p>

Hubbell, </em>for plaintiff. — On the incompetency of the witness premising the other evidence showed a transaction entirely different in its nature, and this witness, alone relied on to make out the essential facts in the cause, was the real party in interest — the machinery to convert him into a witness being the sale and releases. It is a question of judicial policy whether such an arrangement will be permitted. The late cases have removed the line separating us from the rest of the world, established in Steel <em>v. </em>Phenix; and the reasoning and language in these cases, Post <em>v. </em>Avery, 5 Watts &amp; Serg., &amp;c., is almost the same as in Bell <em>v. </em>Smith, 1 Dow. &amp; Ry. 846 — 854, where a partner was not allowed to be witness in a suit on a policy in the name of the broker, the firm being the parties in interest, though he had released his interest. The succession of assignments, relied on there, appears here, and that case settles the policy of law, and extends far beyond parties to the record.</p>

But in all these there were corroborative circumstances; when a case occurred, so glaring that the court in Post <em>v. </em>Avery vindicated the rule of common sense, followed by Licper <em>v. </em>Pierce, 6 Watts &amp; Serg., and Patterson <em>v. </em>R.eed, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20144" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 144">6 Watts &amp; Serg. 144</a>, <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>and established that an assignment, to make a witness out of a party in interest, could not avail. Such was the case here, for would the plaintiff have purchased a lawsuit without discount for any other purpose ? Is he subject to the imputation of champerty, is the true ground of the rule, and that exists at common law.

Smith having denied the bargain, it became a mere chose, and incapable of sale. He then proceeded to argue the witness was unsustained by other testimony. Though the ground of exception be incorrectly stated, it is immaterial, as the point taken was interest, though it appears in a different way from that taken.</p>
