      <em>Dec. 24. </em>— The plaintiff took judgment by default, in foreign attachment, for the penalty of a bond to the sheriff for appearance, and issued scire facias against the garnishee. The court charged he could not recover, not having ascertained the true amount due on the judgment.</p>

We consider, however, the objection rather in the nature of a plea in abatement, on account of the irregularity in issuing the scire facias, and not as a plea in bar that concludes the plaintiff when his proceedings are made regular.</p>
