      <em>April </em>6. <em>Hirst, </em>being summoned as garnishee in an attachment in execution, pleaded that he had no other moneys of defendants, except the sum of $300 then in his hands, received by -him as attorney at law, under a distribution of the proceeds of a sheriff’s sale of the real estate of a third person. The other pleas are immaterial here. Plaintiff demurred, and the court below gave judgment for defendant.</p>

Considerations of public policy and convenience require, that money in the hands of public officers appointed by law, such as sheriffs, prothonotaries, and other depositaries, should not he stopped whilst in custodia legis. But an attorney at law derives his power entirely from his client, and there seems no more reason for his exemption than that of an attorney in fact or other private agent. Accordingly the authorities are all concurrent on the point; and even in England, where the attorney has a privilege not known here, of being sued in his own court; that privilege gives way where the fund in his hand is to be reached by foreign attachment under the custom of London and other places.</p>
