It was directed by the court to be heard at Nisi Prius.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b421-7" data-blocks='[["BL_421.6",421,[130,910,1190,677]]]'>It appeared that Joseph Fleming, for whom the motion was made, had entered judgments against defendant on the morning of the 9th of April during the hours of business. That the present plaintiffs had, on the same day, filed their warrants of attorney, &amp;c., with the prothonotary at his dwelling-house at eleven o’clock P. M., and of course after the office was <em>closed; </em>they were then endorsed, filed on the 9th, and a similar entry was made on the accompanying bonds. The warrants did not reach the prothonotary’s office until the next morning at eight or nine o’clock. The plaintiffs proved by the deposition of the clerks in the office of this court, the District Court, and the Recorder’s office, that the custom had always prevailed of receiving warrants of attorney at any time before midnight, endorsing them as of that day, and entering the judgment on the day following as of the preceding day.</p>
