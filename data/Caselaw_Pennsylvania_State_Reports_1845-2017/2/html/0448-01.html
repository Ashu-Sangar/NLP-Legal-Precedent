      <em>May </em>14. — This was an action, on an official bond, against a justice of the peace and his surety, in which suggestions of breaches were made, by non-payment of moneys collected by defendant, as justice <a id="p449" href="#p449" data-label="449" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*449</a>of the peace, for the three parties to whose use the action was brought.</p>

Next, a paper signed by the same, stating a suit by one of the present plaintiffs, judgment, execution, and a payment to defendant, by the defendant there, of part of the debt, and by the constable of the balance; this was objected to, and admitted. The next was a certificate by him of accounts put into his hands, and collected by him, as justice of the peace, for the third of the present plaintiffs. The objection to this was, that the claims had never been in suit, and hence the surety was not bound. The surety, defendant, proved these admissions were recently obtained from Kendig when in infirm health; and then proved his resignation of his office was occasioned by a petition for his removal for intemperance, signed by defendant, his surety, and showed a letter to the surety from Kendig, telling him if he did not pay the money collected by him, he would confess judgment.</p>

If the admissions were procured by exciting his displeasure against his surety for his petition, &amp;c., in order to charge the surety, he being insolvent, it was fraudulent. The bond being executed by the surety on Sunday, was void as to him. Neither the docket nor transcripts being produced, nor evidence that they could not be, there was no legal evidence of the claims. The court (Hayes, President) told the jury, the surety was liable for all moneys received in suits before the justice, but not for claims which were to be collected by him without suit, and were so collected; also for the costs. If the money was due, there was no fraud in procuring the admissions of the fact. If the <a id="p450" href="#p450" data-label="450" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*450</a>bond, though signed on Sunday, was not delivered to the prothonotary nor approved by the judge until Monday, and the prothonotary and plaintiffs were not informed of the fact of signing on Sunday, it was valid.

But when was this bond executed? Certainly not until it was delivered, for delivery is of the essence of a deed. It takes effect only from execution on delivery, and, until delivery, it is of no further value than the paper on which it is written. The business began on Saturday, was continued on Sunday, and finally completed on Monday. Nov^, although this exposes the parties to the penalty imposed by the act, yet it does not avoid the bond, for the statute cannot destroy that which had no existence. But, granting that the bond was signed and delivered on Sunday, yet I am by no means satisfied that it is void, as against those who are injured by the official misconduct of the justice. They are innocent parties, and ought not to be affected by the folly or turpitude of the prothonotary and obligors. Such a construction of the act would enable the obligors to take advantage of their own wrong, as against persons who cannot, by any possibility, protect themselves. When both parties are in default, as in the cases ruled, there is a propriety in holding the bond void.</p>

It may be executed on Sunday by design, for the express purpose of shielding themselves from responsibility in case of necessity, and thus enable them to commit a fraud. The intention of the legislature will be obtained by imposing a penalty on the guilty party, without avoiding the bond. General principles must not be so applied as to work injustice to the innocent.</p>

But if it should appear (of which the jury must judge) that no suit was brought, and that the claims were put into his hands to collect as agent merely, it is otherwise. But when put into his hands as a justice, the surety is liable, notwithstanding the money is paid without suit. The money being received in his official capacity, the liability is incurred. The object of requiring bond with surety is to protect the rights of suitors, and that should receive a liberal construction. The principles are plain, as w-ell from the spirit as the letter of the act. The sixth section of the act provides that the bond shall be taken by the prothonotary, in the name of the Commonwealth, with conditions for the faithful application of all moneys that come into his hands, as an officer; and such bond shall be held in trust, for the benefit of all persons who may sustain injury from the justice or alderman in his official capacity.</p>

But the suit is against both justice and surety, and surely the acknowledgment of the justice in writing is prima facie evidence against himself and surety. If there was a combination between the justice and plaintiff, which has been insinuated, but not proved, it was a matter for remark to the jury, but cannot be allowed as a reason for excluding the testimony.</p>
