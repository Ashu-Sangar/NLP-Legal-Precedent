      <em>March </em>4, 5. — Grant, an executor, having filed an account, Seaton, his co-executor, prayed it might be taken as a joint account, to which Grant assented. The only question argued here was, whether Grant was chargeable with a debt due by Seaton to the estate. The testator, <a id="p259" href="#p259" data-label="259" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*259</a>by his will, gave $10,000 to said Seaton; and by a codicil, $5000 additional, which, by a subsequent codicil, he revoked and gave him a house in Chestnut street; he then added, “The said Henry Seaton will be indebted to my estate, at my demise, as will be seen by my ledger; the payment of said debt is to be made, when entirely convenient to him, free from any charge of interest.”</p>

But here Seaton occupied two positions, as executor and as debtor; in the former character no discretion is given; in the latter there are but two constructions of the words “ entirely convenient,” if, in a popular sense, it has no meaning, being but the ordinary phrase of polite demand; if, in a legal sense, the only light in which the court can look at it here, it means ability. A class of cases shows this, in which the promises are to pay when convenient, &amp;e., debts discharged by law; as the stat. of limitations, bankruptcy, &amp;c., in which ability must be shown as a condition precedent. These cases are in Moore, Espinasse, and Tyrwhitt, cited on the other side. But here is an existing debt due, and this voluntary condition should not be so strictly construed. Even then we have shown ability. In Hagin <em>v. </em>Williamson, 5 Monr. 8, the words “not to be hastened,” were held not to alter the liability. The word “ convenient” has been defined to be what is legal, fitting, proper, in <a id="p260" href="#p260" data-label="260" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*260</a>Co.

It must be drawn from his words, and the context of the whole will. Payment of the debt was to be made by Seaton, “when entirely convenient to him, free from any charge of interest.” Had the testator meant that the debt was to come out of the legacy, he would have said so; for it appears from his language in other bequests, that he knew how to speak with precision. It seems he spoke in general terms, because Seaton’s necessities might have made the defalcation of the debt from his legacy much more than inconvenient to him. It is evident that the testator considered him to be a needy man, and meant to relieve him. Had he meant to give him a legacy less the amount of the debt owing to him, what was the use of saying the debt should not bear interest ? A legacy given in payment of a debt bears interest from the death, in order to counter<a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>balance the interest on the debt, and work an immediate extinguishment of it. It clearly seems to have been intended that Seaton should be under no obligation to pay at all. The object was to relieve him from embarrassment, making him the judge of its accomplishment, and leaving the rest to his conscience. Coinciding with the judge on the ground taken by him, it is unnecessary to consider whether it is too late to extricate Mr. Grant from the difficulty into which he brought himself by the perilous step of settling a joint account.</p>
