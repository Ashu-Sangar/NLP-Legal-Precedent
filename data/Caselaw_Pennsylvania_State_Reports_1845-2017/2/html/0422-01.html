The widow brought her actions, as the evidence shows, and stated her cash minutely in her declarations, some before, and some after the seven years succeeding the death of Henry Beeson. Her right to dower was early contested. The case of Beeson <em>v. </em>McNabb, <a href="/watts/2/0106-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Watts 106" data-case-ids="1840176" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0106-01">2 Watts, 106</a>, settled the question, and established her claim. The executors and representatives of Henry Beeson knew that they owed this dower, and they had part of the real estate sold by order of the Orphans’ Court of Fayette county to pay it. In settling their account of the sale, the executor claimed, and the Orphans’ Court allowed him to retain in his hands a sufficient sum to pay the widow and her children at her decease. Payment was made until seven years after the death of Henry Beeson; and although the money is in tire hands of the executor for this special purpose, by the consent of the heirs and the decree of the Orphans’ Court, the plaintiff in error refuses to pay over the dower due the widow — contending that this action cannot be maintained, because the heirs of Henry Beeson were not made parties in this action, and no formal specification of the claim was filed in the Common Pleas, with the prothonotary.</p>

An executor may be a trustee for the creditors as well as heirs.
