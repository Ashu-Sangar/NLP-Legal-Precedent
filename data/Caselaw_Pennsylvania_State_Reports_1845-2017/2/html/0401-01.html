      <em>Jipril </em>28. — Dailey, having recovered a judgment before a justice, filed a transcript in October term, 1842. In September term, 1845, he issued a fi. fa., which the court, on motion, set aside.</p>

The judgment on a scire facias, like the one it is employed to revive, is quod recuperet; and the same presumption of payment from time follows the one as the other. Why, then, should the legislature be thought to have made a difference ? The word revived is inadvertently used for the word <em>alive; </em>and hence the difficulty and the argument. But the case is too clearly within the intent of the act to admit of a doubt; and the execution, therefore, oughtnot to have been set aside.</p>
