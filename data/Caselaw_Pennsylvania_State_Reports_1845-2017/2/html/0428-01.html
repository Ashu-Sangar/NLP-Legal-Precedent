He contended that it was not a case of a lapsed legacy. The construction of the will mainly depends upon the meaning to be attached to the word <em>survivors. </em>In one part of the will, the testator speaks of his “ executor hereafter named and appointed, <em>or the survivor of him.” </em>And he nominates “ <em>Thomas Houston, or the survivor </em>of him,” to be his executor.

Here <em>survivors </em>means, the children, the issue of the deceased brothers and sisters. He knew at the time he made his will, that three of the persons named as legatees therein were dead. <em>Survivors, </em>therefore, could not mean his surviving brother and two sisters; for they were, in fact, the survivors when he made his will; but it means the surviving children of the deceased brothers and sisters. He intended to give the shares or legacies in the first place to his brothers and sisters ; and in the event of their death, or of any of them being dead, to their children: or, in other words, to the children of those who were dead, and to his brothers and sisters then living.
