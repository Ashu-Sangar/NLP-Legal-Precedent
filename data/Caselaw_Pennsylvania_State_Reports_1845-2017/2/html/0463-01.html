      <em>May </em>21. — This was an appeal from a decree distributing the proceeds of the estate of John Brown, under the following circumstances, found by the auditor, and which do not appear to have been disputed.</p>

Zachariah Brown, one of the sons, is stated to have been acting under a power of attorney from the other heirs to transact their business at the time of the purchase by him, presently stated. In June, 1840, after J. B.’s death, the land was sold for taxes to S. R., for $10; taxes and costs being $4 28, and a bond given for the surplus. In the spring of 1842, Z. B. refused to redeem the land as attorney for the other heirs, but took an assignment thereof from S. R. for $10, and the previous taxes. Nothing is said in the report as to whether Z. B. had any money of the heirs in his hands; nor are any other facts stated than are mentioned here, unless, as is stated in third exception in this court, the land was purchased with trust funds. This, however, was not found by the report.</p>

B. was levied by the defendants therein, and the land in question extended at $75 per annum ; at which the heirs refusing to accept, the land was sold, and the money arising thereunder paid into court for distribution. The auditor, considering Z. B. had been guilty of a breach of trust, by reason of which no title had passed to him as against the heirs of J. B., distributed the fund — 1st. To the costs of the nonsuit; 2d. Dividing the residue into seven parts, he gave Z. B.’s portion to appellants, under their judgment, and the other six portions among the other heirs of J. B., or their representatives, equally.</p>

Brown, on a judgment against him alone, his creditors would be entitled to receive the money arising from the sale, without any regard to opposing titles, well or ill-founded. And the reason is, that in such case the sheriff sells the interest of the debtor only; the right of the claimants to the land remaining unimpaired. It would be open to them, notwithstanding the sale, to assert their title by action of ejectment against the sheriff’s vendee, the maxim being caveat emptor. But where, as in this case, the judgment on which the sale is had is against several, as the sheriff’s sale passes to the sheriff’s vendee the rights of all against whom the judgment is rendered, the necessity of the case requires a different rule. The money raised by the sale, by the operation of law being substituted for the land, the proceeds (after paying the joint judgments) must be distributed to the owners of the real estate, whether the title be legal or equitable. In this way only can justice be done. Thus, when, on a joint judgment against two, the land of one is sold, the residue, after paying the joint debts, must be paid over to the owner of the estate sold, in exclusion of the other joint debtor and his creditors. The land is only liable in respect to the joint liens, and when they are paid, the remainder belongs to the owner of the estate. This is so obviously just as not to need the aid of either authority or argument.</p>

This state of facts makes it necessary to examine the extent and nature of the title of Zachariah G. Brown. The land being converted into money, it is impracticable, by any other mode, to protect the equitable interest of the joint debtors to the estate sold by the sheriff.</p>

The tract of land was sold by the Treasurer of Hunting-don county, on the second Monday of June, 1840, to Thomas Reed, for the sum of ten dollars. The taxes and costs were four dollars and twenty-eight cents, and tire bond of Thomas Reed was given for the overplus, and filed in the prothonotary’s office. In the spring of 1842, Zachariah G. Brown, acting under the authority of a general power of <a id="p466" href="#p466" data-label="466" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*466</a>attorney from all the heirs of John Brown, refused to redeem the land as the attorney for the heirs, but obtained from Thomas Reed an assignment of the treasurer’s deed to himself, and for his own use, for the consideration of ten dollars, and the payment of the previous taxes and costs. The auditor correctly decided that, by this proceeding, Z. G. Brown acted in dereliction of the trust reposed in him, and the duty he owed the other heirs, and that the equitable title was not divested. <em>Ey </em>virtue of the treasurer’s sale, and the conveyance of the purchaser, Zachariah G. Brown, it is true, became seised of the legal title, but in trust for his constituents, viz., himself and the other heirs. For their benefit alone had he authority to purchase. Courts of justice exact the most scrupulous good faith from agents of every description during the continuance of the agency. To prevent fraud, they cannot purchase the estate of-their principals for their own benefit, but in trust. If the principal ratifies the purchase, with a full knowledge of all the circumstances, it validates it, for the sale is not void, but voidable. But that cannot be urged here, for the heirs took the earliest opportunity to assert their rights as the equitable owners, in part, of the land, and as such entitled, after payment of the joint debts, to a fair distribution of the proceeds of sale. These principles are enforced in many cases. Thus it is rule* that one of two devisees cannot purchase an encumbrance on their joint estate, and use it to sell the land, and deprive the other of his property. In that case, he is but a trustee. So when two tenants in common had heard of an adverse title, and agreed to join in'defending against it, or in purchasing, they are bound to deal fairly with each other. The purchase of one accrues to the benefit of both. If one purchases the title for a small sum, he must hold it in trust for the other. These principles are fully stated by Mr. Justice Huston in Smiley <em>v. </em>Dixon, 1 Penna. Rep. 441, and are supported by the authorities. When confidence is reposed, the law forbids it shall be abused. To prevent abuse, it turns the purchaser into a trustee, Rankin <em>v. </em>Porter, <a href="/watts/7/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="7 Watts 390" data-case-ids="1846764" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0390-01">7 Watts, 390</a>.</p>
