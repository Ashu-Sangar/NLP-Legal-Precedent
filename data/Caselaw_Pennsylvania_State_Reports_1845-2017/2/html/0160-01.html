After that decision it was found that trusts descended, in Virginia, as beneficial interests to children equally; whereupon an amended bill was filed against all the heirs of John Barclay, for a conveyance. A decree for a conveyance was made. One of the defendants, a feme covert, signed and acknowledged the deed, but refused to acknowledge that it was done voluntarily, &amp;c.; the law of Virginia being imperative, and the deed a nullity, as to her, without it.</p>
