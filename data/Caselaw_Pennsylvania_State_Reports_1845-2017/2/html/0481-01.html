      <em>May </em>19. — This action was brought in February, 1844, on two sealed instruments, dated in 1820, which were written on one sheet of paper. To rebut the presumption of payment, the plaintiff showed endorsements of payments in 1824 and 1840, by one of the two obligors. He also gave in evidence receipts for these sums, produced on demand, by the administrator of the parly who paid the amounts, and an admission by one of the parties to the instrument, within sixteen years, that the debt had not been paid. The defendant also gave evidence of an assertion by himself, uncontradicted by plaintiff, that but a small balance, if any, remained due. The plaintiff’s exceptions were to the answer of the court to the second and third points proposed, •which in substance were:</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b481-7" data-blocks='[["BL_481.7",481,[134,1348,1180,142]]]'>1. The presumption of payment goes to the <em>whole </em>of the debt. If any part remains unpaid, and defendants have not shown what part, plaintiffs may recover the whole.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b481-8" data-blocks='[["BL_481.8",481,[134,1495,1182,141]]]'>Ans. — When the presumption of payment has arisen, such presumption may be repelled so far as plaintiff’s testimony may authorize the jury so to do.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b481-9" data-blocks='[["BL_481.9",481,[134,1640,1184,285]]]'>2. If there was a payment of part, and an acknowledgment of the debt within twenty years, the burden of proof is on defendant; and if other circumstances are relied on, to raise a presumption of payment, and it appears from these facts that a part did remain unpaid, such evidence raises no evidence of presumption against the claim, there being no distinct evidence what the balance was.</p>

This we contend is not the law. That there was a presumption of payment arising from lapse of time, and when this presumption arose, the plaintiff, in addition to proving his bond, was bound to show additional circumstances tending to prove that the bond was not paid.</p>

The law is undoubtedly so; but the direction actually given, though accurate in most particulars, did not entirely respond to the prayer. Payment of interest, or a part of the principal, within the twenty years, repels the presumption entirely; and any acknowledgment that a part of the debt is due, entitles the plaintiff to recover, not only that part, but the whole, unless payment is proved by other evidence than lapse of time. It casts the proof of payment on the defendant, as if no presumption of payment had taken place.</p>
