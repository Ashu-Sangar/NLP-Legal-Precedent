      <em>Dec. </em>22. — Mitchell brought ejectment against three. The sheriff returned non est inventus as to McCredy, and served, as to the other two, and thirteen terre-tenants. Appearance was entered for McCredy, and a general plea on atwo day’s rule, with notice at bar. The jury were sworn generally. A sheriff’s sale subsequent to the writ having destroyed the plaintiff’s title, the court directed a verdict for nominal costs and damages.</p>

But as a party, for whom particular provision is made, may waive the benefit of itj we see no reason why the plaintiff, in this instance, might not elect to go on only against the persons named in the writ. Nor would we, in any event, reverse, for a mere clerical omission which did not prejudice <em>them; </em>and <em>they </em>certainly had no interest in having additional parties who could not be made liable to contribution.</p>
