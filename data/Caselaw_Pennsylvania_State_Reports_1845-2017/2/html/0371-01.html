      <em>April </em>20. — An auditor having been appointed to distribute the funds in the hands of the assignees of Roberts, Susan Rossiter, who was his ward, claimed payment of a sum received by him, and loaned to Thomas Rossiter, which had been received by Roberts’ assignees; and offered declarations of Roberts, made before his assignment, to prove the loan was with her money. The auditor and court rejected the testimony, on the ground that Roberts himself might have been called to prove the fact.</p>

Ev., 660-665. The very point was decided in Woolf <em>v. </em>Eichelberger, <em>2 </em>Penna. 346. In Harrisburg Bank <em>v. </em>Tyler, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20273" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 273">3 Watts &amp; Serg. 273</a>, money was thus traced through several investments, though it is true the party was dead. But we are not bound to call him as a witness; his declarations are sufficient, and we may not choose to trust him. The declarations of a bankrupt before bankruptcy are good against his assignees, Mark <em>v. </em>Barker, 1 W. C. C. R. 185; and this court, in Twelves <em>v. </em>Williams, decided, assignees for creditors are in the same situation as the assignor.</p>

It is no objection to receiving such admissions in evidence, that the party making them is living and capable of being called as a witness, as was decided by this court in Gibblehouse <em>v. </em>Strong, <a href="/rawle/3/0437-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Rawle 437" data-case-ids="1822539" data-case-paths="/rawle/3/0437-01">3 Rawle, 437</a>. Indeed, in many cases, a party would be estopped by such previous admissions from controverting their truth where it would operate to the wrong of others. On this principle, it would seem that the admissions of Joseph Roberts, that he had loaned to Thomas Rossiter the money of his ward, would be evidence against him that this was the truth. And if they would be evidence against him, there seems to be no reason why they would not be so against assignees under a voluntary assignment made by him after the admissions, who hold merely his title and stand in his place. That they take for the benefit of creditors, does not raise them to a higher grade than that occupied by their assignor, nor discharge the estate in their hands from the equities and trusts which attached to it while he held it, has been frequently decided.</p>
