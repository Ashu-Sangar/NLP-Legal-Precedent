It is also important from the extent of other titles involved, more than nine hundred of these acts having been passed, and many of them the foundation of hundreds of titles. Is the title such a doubtful one as the court will refuse its aid to perfect ? The argument will be divided into, whether a power exists independent of the act, and therefore that is merely a shorter method; and, second, the power under the act alone. That the estates after the life-estates are remainders, and not executory devises, need not be argued, Dunwoodie <em>v. </em>Reed, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%20441" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Serg. &amp; Rawle 441">3 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 441</a>.

The cases of charities are on a peculiar footing; the beneficiaries are uncertain — belonging to a class constantly changing.

Those are few and peculiar. Fearne, 326, sect. 10, where the mere naked outstanding legal estate prevents the real owner from having a perfect fee. Fearne, 336, 331.</p>

And it may be doubted whether our common law has not given the same powers and incidents to the equitable owner that the legal estate possessed, as in Willing <em>v. </em>Brown, <a href="/serg-rawl/7/0467-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="7 Serg. &amp; Rawle 467" data-case-ids="1808144" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/7/0467-01">7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 467</a>, where it was decided they might sue in partition.</p>

But it is said the Bill of Rights prohibits this act. The first section is abstract, incapable of being enforced by the courts. As to the sixth section, no right to a trial ever existed. The ninth section evidently refers to accused persons, and has no bearing on this case. Of the tenth section, the first part relates to criminal proceedings, and the latter to a matter different from the present. None of these interfere with this prerogative of parliament, to which the legislature has succeeded, in passing an act for the preservation of property, which this is. [ <em>Chief Justice. </em>— The expression in <a href="/watts/10/0063-01" class="citation" data-index="39" data-cite="10 Watts 63" data-case-ids="1851017" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0063-01">10 Watts, 63</a>, Harvey <em>v. </em>Thomas, was inadvertently used.] The constitution must be construed with reference to that lex non scripta, the law of custom, which has always prevailed. Thus, in case of divorce, which is a contract, a special prohibition was required. So of insolvent and limitation laws, of which the real ground is not that the remedy only is impaired, for if all remedy is taken away, clearly the contract is impaired; but that these laws had always been enacted, and no one thought of prohibiting them. There is nothing which prohibits the entire destruction of contingent remainders. Numerous cases show the power to sell, even without security, has been given to strangers, or persons having but particular estates. I would not contend for the extreme case of taking one man’s property and giving it to another. The evils prohibited were practical ones, under which the people had suffered, such as attainders. We have then uniform practice sanctioned by the highest names in the judiciary, and uniform legislation. If it cannot be done, the city must stand still. This estate on the north, Powelton on the west, Blackwell and Wharton’s estate on the south, hem us completely in, and for half a century the growth of the city must be stopped to protect contingent remainders.</p>

Such a direction would doubtless be given where the consequence would be a plain benefit to the family, (and the direction which the legislature has given to this property is certainly more beneficial to the family than that which had been given to it by the testator,) but I am unable to perceive how the contingent limitations could be defeated by a fine, recovery, feoffment, or any conveyance which, on feudal principles, would work a forfeiture of an estate for life. Trustees, to support contingent remainders, take the estate in remainder for the life of the particular tenant, after the determination of his freehold by forfeiture; and they may still defeat the dependent remainders as he would have done, by destroying their own freehold, when nothing else is left to support them. Here the trustees have had the legal estate in fee from the beginning; and no conveyance of theirs could extinguish it by forfeiture for an attempt to create one of no more than equal magnitude. With or without the decree of a chancellor, therefore, they could not have destroyed their own estate; and they consequently could not have destroyed the contingent limitations dependent on it. They might have conveyed it; but not being extinct, it would have performed the same office in the hands of their grantee.</p>

It stands on the notions of parliamentary power, brought by our forefathers from .the land of their birth, and handed down to their descendants unimpaired, in the apprehension of any one, by constitutional restriction of ordinary legislation. A list of nine hundred statutes, in principle like the present, has been laid before us; some of them enacted at the instance of judges of this <em>court; </em>some at the instance of law judges of the Common Pleas; and some at the instance of learned and eminent lawyers, most of whom executed trusts under them without suspecting that their authority was prohibited by the constitution. It is not above the mark to say that ten thousand titles depend on legislation of the stamp. For many of those statutes contain distinct provisions for more than twenty estates. And could not the ruin that would be produced by disturbing them be avoided by any thing less than a convention to effect a constitutional sanction of them, the consummation would not be dearly bought. Fortunately there is no need of a measure so grave. Many of the preeminent men who framed the constitution of 1790, iu which it was first <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>attempted to impose specific restrictions on the power of the legislature over property, were returned as members in the succeeding years; and we find no opposition to such enactments on constitutional grounds. This remedial legislation has prevailed from the foundation of the province to this day, not, indeed, exactly as it has prevailed in England, where, though the power of parliament is absolute, statutes which infringe upon private property are enacted with extreme caution, yet certainly with caution enough to prevent any sacrifice of private right. In the ten thousand cases to which I have referred, there is not, perhaps, one by which an individual was prejudiced, while it is almost entirely certain that all were benefited. In those instances the legislature was not adverse but subservient to the protection of vested estates; and due care was taken to provide for the security of contingent ones. On what part of the constitution, then, could it be supposed to trench ? The only restrictive clauses which could be supposed to reach it, even by the most forced construction, are found in the ninth and tenth sections of the declaration of rights, in which it is said that no one “ can be deprived of his life, liberty, or property, unless by the judgment of his peers, or the law of the land.” “Nor shall any man’s property be taken or applied to public use wdthout just compensation being made.” Now, it cannot be said that this statute has deprived any man of his property, or applied it to any other use than his own. The estate is to remain in the trustees; altered, indeed, as to kind, but still applicable to the trusts in the will. It is to be let on perpetual or redeemable ground-rents at the option of the trustees, who are to give such security as the judges of the Common Pleas may require for the due investment of such parts of it as may eventually be turned into money by redemption. Now, as the constitution allows to the legislature every power which it does not positively prohibit, I am at a loss to perceive, in these or any other of its clauses, an ascription of such sanctity to testamentary directions, as to exclude the interference of the legislature with regulations merely modal, for the advancement of interests both private and public. By a due execution of the powers conferred by this statute, not only will the welfare of the family, but the extention of the city be promoted. It would be fraught with incalculable mischief to let a doubt rest on the power of the legislature ; and we are entirely clear that the relief sought by the bill be granted.</p>
