      <em>May </em>13. — Haines, administrator of H. Share, issued a sci. fa. to revive a judgment obtained by H. Share &amp; Co., against plaintiff' in error, intestate in 1815. A former proceeding had been commenced in the name of Mehaffy, surviving partner of H. Share &amp; Co., which, on writ of error, was reversed on the ground that the words <em>“ Sc </em>Co.” should have been treated as surplusage in a court of law. The case is reported in <a href="/watts-serg/7/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 276" data-case-ids="481807" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0276-01">7 Watts &amp; Serg. 276</a>.

On the <em>22d </em>March, 1845, the pleadings were amended, with leave of the court. On the <em>12th </em>April, 1845, the defendant filed a rejoinder. On the 17th April, 1845, (the time appointed to choose arbitrators,) the defendant made an entry that he ‘withdraws his application to have arbitrators chosen,’ and on the same day, the plaintiff attended to choose arbitrators, and the defendant not attending, the arbitrators were chosen by the plaintiff and the prothonotary, in the manner required by law where only one of the parties attends. The question is, whether the appointment of arbitrators should be stricken off. The entry of a rule of reference, under the compulsory system of arbitration, is a proceeding which <em>either </em>party may adopt, and in which <em>both </em>have an interest, when adopted. The entry of the rule by one, prevents the other from making a similar entry — two proceedings of the kind cairnot progress together. The entry of the rule also has the effect of taking the cause off the trial list for the ensuing term, if placed there; or, if not, of preventing it from being placed on the list. This is the constant effect in practice. It follows, from these considerations, that the rule, when entered, cannot be withdrawn w'ithout the consent of the opposite party, and without leave of the court. The reason assigned for withdrawing the rule may have been a good one, for a <em>continuance, </em>if the party was taken by surprise by the amendment of the pleadings, but it is no reason for changing the jurisdiction, or withdrawing from the tribunal previously selected for the trial of the cause. The entry withdrawing the rule was irregular, and the appointment of <a id="p437" href="#p437" data-label="437" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*437</a>arbitrators, in disregard of it, seems to be according to law.

On the 17th April, 1845, the arbitrators were chosen, and on the next day the defendant moved to strike off the appointment for the reason set forth in the motion. On the 19th April, 1845, this motion was overruled. On the 3d May, 1845, an award was filed, in favour of the plaintiff, for the sum of <em>$9329 20; </em>and on the 10th May, 1845, the present motion was made to strike off <em>‘ </em>the arbitration proceedings and awTard.’ The reason assigned on the former motion is again urged on the present occasion. Several additional reasons are also relied upon. The ground that the party entering the rule had withdrawn it has been specifically determined, and nothing further remains to be said upon that part of the case. The additional objection is now, for the first time, made, that <em>“ </em>the number of the arbitrators was not fixed by the prothonotary.” It is conceded, that if it appears by _the record that one party, in the absence of the other, was permitted to participate in fixing the number, the objection is fatal, according to the decisions in <a href="/watts/6/0260-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts 260" data-case-ids="1846050" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0260-01">6 Watts, 260</a>, and <a href="/watts-serg/7/0183-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 183" data-case-ids="481812" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0183-01">7 Watts &amp; Serg. 183</a>. In those cases, the illegal participation of the attending party was distinctly affirmed upon the record. But this is not the state of the fact upon the record before us. It is stated, in this case, that the party attending, and the prothonotary, <em>chose </em>the arbitrators, and that, after choosing-three, the <em>prothonotary fixed </em>the <em>time </em>and <em>place </em>of meeting. The record is silent upon the question of fixing the <em>number, </em>and we are not informed of the method by which that was decided, unless it be inferred from the fact that the prothonotary arrested the further proceedings, after <em>three </em>had been chosen, by fixing the time and place of meeting; and thus, by his own act, limiting the number to three. There is a presumption in this, as in all similar cases, that the officer, acting under oath, has performed his duty according to law, and this presumption is certainly not diminished in strength by the certificate, <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>in the rule issued to the arbitrators, upon which they acted, that they were £ <em>appointed according to law? </em>This presumption acquires additional force when it is considered that, on the former motion to set aside the appointment, no allegation was made that the prothonolary had not fixed the number, but the objection to the appointment was placed and decided upon a different ground. Under the circumstances, it is fair to presume that the appointment was properly made in this respect, or, if not, that the objection now taken, and all other objections which might have been urged upon the first motion, are waived.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b438-4" data-blocks='[["BL_438.4",438,[339,880,1201,1257]]]'>££ Since the appointment of the arbitrators, and before the time for hearing, the parties filed a rejoinder — a surrejoinder, a demurrer, and a joinder in demurrer — thus making up an issue in <em>law, </em>in addition to the issue in <em>fact, </em>on the plea of payment with leave. If the issue in law discloses a legal ground of defence, the award should be set aside, or judgment should be rendered for the defendant non obstante. As the demurrer brings into examination all the previous pleading upon which it is founded, it will be sufficient for the decision of this application to inquire into the validity of the plea £ that the bond and warrant of attorney upon which the original judgment of 1815 was entered, was altered in material parts without the consent of the obligor.’ It is not necessary to consider the lapse of time, the proceedings upon the judgment, the several motions to set it aside upon this ground, and the decisions of the court against them. It is sufficient to say, that so long as the judgment remains of record, it must be taken for verity, and cannot be impeached in this proceeding by the matters set forth in the plea. It is settled that in cases of mistake, fraud, want of. authority to make the entry, and even forgery, the remedy is to apply to the court in which the proceedings or judgments were had, to have them opened, referred, or vacated, as may be requisite.
