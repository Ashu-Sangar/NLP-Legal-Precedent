      <em>Feb. 22. </em>— B. <em>F. Brewster </em>moved for an allocatur on writ of error to the Quarter Sessions. In support of the rule he stated two grounds : 1. The indictment, which was for assault and battery, &amp;c., was defective in not containing any words to distinguish it from an ordinary trespass. <em>[Chief Justice. </em>— We never grant a writ of error in criminal cases for mere technical matters not going to the merits.] 2. It was tried before one judge, who has no power, under the constitution, to hold the court, and Zephon’s case only decided that the legislature might make any one judge president for the time.</p>

As then established, any two of the judges were competent to constitute a quorum: when directed otherwise by law, any one of them might be equally so. The framers of the constitution could not have intended to prevent the legislature from adapting these courts to the exigencies of new times and new circumstances, or to make it necessary to resort to fundamental legislation for the most trivial alterations. The power exercised in this case is inore clearly within the pale of the constitution than that which was held to be so in Zephon <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth. That was within the spirit of the constitution ; but this is within the spirit and the letter too. But nothing less than an imperative case would justify us in disregarding an act of the legislature at the expense of <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>throwing open the jails and turning loose on the community the malefactors convicted in a course of years. The other grounds of exception are still more obviously unfounded; and besides, we never grant an allocatur for an exception that does not touch the question of guilt or innocence. Motion dismissed.</p>
