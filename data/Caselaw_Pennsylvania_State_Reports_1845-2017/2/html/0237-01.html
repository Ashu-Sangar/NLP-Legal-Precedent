      <em>Feb. </em>25. — In May, 1835, plaintiff purchased of defendants bills on London for ,£7000. By an agreement, then executed, these were to be drawn at one hundred and eighty days’ sight, and not to be negotiated but to the eastward of the Cape of Good Hope. The defendant was to give his note at twelve months, at the rate of $5 for ¿61.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b237-8" data-blocks='[["BL_237.9",237,[167,1908,1189,535]]]'>The agreement then continued, “ On payment of this note at maturity, the bank will adjust the account, by converting the pounds sterling on the face of the bills, plus two and a half per cent., into dollars, at whatever rate of exchange the bank may then be drawing, at sixty days’ sight, on London, and should this amount in dollars exceed or fall short of the said payment, the bank shall, in the first case, receive from the said Keener, and in the last case, refund to him the difference.” If the bills were returned unnegotiated, the note was to be surrendered on payment of one per cent. So also, if lost, and proof thereof and indemnity. But no interest was to be allowed by the bank, however long it might he before return or proof of loss.</p>

This, after several renewals, was paid, and the present suit was to recover back the interest paid the bank, after the maturity of the first note, until the maturity of the bills in England. In May 12, 1837, plaintiff, writing to the bank, requesting a renewal, said, “ As the delay was of no ordinary character, and contrary to instructions, I cannot suppose it is the intention of the bank to charge interest during all this period, as there was none accruing on the bills.” The note was renewed, but the letter does not appear to have been replied to.</p>

After referring to his letter of the 12th May, he added, “To this part of my letter no particular answer was returned at the time; and as the bank was indulgent in regard to the payment of the notes, I let the matter rest, and did not urge the claim. It is true, I might have refused to pay the last note without the allowance being made; but I thought it more consistent with a strict sense of justice and honour to pay up the full amount of my notes <em>first, </em>before I renewed my claim.” In reply, beside insisting on the agreement having been strictly complied with, the bank stated this delay was no unusual occurrence, and was one of the advantages counted on.</p>

That in the settlement of credits arising out of such transactions, it was the invariable custom to allow the <em>principal any advantage in interest </em>which might accrue from the non-appearance of bills drawn in virtue of such credits.</p>

Under the agreement the plaintiff was bound to pay the note at maturity, whether the bills were or were not paid. It was a sale of foreign money — an article of merchandise, and so treated by courts. The agreement was by both parties; one had a certain credit of twelve months, without interest, the other the chance of delay in the presentation. The <em>difference </em>in the agreement was between the value of foreign money and the note at the settlement; not the amount of interest. The testimony offered was irrelevant to a special contract, according to the settled rule of this court, and his reference to « principal” shows the custom referred to was as to bills on an agent.</p>

No one can doubt for a moment, from the tenor and legal effect of the notes, if the plaintiff had failed to pay, and had not arranged the principal of the notes at the end of the twelve months mentioned therein, he might have been sued on them, and compelled to pay, not only the principal, but likewise the accruing interest thereon, from the time the principal became payable, according to the tenor of the notes. And if he had thus been compelled to pay the interest by suit, it will scarcely be pretended that, after having so paid it, he could have recovered it back. Then, is it not equally clear, that having paid it voluntarily, when he might have been compelled by law to pay it, that he cannot recover it back again ? It would be most strange and anomalous if he could. The parties, by their agreement, seeing that it was not unlawful in any respect, naade a law for themselves, which bound them, and by it, and it alone, their rights were to be, and must be determined ; so that no custom could be admitted to be proved, which would go to defeat and change the nature and plain legal effect of the agreement made between them.</p>
