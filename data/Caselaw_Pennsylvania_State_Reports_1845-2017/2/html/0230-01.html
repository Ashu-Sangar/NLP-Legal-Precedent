      <em>Feb. </em>24. — This was an action on the case for the destruction, by a mob, of a school-house, the property of the plaintiff, formerly used by the Sisters of Charity, and occupied at the time. The plaintiff was the pastor of St. Michael’s Church, and resided in the parsonage, but had been absent tor some time. He officiated in the church on the 5th, and the next day went into the country, some miles from town — no disturbance having then taken place. The house was destroyed on the 7th. The defence endeavoured to be established was, such conduct as excluded him from remedy under the 8th sect, of the act of 1841, p. 418, providing that no one shall be entitled to the benefit of the act, if it shall appear the destruction was caused “ by bis illegal or improper conduct.” His honour, the Chief Justice, overruled a question as to when the men first collected in the church on the evening of the 7th. They then showed that on the evening of the 7th, a number of armed men came out of the church, and offered to show that this body fired upon an unarmed assemblage in*front of the school-house, but it was rejected for the same reason, to wit, no connection with plaintiff being shown.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b230-14" data-blocks='[["BL_230.15",230,[328,2218,1184,235]]]'>The notice proved was, that Frenaje, who had a power of attorney to sell the house, but no other authority, called with others on the sheriff, and told him of the general apprehension of the destruction of the church, and said, “ If the church went, the school-house would go too.”</p>

    <p id="b231-5" data-blocks='[["BL_231.5",231,[170,582,1040,34]]]'>1st. That the notice in this case to the sheriff was insufficient.</p>
    <p id="b231-6" data-blocks='[["BL_231.6",231,[123,632,1194,238]]]'>2d. It was insufficient, inasmuch as what is alleged to be notice was not given by the party owner, or any one authorized by him; and inasmuch as Mr. Frenaye did not give notice of any intended attack, but merely expressed his apprehension that if the church was burnt the school-house would be destroyed.</p>
    <p id="b231-7" data-blocks='[["BL_231.7",231,[125,874,1190,92]]]'>3d. That the notice must be distinct and explicit in stating an intended attack, or intention to collect a mob for that purpose.</p>
    <p id="b231-8" data-blocks='[["BL_231.8",231,[167,973,1148,43]]]'>4th. That the firing from the school-house was improper and illegal.</p>
    <p id="b231-9" data-blocks='[["BL_231.9",231,[126,1023,1191,91]]]'>5th. That if there was improper or illegal conduct from the parties in possession, the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>
    <p id="b231-10" data-blocks='[["BL_231.10",231,[126,1121,1192,189]]]'>6th. That if the persons in charge of the house invited others to enter with arms, to be used against the crowd, and those persons did so, they became parties to the riot, and their improper or illegal conduct is a bar to the plaintiff’s recovery.</p>
    <p id="b231-11" data-blocks='[["BL_231.11",231,[123,1316,1195,481]]]'>The learned judge charged, that if the facts sworn to are true, the sheriff had sufficient notice of the apprehended danger. Also, that if the shots were not fired from the building before the mob attacked it, the firing was justifiable. That the building was a dwelling-house, and castle for family defence; and that a homicide in resistance of a felony is justifiable, especially if committed in the night. That it was justifiable to introduce men and arms into the house, as the exercise of a freeman’s privilege, whether there was an apprehension of danger or <em>not; </em>and that if the mob was not fired on till after it had begun the attack, this part of the defence had failed.</p>
    <p id="b231-12" data-blocks='[["BL_231.12",231,[123,1803,1192,142]]]'>The errors assigned were, the overruling the testimony offered; the charge as to the notice being sufficient either in form or by the proper person ; the defect in the declaration, in not setting forth the ward.</p>
