      <em>May </em>22.- — -This was an action of trespass — pleas, non cul. and lib. ten. It appeared that Dysart, the plaintiff below, was the owner of a tract of land on which ivas a worm fence erected many years since.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b488-15" data-blocks='[["BL_488.12",488,[328,2286,1182,141]],["BL_489.1",489,[141,414,1185,188]]]'>The defendant owned the adjoining tract, and had placed a fence near that of plaintiff, and in a line with it, leaving a narrow lane between them, closed by a fence at one end. The trespass complained <a id="p489" href="#p489" data-label="489" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*489</a>of was the continuation of a fence on defendant’s land, across the unenclosed end of the lane, up to the fence on plaintiff’s land, and inserting rails therein, in the middle of a panel, extending through and over plaintiff’s land.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b489-4" data-blocks='[["BL_489.4",489,[142,608,1184,432]]]'>The first question was, whether plaintiff’s fence stood-on the boundary line. This was left to the jury. The second, which is the only matter of exception here, was the charge of the court, (Durkee, President,) that even if the fence had stood in the same place for twenty years, defendants were not liable as trespassers, unless it was exclusively on plaintiff’s land. But if it was on the line, defendants could at any time extend their enclosure up to it, and use it as they had done ; and this the court considered a fair construction of the act for regulating partition fences.</p>

He admitted the right of the defendants to come to the plaintiff’s fence ; but denied that they had any right to join their fence to it, or to run the rails or poles of their fence through it. [iíqg-ers, J.- — There can be no adverse right, by lapse of time, to a division line or fence, or to a party wall.

An occupant has a right to place his fence exactly on his <a id="p490" href="#p490" data-label="490" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*490</a>boundary, in anticipation of,its becoming a division-fence; and consequently as much on his neighbour’s land as on his own. His occupancy of so much of it as happens to be necessary, like the possession of a tenant in common, is not adverse, but for the benefit of both ; and, as it is not an ouster, it can neither give nor take away a right. As the statute itself does not run, no presumption from non-user in analogy to it can have any effect; for conterminous owners are no more bound to clear and fence their lands within a particular period, to preserve their interest in a division-fence, than they are bound to build within a particular time to preserve their interest in a partition wall. Such, in substance, is the exposition of the act of 1700, by the court below, and it is a sound one.</p>
