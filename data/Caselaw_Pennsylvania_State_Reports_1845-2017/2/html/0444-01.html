      <em>May </em>13. — In this case a rule was entered to choose arbitrators on 17th May, at which time defendant not appearing, they were named and an award made. A motion was made to set aside the proceedings, which was based on an affidavit, that the date had been altered in the rule from the 10th to the 17th, after it was filed, which facts were admitted, but the court refused to set aside the proceedings, as no injury was alleged to have accrued by the alteration.</p>

Act of June 16, 1836, Pamph. Laws, 715, sect. 8, c. 57.</p>
    <p id="b444-8" data-blocks='[["BL_444.9",444,[307,1316,1181,335]]]'>The party cannot alter the time either in the notice or upon the record, after having been once entered. Having taken his rule, he is bound to abide his time — the time fixed by himself. If he has made a mistake, or does not choose to proceed to the choice of arbitrators at that time, he may allow it to pass, and upon a full expiration of the same, may then strike it off or treat it as a nullity, and commence de novo by taking out another rule.</p>
    <p id="b444-9" data-blocks='[["BL_444.10",444,[305,1656,1180,478]]]'>The propriety, as well as the reason of this, is sufficiently obvious. If a different rule were to prevail, then there would be no certainty in the rights of parties. They would be subjected to continual inconvenience. For if one party taking out a rule of reference may alter the time of choosing arbitrators, after being once entered, to a more remote period, then he may do' it again, and so on ad infinitum, to the prejudice and great inconvenience of the other. This surely was not the intention of the legislature, and ought not to be recognised in practice by the courts. Hence the judgment of the court below is erroneous. 2 Troub. &amp; Haly’s Prac. 560.</p>

It was found impracticable to go on with the proceeding, at the time originally fixed for choosing the arbitrators; and no more ivas done by the clerk than to insert a more distant day. Had the opposite party already received notice, it is possible the case might have been different; but as the notice was given after the alteration, the same thing was effected as if the rule had been discharged, an'd a fresh one entered. The defendants received due notice of the true time, and every thing was regular.</p>
