      <em>May </em>26. — This was an action against a surety on an insolvent bond, in which the jury found a special verdict: viz., that judgment was obtained against Cornwell in 1839, before a justice, and an appeal taken with defendant as his bail, conditioned to surrender, &amp;c., if judgment was had and not paid. After award, judgment was' obtained, bail having been entered, on appeal from the award under the compulsory arbitration act, in April, 1842. A bond conditioned to apply for a discharge as insolvent, was approved on the 13th of July, 1842, and on the 1st of August, the defendant in the execution being then in custody of his bail, an exoneretur was entered as to the bail, it appearing said bond had been given to appear and abide all orders, &amp;c.

And the jurisdiction of the judge was exercised under the provisions of the 4th section, authorizing him to discharge a debtor so detained, on his giving bond with security approved of by the judge, with the condition prescribed by the 6th section of the same act. Such arrest by a bail-piece was taken away by the legislature before the arrest was made. The act of Assembly abolishing imprisonment for debt virtually repealed that part of the act relating to insolvent debtors which-authorizes the jurisdiction of the courts to be exercised in the case of a person held on a bail-piece, issued in any civil suit or proceeding for the recovery of any money or damages upon contract. The act takes away the right of the bail to arrest on a bail-piece, and, of course, does not contemplate such case thereafter to exist (whereas in this case it was on a civil contract for the recovery of money) upon <a id="p493" href="#p493" data-label="493" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*493</a>which the judge should exercise the power given by the 6th section of the act relating to insolvent debtors, under which this bond was taken. And I am of opinion that the bail in such bond will be relieved in all cases where the bond is given by the principal to procure his discharge from an arrest that was illegal.</p>

All such recognisances or obligations authorized by law to secure to the creditor the body, whether they authorized the bail to surrender the principal or the principal to surrender himself in discharge of the obligation, were by the act abolished, and any such obligation given under an unauthorized arrest, may, on a plea in bar, by the bail be defeated.</p>

During that term, the court, on motion, set aside the capias ad satisfaciendum, and the defendant did not apply by petition for the benefit of the insolvent laws. Held, that the bond was not forfeited, but became inoperative, when.the process was set aside.’ Here also the bond was inoperative, in consequence of the act passed, relieving the body of the defendant from arrest. The basis upon which this bond was given had been taken away by the legislature, but this was not known to the parties at the time. The basis being gone, there wras nothing to support the bond. In the case referred to, the Supreme Court say ‘ the bond was but a substitute for the imprisonment.’ So in this case, the bond was but a substitute for the imprisonment, and had the defendant been detained in prison when arrested on the bail-piece, on hearing that an act had been passed relieving him from arrest, he could have at once been discharged. The act of Assembly had relieved him from imprisonment, where he might be held to answer the judgment of the plaintiff, as the law stood at the time the recognisances were entered into, and as understood by the parties, at the time the bond conditioned to take the benefit of the insolvent laws was given. This remedy against the body was directly taken away by the legislature, and a surrender of himself on the bond would have been merely nominal.

Whenever it is shown that a defendant is not subject to arrest, it is matte! of course to order an exoneretur.’</p>
