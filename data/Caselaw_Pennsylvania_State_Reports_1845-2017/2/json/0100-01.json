But as a party, for whom particular provision is made, may waive the benefit of itj we see no reason why the plaintiff, in this instance, might not elect to go on only against the persons named in the writ. Nor would we, in any event, reverse, for a mere clerical omission which did not prejudice them; and they certainly had no interest in having additional parties who could not be made liable to contribution.\nJudgment affirmed.",

It is not error to enter a nol. pros, as to some of the defendants after verdict, there being no contribution.\n3. Plaintiff in ejectment aliens after suit brought; he is entitled to judgment for nominal costs and damages.\nError to the Common Pleas of Montgomery county.\nDec. 22. \u2014 Mitchell brought ejectment against three. The sheriff returned non est inventus as to McCredy, and served, as to the other two, and thirteen terre-tenants. Appearance was entered for McCredy, and a general plea on atwo day\u2019s rule, with notice at bar. The jury were sworn generally. A sheriff\u2019s sale subsequent to the writ having destroyed the plaintiff\u2019s title, the court directed a verdict for nominal costs and damages.\nAfter verdict, plaintiff entered a nol. pros, as to all but the two defendants served, and judgment was entered.\nThe exceptions were, 1. To the judgment, plaintiff having no title at the time of the trial. 2. No evidence of the possession of McCredy. 3. No issue as to several defendants. 4. Entering nol. pros, after trial.\nMattery, for plaintiff\n\u2014 The rule to plead only extended to those appearing, and who did plead is but matter of inference.\nThe jury could only have been sworn as to those pleading, and this uncertainty is error.\nThe judgment should have been taken against those not appearing, under act 1807. This leaves two liable for all costs and mesne profits. Bratton v. Mitchell, 5 Watts, 69; Michew v. McCoy, 3 Watts & Serg. 501; Moss v. Moss, 5 Watts, 315; 1 Lord Ray. 729 ; 2 Salk. 476. A non pros, cannot then be entered. 1 Tidd, 632.\nFox and C. Fallon for defendant.\n\u2014 There was a general plea, behind which we could not go, and the jury must follow the record. The plea prevented us following the act of 1807. The nol. pros, was right; it amounted to an acquittal. Our action for mesne, profits is several, and there is no contribution, it being trespass. Brideman v. Vanderslice, 2 Rawle, 338 ; Bingh. Judg. 50; 6 Serg. & Rawle, 418.\n1st point. 4 Y. 382. [Gibson, C. J., there is no doubt of it.]\n2d. Appearance cured the defect.\nJan. 2."
