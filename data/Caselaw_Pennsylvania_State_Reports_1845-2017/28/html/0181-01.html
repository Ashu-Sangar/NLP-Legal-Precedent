    <p class="summary" id="b181-10" data-blocks='[["BL_181.9",181,[123,1071,1171,1107]]]'>This was an action on the case brought by John Koehler against Samuel Schnable, to recover damages for obstructing a certain private way. Koehler, the plaintiff, and Jacob Warner (of whom the defendant Schnable was tenant) owned adjoining lands, and the road in question followed the line, each one having his fence set back so as respectively to contribute equally to the road. It was proved to have been thus used by the parties and those under whom they respectively claimed for a period of more than thirty years. In the spring of 1847, the fence along a part of Warner’s side of this road had become old and dilapidated, and Samuel Schnable, the tenant, took it down and put up a new fence in its stead. For the purpose, as was alleged, of making this new fence straight, it was at some places set further out into the road and at others further back. There having been corresponding indentations on the other side of the lane, the road was thus made narrower where the new-fence was moved out. And this was the obstruction complained of. The plaintiff’s declaration complained of an obstruction to a certain way appurtenant to a close <em>in the possession of the plaintiff. </em>The evidence showed that it was in the possession of a tenant at the time of the committing of the injury complained of. The plaintiff, after the counsel for the defendant had concluded their addresses to the jury, asked leave to amend the declaration by alleging that the close was at the time in the possession of a tenant, and that the injury was done to tho plaintiff’s reversion. The defendant objected to it, as out of time, and that it introduced a new cause of action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b181-11" data-blocks='[["BL_181.10",181,[128,2185,1163,87]]]'>The court, however, permitted the amendment to be' made, and at the defendant’s instance sealed a bill of exceptions.</p>

That if the lands of the plaintiff were leased to and farmed by his son Conrad Koehler at the time of the alleged erection of the fence by the defendant and for several years before, and since until after suit brought, the plaintiff cannot recover, even if the fence obstructed the way in question, if the way was claimed as appurtenant to such land.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b182-10" data-blocks='[["BL_182.8",182,[298,1243,1168,427]]]'>2. That if the fence on the eastern side of the portion of the road alleged to be obstructed, and for the alteration of which the plaintiff complains, was originally erected a straight fence from corner to corner, and by the action of the wind, the lapse of time, decay of materials, or from other causes, portions of it became irregular and out of line, between the corners, the tenant or owner of the land on which it was erected had a right, in rebuilding his fence, to straighten the same between the corners, provided that in so doing he left a road equal in width and convenience to the remaining portion of the road.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b182-11" data-blocks='[["BL_182.9",182,[300,1670,1167,332]]]'>8. That if the owners of the land occupied by defendant, were not in possession of the same, but the said premises had been leased out for a term of years, the permission to the plaintiff or his tenants to enjoy an easement on the estate, even for the period of twenty-one years, would not affect the owner having the estate in remainder or reversion; and when he becomes in possession, he may dispute the right of the easement, and the length of enjoyment will be no obstacle to his claim.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b182-12" data-blocks='[["BL_182.10",182,[299,2012,1166,257]]]'>4. That if the road, notwithstanding the erection of the fence at the place in question, still leaves the plaintiff as convenient a road at that place as the other portions of the same road, which he must use, if he uses this, then the acts of the defendant in straightening the fence does not entitle the plaintiff to recover damages against him.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b182-14" data-blocks='[["BL_182.12",182,[299,2355,1165,86]],["BL_183.1",183,[143,414,1166,388]]]'>• “ 1. The amendment of the plaintiff’s declaration, to meet the proof of tenancy, disposes of this point. The declaration stated <a id="p183" href="#p183" data-label="183" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*183</a>that the land, appurtenant to which was this road, was in the possession of the plaintiff at the time of the obstruction made — ■ the proof was that it was in possession of the plaintiff’s tenant. If the pleadings had remained in that shape, the plaintiff could not have recovered. But the law allows a party to amend his pleadings, under direction of the court, according to the fact, so long as he does not introduce another cause of action. This amendment does not introduce such other cause of action, and, being allowed, saves the plaintiff’s right to maintain this action.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b183-6" data-blocks='[["BL_183.4",183,[146,802,1167,558]]]'>“ 2. It is certainly true, that if, by the operation of any natural or other causes, a fence slides off its original bed, the owner of the fence would have a right to restore it to its true and original position. But I cannot see any evidence in this case, though you may, that this fence ever was on any other line than on that which it occupied before Schnable straightened it, as it is called. Indeed, I cannot conceive how the action of the wind, lapse of time, or decay of materials, could, by any possibility, shift the position of a worm fence — particularly on level ground. When any shifting of the line of a fence takes place, the right is to restore it to its <em>original line </em>at the particular place where it has shifted, without any reference whatever to the road so restored being equal in width and convenience to the remaining part of the road.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b183-7" data-blocks='[["BL_183.5",183,[192,1361,895,42]]]'>££ 3. The law is correctly stated in this third point.</p>

      <em>“ </em>4. The law does not permit persons to contract roads, whether public or private roads, upon the plea of leaving'the public or the private party having a right to the road, as convenient a road as existed before. Where one has a right to a certain road — it is to that road, subject to no other man’s notion of what may be an equally convenient road — it is a right to that road, and not to an equivalent. If the plaintiff had a right to the use of that road <em>as it stood before the obstruction complained of, </em>he had a right to it as it was, irregular and out of line though it may have been. It is not the question whether the road is as convenient at that place, as it was before the erection of the fence in question — but whether that erection alters the road which the plaintiff had a right to have. If it does alter the road which the plaintiff had a right to have, supposing him to have had a right to a road there, then, even though it may be as convenient at that place as the other portions of the same road which he must use if he uses this, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover.</p>

The act complained of was the same. True enough, the liberality with which amendments are allowed in our practice does encourage slovenly and inaccurate habits among pleaders; but we think that this evil is more than compensated by the fact, that our practice discourages the hashing up of cases so as to give more prominence to the artificial forms of action than to the scientific principles of right which they are intended to present for decision and application.</p>
    <p id="b184-10" data-blocks='[["BL_184.10",184,[284,1367,1162,558]]]'>It is well settled that, for encroachments under a claim of right that is inconsistent with reversionary rights, the reversioner may have his action, though the immediate injury is merely nominal: <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2013" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 13">7 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>13</a>.

It could not contribute to good order to allow the parties to encroach upon a way on the ground that it is wider than necessary, and then ask a court and jury to sanction their act.
