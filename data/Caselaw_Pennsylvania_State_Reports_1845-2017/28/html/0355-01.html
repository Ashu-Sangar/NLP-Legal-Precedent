The defendant was the owner of a mill, and the bridges in question were over the head-race which conveyed the water through his own land to his mill at the points where it crossed two public roads. These roads were laid out and used before the race was dug. About the year 1806, a man by the name of Andrew Stocker, who then owned the mill, dug the race so as to obtain a greater fall of water, and placed bridges over it at the points where it crossed the roads, and kept them in repair so long as he continued owner of the mill.

See <em>Bac. Abr. </em>tit. <em>Bridges. </em>In the case of Rex <em>v. </em>The Inhabitants of West Riding, Yorkshire, 5 <em>Burr. </em>2594, it was held: “ If a bridge built by the county, is of utility to it, county to repair; but if built by a private person, and he has the benefit of it, he to repair.” The decision in Bolle is quoted in this case, and recognised as the law, decided in 1770.

The judgment of the court is based upon the Act 13th June, 1836, § 68, <em>Purd. </em>726, pi. 93, by which a-penalty of from $10 to $40 is imposed for obstruction or other nuisance, and therefore no other remedy can be resorted to. That act contemplates nuisance by positive acts of commission; and mere omissions, as the neglect to make these repairs, are not embraced in its provisions. This is only a means of punishment, but does not furnish a remedy for the injui-y the township has- sustained in being compelled to make the repairs.

The Acts of Assembly, cited for plaintiff in error, conferring the power on the District Courts, recognise a pre-existing practice, and were only needed to enable the points reserved by a single judge on the trial to be passed upon afterwards by the <em>whole </em>bench; a provision not necessary in the Common Pleas, where the trials are held by all the judges, and where there is but one judge required to be learned in the law.

Was there any liability on Woodring that could be enforced by a civil suit before a justice of the peace ? The court below held there was none. It is conceded that in order to recover, the township must establish a contract. The plaintiff endeavours to construct one, by showing that the supervisors are liable to indictment if the bridge is out of repair, and they may repair, and the law, from the liability of the digger of the race, will imply a contract to reimburse them. The court seemed to think there might be something akin to a covenant running with the land, that would be binding on the successive owners or tenants of the premises. Neither position is tenable. We do not admit that he who digs a race under a road and bridges it, thereby becomes liable to maintain the bridge. The digging of the race is a nuisance which the supervisors may abate, by either filling it up or bridging it. If the owner bridges it the nuisance ceases, although he might be indicted for the past offence until the limitation barred the prosecution.</p>

The law has intrusted the repairs upon the highways to others; and in Pennsylvania, the law does not deliver over the" care of highways and bridges in any case to individuals, but looks to the supervisors alone for the performance of that duty. In England, the liability to repair arises in three ways: 1. <em>Ratione tenuroe, Wool. </em>

The doctrine of enclosure has no application with us; and as to the encroachments, they would be simply nuisances. As to bridges the cases are numerous, but the result is that no individual is bound to repair except <em>ratione tenures, </em>or by prescription. In our state there is, properly speaking, no such thing as prescription: Young <em>v. </em>Collins, 2 <em>Bro. </em>293.

But our system of road laws differs so entirely from the English, that it would be no binding authority. The eases of Perley <em>v. </em>Chandler, and Dygert <em>v. </em>Schenck, although they recognise such a liability, differ from our case that there the question was as to the liability of the party who originally dug the race. There is therefore no direct authority upon the point; and upon principle it is against the whole spirit of our road laws, that the duty of keeping any part of our highways should be imposed upon or intrusted to individuals. When Stocker dug this race he committed a nuisance. The supervisors at that time might have filled it up. If they let him bridge it and took no covenant running with the land to repair, it was their own fault and neglect. When it became out of repair, the original digger might have been indicted, inasmuch as the nuisance would relate and be one continuous act, but his descendants and assigns in the third and fourth generation must be held guiltless.

We are also to assume that the bridges have heretofore been kept in repair by the former owners of the mill. From these facts an agreement to keep them in repair may be implied. A man who owns the soil on which the public have a highway has a right to enjoy his property in every way that may promote his interest or convenience, so that he takes care not to injure the public easement. <em>“Sic utere tuo ut alienum non Icedas,” </em>is the maxim which applies in such cases. He may cut a passage across the road for the purpose of draining his land, or leading water to his mill, because the land is his own and he may use it for all legitimate purposes. But, as he has no right to injure the public easement, he is bound, in order to preserve that right, not only to construct bridges over the ditches, where they cross the highways, but also to keep them in repair. The duty of keeping such bridges in repair is as imperative as the original obligation to construct them. He could not be permitted to cut the ditch without erecting the bridge. He is bound to keep the bridge in repair, “because he erected it for his own benefit.” <em>“Pur eeo que il ceo erect pur son benefit demesne:’’ </em>Bowbridge and Channel Bridge <em>v. </em>Le Prior de Stratford, 8 Ed. 2, cited in <em>Rolle’s Abr. </em>363, tit. <em>Bridges; </em>Perley <em>v. </em>Chandler, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Mass.%20454" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="6 Mass. 454">6 <em>Mass. Rep. </em>454</a>; Dygert <em>v. </em>Schenck, <a href="/citations/?q=23%20Wend.%20446" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="23 Wend. 446">23 <em>Wend. </em>446</a>. It follows from these principles that a subsequent owner of the land, who continues a watercourse across a highway, for the use of his mill, and thus renders a continuance of the bridge necessary, is liable for the repairs of the bridge. There was, therefore, error in giving judgment for the defendant on the point reserved.</p>

The Act of 13th June, 1836, sec. 68, expressly preserves the latter remedy, in addition to the other. But those proceedings are designed more as punishment for offences than remedies for the injuries caused by them. They do not therefore preclude the public from repairing the highway in the first place, and then bringing an action to recover the expenses of such repairs against the party who is liable for them. It is the duty of supervisors to keep the roads and township bridges <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>in repair. The public interest requires that this duty be promptly performed. The people are not to be obstructed in their right of passage until the termination of litigation with a wrongdoer. The obligation to keep the roads and bridges in repair gives the township a right of action against all persons whose neglect of duty has rendered the services of its supervisors in this respect necessary: Pottsville <em>v. </em>Norwegian Township, 2 <em>Harris </em>543. It is not necessary that the township should prove that the expense of the repairs was paid before suit brought. It is sufficient that the work has been done on the credit of the township. The defendant has nothing to do with the question whether the township has been able to pay its debts or not. A stranger, who is under no obligation to repair the bridges, could not recover from the defendant for expenses voluntarily incurred. The creditors of the township, for work done at the request of the supervisors, are strangers and volunteers, so far as regards the defendant below. They could maintain no action against him for these services. He may therefore feel perfectly safe in paying the just demand of the township.</p>
    <p id="b362-6" data-blocks='[["BL_362.4",362,[264,1243,1159,427]]]'>But it is supposed by the defendant in error that the form of the action, and the want of jurisdiction in the justice, present objections to the plaintiff’s recovery. It must be remembered that when the cause came into the Common Pleas, by appeal, the parties went to trial without objection, on a declaration for “ money had and received,” without any regard to the true nature of the action. Such a proceeding is a waiver of all objections either to the form of the action, or to the jurisdiction of the justice. It Í3 in the nature of an amicable action, with an agreement to waive all such questions, and to try the case on its merits.</p>
    <p id="b362-7" data-blocks='[["BL_362.5",362,[264,1671,1159,246]]]'>We perceive no reason why the plaintiff in error should not have judgment upon the verdict. But, as the defendant below may have grounds for a writ of error, we do not enter the final judgment against him here; but reverse the judgment for the defendant below, and remit the record for further proceedings according to law.</p>
