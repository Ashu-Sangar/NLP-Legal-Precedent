In all the other bequests made to Margaret Frank, except the one in dispute, he expressly states that she is to enjoy the same for her lifetime, and also that she and her sister Catharine Kendig are to be equal. If we therefore adopt the construction contended for by the counsel for the defendant, that he was a mere depositary of the $1500, and that as soon as the <em>corpus </em>of the legacy given in trust was paid out, the trust was at an end, that he was not required to keep it at interest for the use of the <em>cestui que </em>trust, such a construction, we think, would defeat the intention of the testator, because it would not make her equal with her sister, nor give her an interest for life in the same, which <a id="p478" href="#p478" data-label="478" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*478</a>appears to have been the design of the testator. It is true there is a clause in the item in which the $1500 are given in trust, from which an inference may be drawn in support of such a construction, but that clause appears so ambiguous, that we do not considér ourselves authorized, from any deductions which we can make from it, to disregard the well-established principle of law, which, on account of the universality of its application, has almost become an elementary principle, that trustees shall be accountable for interest, when the money is to remain in their hands for the benefit of another. In this case especially do we think there would be cause to hesitate, not only from the ambiguity of the clause relied upon, not only from the intention manifested by the testator in his will to provide for his daughter, but also from the condition and relative position of the parties to the testator. The object of the testator’s bounty was his daughter. To make a provision for her, as we conceive, not only during the vigour of her womanhood, but also to provide for her against the cold charities of the world in her old days, when overtaken by the infirmities of age. The will does not show that the legacy of $1500 was given to the defendant, as a recipient' of his bounty, but as guardian for <em>his </em>daughter; and to decide now that he is no longer accountable to her would be in violation, as we think, of the intention of the testator, as collected from the will.”</p>

He now tells us that the fund is exhausted, and the payments must cease. If this be the true construction of the will, the trustee, to whom no beneficial interest in the fund was given, will receive the principal advantage of it, and the daughter of the testator, for whose benefit it was chiefly designed, will be left to starve or to be supported by charity. There is not a word in the will which indicates the-thought that the trustee was in any <a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>event to derive any benefit whatever from the trust fund. On the contrary, the explicit declaration that it was given in trust excludes him from acquiring any interest in it, except such as is plainly given by the will. There is nothing whatever in the will which manifests an intention to relieve the trustee from the plain and obvious duty of investing the fund so as to make it productive. This duty the law imposes upon him without any direction in the will: Yundts’s Appeal, 1 <em>Harris </em>581; Baker <em>v. </em>Richards, 8 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>12; 12 <em>Harris </em>335; Lane’s Appeal, 12 <em>Harris </em>487; Light’s Appeal, 12 <em>Harris </em>180; Findley <em>v. </em>Smith, 7 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>268. He had no right to “hide the money in the earth,” or to “keep it laid up in a napkin.” The trustee in ancient times who hid the trust money in the earth, was condemned as “wicked and slothful,” and was very properly told that he ought to have put it to the exchangers, and then at the coming of the owner he should have received his “ own with <em>usury Matt. </em>xxv. 27.</p>
    <p id="b479-6" data-blocks='[["BL_479.4",479,[177,1106,1162,172]]]'>Mr. Breneman has either made profit out of the trust fund, or he has neglected his duty. In either case he is chargeable with interest. As he is entitled to compensation for performing his duty, the law holds him answerable for neglecting it.</p>
    <p id="b479-7" data-blocks='[["BL_479.5",479,[175,1277,1163,770]]]'>It is true that there is a provision in the will which looks to the possibility of the death of Margaret before she receives the money given in trust, and this is relied upon to prevent her from receiving .it in her lifetime, and to enable the trustee to keep it without interest. It will admit of no such construction. When we see the primary object of the testator, it is not to be defeated by an ambiguous clause like this. The intention may have been to provide for the loss of a portion of the fund without the fault of the trustee, or for its exhaustion for want of opportunity to make safe and profitable investments. Or the testator may have meant nothing more than that the arrearages of the annuity given to Margaret, which might remain unpaid at her death, should go, with the principal, to her heirs. Whatever may have been the intention of this clause, it is very clear that it does not manifest any purpose on the part of the testator to give the use of the fund to the trustee without interest, and thus enable him to deprive Margaret in her old age of the scanty provision intended to be continued to her during life.</p>
