The terms of the contract are as follows: — £We, whose names are hereunto subscribed, do promise to pay to the president and managers of the West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad Company the sum of $50 for every share of stock set opposite to our respective names, in such manner and proportions, and at such times, as shall be determined by the president and managers of the said company, in pursuance of an Act of the General Assembly of this Commonwealth, entitled An Act to authorize the Governor to incorporate the West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad Company. Provided, nevertheless, that the subscription hereto shall be binding only in the event of an aggregate of $300,000 being subscribed, inclusive of all former subscriptions and of such subscriptions as shall be made absolute or become so by the fulfilment of their conditions.’</p>

Among these which the court ruled out, will be found all those having special conditions to the number of 291 shares ; all those shares of stock which were given for land damages, 149 shares; those issued for work and materials, 445; those subscribed after instalments called in; those which have been released, and also those proved by John P. Jeffries, to amount of 518 shares. These, making an aggregate of 2105 shares, and being deducted from the amount exhibited, did not leave the amount required by the agreement. In the opinion of the court, these were not available funds, such as was required by the agreement of the parties; and the plaintiffs, failing on this point, cannot recover in this action, and your verdict must be for the defendant.</p>

This, it has been contended, extended not only to subscriptions taken before the commissioners, but also by the company after its organization. I consider this a sound objection to the recovery of the plaintiff. The terms of the Act of Assembly are peremptory, and the distinction made by the plaintiffs’ counsel between the commissioners and the company in regard to this point is, to my mind, without any sound reason. The decision in <em>Qasey, </em>referred to in the argument, does not rule this case. For both the foregoing reasons,' I lay it down to you that the plaintiffs have failed to sustain the action, and your verdict must be for the defendant.</p>

If the company called in these subscriptions before the sum of $300,000 were subscribed, they could neither compel the payment of the principal nor the interest, as the subscription was not binding, and the call not legal. With these observations the point may be generally affirmed.</p>

By that proviso it-was stipulated that <em>“ </em>the subscription hereto shall be binding only in the event of an aggregate of $300,000 being subscribed, inclusive of all former subscriptions, and of such subscriptions as shall be made absolute or shall become so by the fulfilment of their conditions.” To that contract Eber Hickman, the defendant below, subscribed to the number of ten shares, promising to pay $50 to each share, in such manner and proportions, and at such times as shall be determined by the president and managers of said company. This action is brought to recover the sums of money thus contracted to be paid.</p>
    <p id="b326-11" data-blocks='[["BL_326.11",326,[282,1538,1160,898]],["BL_327.1",327,[194,429,1160,1802]]]'>By the Act 11th April, 1848, entitled “ x\n Act authorizing the Governor to incorporate the West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad Company,” commissioners were appointed .to receive subscriptions to the stock according to the form prescribed in the act. That form contained no proviso of the kind contained in the contract of the defendant, and it was declared in the section authorizing the commissioners to receive subscriptions, that no subscription shall be valid unless the person so subscribing shall pay to the said commissioners at the time of making the same, the sum of $5 on each and every share, for the use of the company. It is very clear that the proviso applies exclusively to subscriptions received by the commissioners before the organization of the company. It is contained in the section specifying their powers and regulating their duties. It provides that the money shall be paid to the commissioners. But when 1200 shares of the stock were taken, and $5 on each share paid, the commissioners certified the fact to the governor, and letters patent issued according to the act of incorporation. A president and managers were elected, who were fully authorized by the charter to conduct the business of the company. They possessed the power to enter into any contract which was necessary to the purposes for which the corporation was created. <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>They had power not only to receive additional subscriptions to the extent of $600,000 capital created by the act, but to increase the capital to the extent of $1,200,000. The Act of Assembly placed no restriction upon the corporation, after it was organized, in regard to the payment of the sum of $5 on each share of stock at the time of subscribing. On the contrary, the president and managers were authorized and empowered to ascertain the terms, manner, and proportions in which the said stockholders shall pay the money due on their respective shares. The words “ the said stockholders,” must be intended to include all the stockholders referred to in the previous section. That section includes in the corporation not only the subscribers existing at the time letters patent issued, but if the subscription was not then full, those also “ who shall thereafter subscribe.” So that, under the Act of Assembly, the president and managers had full power to ascertain not only the “ time,” but the “ manner” of payment of all moneys due on stock subscribed before the organization, and of all moneys to become due on subscriptions subsequently taken. But, independently of that express authority conferred by the charter, the corporation, as an incident of its creation, has the power to make all contracts, whether express or implied, whether by bond, bill of exchange, or negotiable note, which are entered into in the usual and necessary course of its legitimate business, except where there is a statutory prohibition. This was expressly decided by this court, in the case of McMasters <em>v. </em>Reed’s Executors. In accordance with this principle, it was said by Mr. Justice Woodward, in The Erie and Waterford Plank Road Company <em>v. </em>Brown, 1 <em>Casey </em>156, that “ after the company is organized, it often happens that new subscriptions can be obtained only on new and peculiar terms. One subscriber must have time given him; another must be permitted to pay in labour or materials; a third must have the road located through his property in a particular manner ; and unless these conditions are complied with, the company cannot enlarge its stock, nor fulfil the object of its creation.” There is nothing in the charter of the corporation before us which prohibits it from taking subscriptions on such conditions as are here enumerated. As the preferred stock is not in question here, the provisions in relation to it have nothing to do with the case. The commissioners act under a special authority, which must be strictly construed. The president and managers act under the general corporate powers granted, and these must be so construed as to enable them to carry out the object of the charter.</p>

It also follows that the corporation had a right to accept payment of stock in labour or materials, in damages which the company were liable to pay, or in any other liability of the company, provided these transactions were entered into and carried out in good faith. There is no presumption in this case that they are otherwise.</p>

This power must be understood as within the contemplation of all persons when they become stockholders. All that is regarded is good faith in its exercise. '</p>
