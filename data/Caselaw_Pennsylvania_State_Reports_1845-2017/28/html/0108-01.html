The Act of Assembly was a public statute — the alley was to be a public highway, and every citizen of the Commonwealth will have an equal right to the free use and enjoyment of it. Some property owners may be injured by opening it, but this is no reason why the public authorities should be restrained by the courts from exercising their powers; and yet it would be as good ground for an injunction at the suit of a private complainant, as the incidental advantages anticipated by the relator are for the <em>mandamus </em>he wants. Be it that he has no other remedy, he has no right to the one he seeks, because he has no interest <a id="p114" href="#p114" data-label="114" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*114</a>that is specific — that is definite and peculiar to himself, and which is, at the same time, a legal cause of action. He has no more right to call on the municipal authorities to open an alley to put money into his pocket than he would have to require them to build him a house. The ground on which his action rests is his right of' passage — his right to enjoy the alley as an alley — and this right is not peculiar to him, but common to the whole town, and therefore a subject of public concernment.</p>
    <p id="AVR" data-blocks='[["BL_114.4",114,[313,736,1158,428]]]'>In Reading <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20196" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="1 Jones 196">1 <em>Jones </em>196</a>, <em>mandamus </em>was refused to private relators to remove obstructions from a street, and though the ground of the judgment was that there was remedy by indictment, it is apparent the court did not recognise any such interest in the relators as would entitle them to this writ. The nuisance in this ease, said the chief justice, is a public one, and it does not appear from the statement of the relators that they have received any special injury from it to entitle them to any civil remedy whatever. The obstruction of the sidewalk is not more injurious to them than it is to the inhabitants at large.</p>
    <p id="b114-6" data-blocks='[["BL_114.5",114,[315,1164,1160,555]]]'>The propriety of the rule which commits public affairs to public officers is apparent in this case. The legislature enacted that an alley should be opened in Pottsville, the location of which is described with a precision which indicates rather private dictation than legislative discretion. But the legislature committed the duty of opening it to a public municipal corporation, whom they had previously called into being and invested with large discretionary powers over the streets, roads, lanes, and alleys of the borough, and to whom was granted also a limited power of taxation. The town council allege that the borough is without means to open the alley, and that it will be useless when done; and they submit the borough surveyor’s report, showing that it must overcome an elevation of 75 feet in a distance of 230 feet, which is more than 16J degrees.</p>

The law was enacted for the public, and if the public acquiesce in its non-execution, the courts, who are only other agents of the public, have no duty or power in the premises. The law was not made for the relator, and confers on him no such rights as the courts can be called on to, guard, and therefore his complaint ought to have been dismissed at his costs.</p>
