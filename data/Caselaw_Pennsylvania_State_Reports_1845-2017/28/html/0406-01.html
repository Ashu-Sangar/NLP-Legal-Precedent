      <em>“ </em>There is no conflict of testimony in this case, and the counsel have submitted it to the court upon the foregoing evidence, to be considered a case stated for the opinion of the court, upon which judgment shall be entered, the question presented being one of law for the court to decide, and not a fact for a jury, and either party to take a writ of error without oath or bail. The town of Landisburg w'as laid out by Abraham Landis, the proprietor, in 1793. The lots were assigned to ticket holders by lottery. There were no blanks, but each holder of a ticket received the lot drawn against the number of his ticket. The holders paid <em>£3 </em>for a ticket, and in addition to the price paid for a ticket, each lot was to be subject to a yearly ground-rent of one dollar, and to be conveyed by the proprietor subject to said rent. Lot No. 13 was drawn by John Bigler and conveyed to him by Abraham Landis, by deed dated 9th November, 1807, for the consideration of ¿63. In the deed there is the following <em>clause: </em>— ‘ And it is further covenanted and agreed by the said John - Bigler for himself, his heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, to and with the said Abraham Landis, his heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns, that he or they will pay, or the said lot is subject to the payment of the yearly ground-rent of one dollar, valued at seven shillings and six pence.’ It is admitted that the defendant is in possession of this lot No. 13, by regular chain of title from John Bigler the alienee of Abraham Landis, and that the quit-rents are claimed and unpaid from 1841. The evidence shows that the plaintiff, by regular chain of title from Abraham Landis, is the owner of the quit-rents.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b409-7" data-blocks='[["BL_409.5",409,[175,763,1164,432]]]'>“ The present case is different. The lottery only decided the choice of lots, which we presume were of unequal value. The price of each ticket was ¿63, and every lot was subject to a ground-rent of one dollar per year. This reservation was retained in the real estate by Landis, the proprietor of the town, and' although he may have disposed of a part of his interest in the realty in an illegal manner, which would have prevented him from recovering the price to be paid for the interest conveyed, this could not affect the validity of his title to the estate or interest retained which he never agreed or intended to convey.</p>

But this attempt now to claim an interest which they never purchased, is virtually the same. That a ground-rent is real estate is decided in Cobb <em>v. </em>Biddle, 2 <em>Karris </em>445, Juvenal <em>v. </em>Patterson, 10 <em>Barr </em>283, and the other authorities there cited. The defendant too is without merit. The lot has doubtless passed through many intermediate hands from 1807 down to the present claimant with this reservation upon the face of the title. The rents it appears were paid till 1841, and there would be no equity in giving him what he never purchased, and what those from whom he derives his title never claimed.</p>

Whether this defence is sound as applied to the facts of. this case, is the subject of inquiry. The evils at which the Act of 1762 aimed, and properly, a deadly blow, were such as partook of a gambling character, then prevailing to an alarming extent, and most corrupting in their influences; when the chances were unequal, the schemes deceptive, and the innocent and unwary induced to embark; when they were doing little more than “sowing to the wind and reaping the whirlwind.” But it would, I think, be going too far to say that this act would have a proper application if applied to prevent several equal owners of land from determining by lot their respective shares.</p>

In Seidenbender <em>v. </em>Charles, 4 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>161, it was said that the purchasers of tickets in a lottery for lots laid out in a town were not <em>tenants </em>in <em>common '. </em>But the reason given was, that after the lottery was drawn, “ they took <em>very unequal parts, </em>designated by the chance of the wheel.” Yet Judge Tilghman there observes, “ when tenants in common make partition, they are seised of the whole estate before partition, and the object of the lot is, to assign to each his particular portion, the whole having been previously divided into parts as nearly as possible of <em>equal value.” </em>
      <a id="p412" href="#p412" data-label="412" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*412</a>In the present case, the tickets were paid for, the rights equal— nothing to show that the value of the ground was not equal to the price of the ticket — and the only office of the lottery was to assign to each his particular lot. The point decided in Seidenbender <em>v. </em>Charles was, that no action could he sustained for the <em>price of a ticket </em>in a lottery for the disposal of land. Had Bigler, after signing the agreement, refused to pay the price of the ticket, his defence under the Act of 1762 would undoubtedly have been good. But he chose to pay it, to take the deed, enter into possession, and carry the contract into effect; and now, with full notice of all this, his transferee, the present defendant, desires to go behind the deed to reach after an alleged illegal transaction, to enable him to enjoy his present possession without the payment of the stipulation contained in the only title he has to his ground. In the case last referred to, Judge Tilghman remarks, “ I am not giving an opinion on cases where the parties have thought proper to carry the contract into effect. The present question is, whether the purchaser of a ticket can be compelled to pay for it.”</p>

In Lestapies <em>v. </em>Ingraham, 5 <em>Barr </em>81-82, it is said, “that, while a court will not enforce an illegal contract, yet if the parties themselves execute it, and the illegal object has béen accomplished, the money or thing which was the price of it, may be a legal consideration between the parties for a promise express or implied, and the court will not unravel the transaction to discover its origin.”</p>

In case of intestacy it goes to the heir; it may pass by devise; and it may be conveyed by deed: Cobb <em>v. </em>Biddle, 2 <em>Harris </em>445, and 10 <em>Barr </em>282; 1 <em>Barr </em>399; <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20185" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 185">8 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>185</a>.
