D. 1856; having first made and published his last will and testament, which was duly admitted to probate on the 7th day of that month, and letters testamentary in due form of law were issued to the present plaintiffs; that by said last will and testament, after having specifically devised three properties particularly described to his three children, there is a power given to his executors in these words, <em>11 Item; </em>I hereby authorize and empower my executors, hereinafter named, to sell all the rest and residue of my real estate, or so much thereof as shall be neces<a id="p48" href="#p48" data-label="48" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*48</a>sary for that purpose, for the payment of my just debts; and I desire them to sell as speedily as they can, sufficient to get money to pay up in full my shares in various building associations, in said city, where they hold mortgages on my property, as by so doing, the said real estate will be released; and also in payment of a mortgage. I have given to a trustee for the use and benefit of my wife Plenrietta, on.her releasing he.r right of dower, of and in all my estate, whether real or personal, as I desire the mortgages on the property given to each of my said three children, to be paid off as speedily as possible, and therefore appropriate all my other property not before specifically devised for the payment of my debts, but hereby giving unto my said executors, power to sell and convey any of the real estate, if necessary, for the payment of my debts and funeral expenses.” And it is agreed, as part of the facts in this case, that the said property at the corner of Laurel and Budd streets, above mentioned, is a part of the <em>rest </em>and <em>residue </em>of the real estate, and not any which was specifically devised ; that the said executors caused this with other properties which belonged to said testator to be advertised for sale at public auction, by M. Thomas &amp; Sons, at the Philadelphia Exchange, on the 1st day of April, 1856; when the property above described was sold to John Kurtz, the defendant, for the sum of $800 (subject to a yearly ground-rent of $34), and that said John Kurtz paid on his bid $50, in cash, and signed the conditions of sale, which were that the terms were cash, to be paid in ten days from the sale. That immediately after the said sale, the title papers to said property were furnished to the counsel of the defendant, who pronounced the chain of title good. That by the mutual understanding between the parties, there was some delay in getting the title papers prepared, and in procuring the searches in order to make it complete, but on the 16th day of July, 1856, the said executors tendered to the said defendant a good and sufficient deed for the premises.</p>

It is also well settled that a sale of real estate under a testamentary power to sell for the purpose of paying debts, discharges the estate in the hands of the purchaser from the general or unscheduled debts of the testator. ,</p>

Such a sale is in no respect a judicial one. It is in virtue solely of a private power ; and although the purchaser may pay the purchase-money into the Orphans’ Court having jurisdiction over the accounts of the executor, yet his doing so will only protect him against “ all persons having or who may have an interest therein.” This provision does not help the plaintiff in error, for unless the lien of a judgment is discharged by the sale, the judgment-creditor has no interest in the proceeds of sale, and consequently the purchaser is not, by the payment of the purchase-money into the Orphans’ Court, protected against the claim of the judgment-creditor. The construction given by Mr. Justice Bell to the 19th section of the Act of 1834 in Cadbury <em>v. </em>Duval, is doubtless the correct one ; that it applies only to scheduled debts, which the purchaser being bound to notice, might be required to see that the purchase-money was applied to. To relieve him from this difficulty, he was authorized by the act aforesaid to pay the purchase-money into the Orphans’ Court, where the rights of the creditors would be protected by a proper and legal distribution of the fund. We think the question in the case at bar is free from difficulty. The lien of a judgment <a id="p51" href="#p51" data-label="51" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*51</a>obtained against the real estate of a decedent in his lifetime, can only be discharged by payment or by a judicial sale of such real estate. An executor’s sale under a testamentary power is not a judicial sale, and does not divest the lien of a judgment which ha'd attached anterior to the testator’s death.</p>
