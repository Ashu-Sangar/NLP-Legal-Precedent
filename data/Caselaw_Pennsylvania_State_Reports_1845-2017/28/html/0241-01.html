Whilst these dealings were taking place, Ruch gave to Fricke a check on the Tradesmen’s Bank, dated 5th March, 1855, and a large number of his promissory notes to the order of the plaintiffs. There was no evidence to show that the check had been presented for payment, but it appeared that at the time the check was dated, and for twenty-six days afterwards, Ruch had not sufficient funds to meet it. Some of the notes which had passed between the parties were in the possession of Ruch, and were offered on the trial as a set-off against Fricke’s claim. His pass-book showed that he had been credited with certain of the notes which he had given to Fricke.</p>

It was contended on the part of Ruch, and there was some evidence to show, that he had so little knowledge of English as to be unable to read the entries in the pass-book. There was also some evidence, which was disregarded by the jury, that Ruch had been overcharged for articles sold him by Fricke.</p>

      <em>“ </em>The plaintiff in this case relied in the first instance on his own book of original entries, as well as on the defendant’s passbook; but in order to obviate the objections which have been taken to his entries, he now limits himself solely to the defendant’s book; you will therefore not rely on the plaintiff’s book as proof of the entries which it contains, and will look at it only so far as it corroborates or contradicts the statements made by the defendant’s witness with regard to the plaintiffs’ charges. Entries in a pass-book, coming from the possession of a purchaser, are evidence of an express or implied agreement to purchase at the price named in the pass-book. When the parties agree expressly or by implication on price, they are bound by it, and cannot complain that it is too high, unless on the ground of fraud; and hence, while systematic effort to overcharge, such as one of the witnesses has stated, may amount to fraud if the jury give credit to his testimony: the mere fact of an overcharge, or of a charge above what are said to be current or market rates, is but slight evidence that fraud has been committed; although such as it is I leave it to the jury.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b242-13" data-blocks='[["BL_242.11",242,[332,2286,1158,170]],["BL_243.1",243,[156,433,1167,1288]]]'>“ In opposition to the defendant’s evidence on this point, stands the defendant’s pass-book, which shows a long course of dealing between him and the plaintiffs, and stated accounts at successive intervals. The statement of an account need not be by a meeting <a id="p243" href="#p243" data-label="243" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*243</a>between the parties for the purpose of settlement, but may equally well grow out of a statement by one party placed in the hands of the other, and acquiesced in and acted upon by him, as in this case such statements are ratified by carrying the balance struck in accounts repeatedly to others during a series of years, in a book which, like a pass-book, comes from and goes back into the hands of the party who seeks to impeach them, they are entitled to great weight, and should be held conclusive unless he can prove fraud or mistake, and not only allege the existence of error, but puts his finger upon it and establishes its existence. In this instance it is said that the defendant cannot read English; if so, it is a circumstance for the consideration of a jury, but a circumstance which would be entitled to more weight if the dispute arose out of a single transaction, or the execution of a particular instrument," instead of in the course of a business extending through many years, and affording ample opportunity for inquiry or examination. It is proved that the defendant could read figures, so that they must have informed him as to price. He knew what he had bought and used in his business, so that he need not have been in the dark with regard to kind and quality, if the plaintiffs charged more than he had agreed, or was willing to give, a comparison of one of these elements with the other would have enabled him to detect the error. Besides, if the defendant consented, expressly or impliedly, that the account should be kept in a language with which he was imperfectly acquainted, he ought, in justice to himself and the plaintiff, to have asked some one to interpret what he did not understand. The evidence of overpayment, and in support of the set-off claimed by the defendant, consists in the notes given before the bulk of the debt which the plaintiff originated.</p>

I say under the third point, that a note made and delivered by one man to another, and taken up by the maker is evidence of payment by the maker to the payee, but is not evidence of a debt due by the payee to the maker, nor of a set-off against the payee. I say on the first point, that the <a id="p244" href="#p244" data-label="244" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*244</a>law imposes no restrictions on pass-books, and one entry is as proper in such a book as another.
