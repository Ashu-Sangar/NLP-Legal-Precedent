If this be so, a devise to children to take distributively, is a valid definition of lineal descent, and therefore of entailment. Then the rule would apply that an estate granted to one for life with remainder to his lineal heirs, is an estate tail; the superadded words “ and their heirs” go for nothing. They were necessary under the English law, when children took by purchase, and not as heirs of the body, else they would have had but a life estate. Here they are heirs of the body when taking equally, and we should have little difficulty in regarding this as an estate tail, were it not that the two limitations are altogether a devise to the general heirs of the first taker. Children being as good a word of lineal descent, is equivalent to issue, and this devise may be put into the wery language most usual in creating an estate tail — thus—devise to A. for life, remainder to his issue, and in default of issue over.</p>
