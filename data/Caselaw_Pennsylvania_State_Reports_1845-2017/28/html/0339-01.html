Without reference to the validity of the transfer, which will be noticed hereafter, the defendant was a member of the corporation, and had the opportunity of attending the meetings of the stockholders, and of giving his Voice in favour or against any measure proposed at such meeting] and if a majority decided against his views of propriety, or if h^ voluntarily stayed away from such meetings, he can have no causg of complaint. I cannot therefore assent to the fourth point'ipade by the defendant, ‘that the plaintiff cannot recover in thiskaction, for that since the defendant became a subscriber to the;-stock of the West Chester and Philadelphia, Railroad Company\'’.the charter of the company has by virtue of an Act of the legislature duly accepted by the company, undergone a material alteration, and no evidence has been given showing that the defendant has assented.’ This I cannot affirm. While I should claim in a c.ase beyond doubt the right to declare a law of the legislature unconstitutional, yet in this case, with the hurry of a trial of court, it is impossible to give the point such examination as it would seem to deserve. I would prefer to say, if the defendant be a member of the company, and liable as such to the corporation, he has had the same notices of meetings as others, and if he be not a member and not liable, there was no necessity whatever to give him notice of meetings to accept or refuse the supplements to the charter.. I will therefore affirm the eighth and ninth points of the plaintiff, that ‘ The Acts of Assembly supplemental to the original act of incorporation having been regularly accepted by the company at meetings regularly convened for that purpose, are to be regarded as part of its charter and binding on the corporators. There is no such change effected in the original act of incorporation or charter, by the said supplements or any of them, as affects the liability of the defendant as an original subscriber to the stock of the company, or operates to discharge him from such liability.’ Still, the most'important questions to my mind are yet to be considered. And before touching them, it seems necessary that I should say a word to you on matters which have been unnecessarily referred to in the course of the argument. It can make no difference to you or to me, who <a id="p347" href="#p347" data-label="347" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*347</a>are the parties to this suit. Their rights are the same as the most obscure individual, no more, no less. The advantages or disadvantages of the proposed improvement to the public or to individuals ; the motives of the commissioners, or of the stockholders: whether these shall lose or gain by the undertaking; none of these considerations should interfere with the determination of the case you are trying. Like all other actions tried in a court of justice, the case should be determined by the law and the evidence applicable to the circumstances involved.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b347-6" data-blocks='[["BL_347.4",347,[174,800,1166,1031]]]'>“ You cannot fail to have noticed where the parties stand. The plaintiff upon the contract entered into by the defendant on the 19th of June, 1848, and August, 1850; the defendant upon the transfer of the 100 shares of stock to John T. Everhart on the 26th of January, 1852. It is an undoubted fact, that the defendant subscribed for 100 shares of stock of the West Chester and Philadelphia Railroad Company. It is equally true that by this subscription, he made himself liable to the payment of $50 for every share which he had subscribed, at such times, in such proportions and manner, as should be determined by the president and managers of the said company. It is also true that the liability of the defendant continued up to the date of the transfer on the 26th of January, 1852. Was it then shifted from himself to John T. Everhart? It is undoubted that William Everhart, <em>with the consent </em>of the company, could transfer his shares to another, in a way to absolve himself from all further liability on account of the shares of stock which he had subscribed. The parties to the contract could rescind it. To my mind he could not do so <em>without the consent </em>of the company. In this I feel myself sustained by reason, as well as by authority. Upon his name being subscribed by himself to the agreement I have referred to, he became bound by that agreement to fulfil his engagement, along with the rest of the subscribers, and the contract could not to be rescinded without the concurrent consent of both parties.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b348-6" data-blocks='[["BL_348.4",348,[269,506,1167,674]]]'>“ But I cannot consent to affirm the proposition of the plaintiff, <em>‘ </em>that the defendant had no property in the shares of stock purchased by him, which could be made the subject of sale and transfer, beyond the value of the first instalment paid by him at the time of subscribing.’ I think this point is not well considered and it is disaffirmed. I have said that William Everhart, with the consent of the company, could transfer his shares to another, and in this connexion I will answer the first proposition of the defendant. ‘ When an original subscriber to the stock of an incorporated company, who is bound to pay the instalments on his subscription, as they are called in by the company, transfers his stock to another person,’ with the consent of the company, such other person is substituted, not only to the rights but to the obligations of the original subscriber, and the liability to pay up the instalments is shifted from the outgoing to the incoming stockholder.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b348-7" data-blocks='[["BL_348.5",348,[266,1192,1164,682]]]'>“ This right of transfer is clearly recognised in the seventh section of the original act of incorporation, which declares * that the said president and managers first chosen, shall procure certificates or evidence of stock for all the shares of said company, and shall deliver one or more certificates, signed by the president and countersigned by the treasurer, and sealed with the common seal of the corporation, to each person for the number of shares by him or her subscribed or held, which certificate or evidence of stock shall be transferable at his or her pleasure, in person or by attorney duly authorized, in the presence of the president or treasurer, one of whom shall keep a book for that purpose, subject however to all payments due or to become due thereon.’ It does not, and it cannot, however, absolve the original subscriber, who is in privity with the company on his contract, from the liability to pay the instalments <em>‘ </em>due or to become due’ upon his shares, unless the consent of the company be first obtained.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b348-8" data-blocks='[["BL_348.6",348,[265,1874,1164,556]],["BL_349.1",349,[160,420,1170,1631]]]'>“ It will be seen from the foregoing, that while the original subscriber cannot absolve himself from his liability without the consent of the company; yet the company is bound also, by the nature of the agreement, to favour the application for a transfer, made by a subscriber, by keeping books of transfer to be used for that purpose. An application for a transfer of stock cannot be arbitrarily refused by the officers of the company. They are as much bound to perform' their corporate duties, as are subscribers to stock. Neglect on their part to furnish certificates or evidence of stock, or to obtain books of transfer, cannot prevent a transfer from being made, all other things being legitimate and in order. A transfer made in the manner pursued by the defendant, notwithstanding there were no certificates of stock or books procured, <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>would be complete and binding without them, if the consent of the company were obtained. Was it procured, or was it arbitrarily withheld ? In either case, in the opinion of the court, the defendant would be absolved, and the plaintiff' cannot recover. It seems quite clear from the evidence in the cause, that the consent of the company was not obtained. The question then is, was it withheld improperly, or was the attempt on the part of Mr. Everhart a scheme to rid himself of his liability to the injury and loss of the company ? If the latter, the officers had the right to withhold their assent to the transfer, nay, their duty to the other stockholders forming the company, required of them to prevent the transfer, and their conduct was meritorious rather than otherwise. You will see, therefore, that the question is one for your consideration and is confined to a narrow compass. Was the transfer made to John T. Everhart, by the defendant, a <em>bona fide transfer, a fair, honest </em>transaction, or one <em>to shield himself from, what he apprehended </em>was about to be a losing concern ? If it were so intended, the transfer did not receive the assent of the company for sound reasons, the officers were in the performance of their corporate duties, the transfer fails of its purpose, and the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict. The evidence to the point here made you will collect from the entire transaction. If you should come to the conclusion that the <em>transfer was a legitimate transaction </em>between the defendant and his nephew, then the transfer cannot be defeated by the want of books or certificates, and the verdict should be for the defendant; but if on the contrary you should be satisfied by the evidence in the cause, that the <em>transfer was not a bona fide transaction, </em>but was made by the defendant to <em>rid himself of his obligation </em>to the company, then the assent of the company was wanting, the transfer is inoperative, and the plaintiff should receive your verdict. The points not specifically answered are sufficiently noticed in the general charge. I cannot say there is <em>no evidence of fraud </em>for the consideration — there is <em>evidence </em>which the jury will be called on to examine in relation to this point. Should you <em>find for the plaintiff, </em>it will be your duty to find according to the principle of the contract as specified in the statement submitted — subject to such corrections as it may require.”</p>

    <p id="b351-12" data-blocks='[["BL_351.13",351,[179,2214,1163,130]]]'>The first of these supplemental acts, passed the 7th January, 1853, authorized the stockholders to elect three additional managers.</p>

    <p id="b352-5" data-blocks='[["BL_352.4",352,[271,502,1164,547]]]'>The last act, passed the 30th March, 1855, authorized the company, “ for the purpose of completing and equipping their said railroad,” to create a preferred stock to the extent of eight thousand shares of fifty dollars each, and for the purpose of redeeming its bonds and the preferred stock, and for the payment of other debts, to issue and dispose of bonds to any amount not exceeding six hundred thousand dollars, at a rate of interest not exceeding 8 per cent, per annum. Besides providing for many details connected with the preferred stock, the act stipulates that before it takes effect as a law of the corporation, it shall be accepted by a majority in value of the stockholders entitled to vote, and prescribes how the meeting of the stockholders shall be convened.</p>

    <p id="b352-7" data-blocks='[["BL_352.6",352,[266,1143,1163,644]]]'>Now it is too plain for controversy that this legislation was in aid of the objects and purposes of the corporation, which were in general to build and work a railroad from the borough of West Chester to the city of Philadelphia. The company was incorporated in pursuance of an Act of Assembly passed in 1848 — they had organized and commenced their work — and the preamble to the Act of 1855 recites that they would require, to complete and equip their road, a greater sum than could be realized by the sale of bonds and stock now authorized by law, and that the making of a floating debt to meet such requirements would be onerous to the management of the road, and in all probability unduly hazard the interests of holders of its capital stock. Out of these embarrassments grew the remedial legislation 'that was accepted by the company, but which is now set up by one of the original corporators as a defence against his payment of stock.</p>

Every individual owner of shares expects, and indeed stipulates with the other owners as a body corporate, to pay them his proportion of the expense which a majority may please to incur in the promotion of the particular objects of the corporation. By acquiring an interest in the corporation, therefore, he enters into an obligation with it in the nature of a special contract, the terms of which are limited by the specific provisions, rights, and liabilities detailed in the act of incorporation. To make a valid change in this private <a id="p353" href="#p353" data-label="353" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*353</a>contract, as in any other, the assent of both parties is indispensable. The corporation on one part can assent by a vote of the majority, the individual on the' other part by his own personal act. Consequently, where an assessment is sued for to advance objects essentially different, or the same objects in methods essentially different from those originally contemplated, they cannot be recovered because they are not made in conformity to the defendant’s special contract with the corporation: <em>Angell &amp; Ames on Cor., </em>§ 537; Union Lock &amp; Canal Company <em>v. </em>Towne, 1 <em>N.

    <p id="b353-6" data-blocks='[["BL_353.4",353,[151,935,1162,459]]]'>Whilst these principles are unquestionable, it is equally well settled by the authorities that modifications and improvements in the charter, useful to the public, and beneficial to the company, and in accordance with what was the understanding of the subscribers as to the real object to be effected, do not impair the contract of subscription: Irvin <em>v. </em>Turnpike Company, 2 <em>Penn.

The case of the Indiana Turnpike <em>v. </em>Phillips, 2 <em>Penn. R. </em>184, is an instance of such radical alteration in the structure of the company as works a release of the subscriber.</p>
    <p id="b353-7" data-blocks='[["BL_353.5",353,[146,1405,1166,848]]]'>These general principles are founded in common sense, and it is apparent that they afford not the least support to this defence. The defendant voluntarily embarked in an enterprise which could only be carried out by accumulating large sums of money. His special contract with the other corporators looked to nothing less than a finished railroad from West Chester to Philadelphia; and it implied necessarily the ordinary and lawful means for accomplishing that object. When their money was expended and the work not finished, the necessary funds could be raised only by giving these funds a preference over the original stock, whether they came in the form of a loan or of preferred stock. Without the remedies provided by the legislature, the defendant’s stock must remain worthless on his hands — with them, he shared a common chance with the others of realizing ultimate profits. The legislation then, without altering the structure of the company, or changing the objects of its institution, or the mode in which those objects were to be pursued, set on foot a scheme of finance intended for its relief and benefit. It was to complete and equip the road — the very road — the defendant had agreed to assist to build.</p>

One of our number is of opinion that if the assignment had been <em>bona fide </em>it would have relieved him from further liability, but that the record showing that it was a transfer <em>mala fide, </em>he remains liable. The only remaining judge who sat in the argument holds that the assignment was valid and relieved the defendant from further liability.</p>

It is very clear that the transfer was not made in the ordinary course, as a business transaction, because the alleged purchaser was really paid for taking the stock, instead of paying money for it. Yet that is immaterial, because, whether the transfer was fair or fraudulent— whether with the consent of the company or without it — whether entered on the books or not — whether the purchaser became liable for the instalments unpaid or not, there is nothing in the law, or in the nature of the transaction, which discharges the original subscriber from his express written engagement to pay the money: Trevor <em>v. </em>Perkins, <a href="/whart/5/0244-01" class="citation" data-index="42" data-cite="5 Whart. 244" data-case-ids="8877698" data-case-paths="/whart/5/0244-01">5 <em>Wharton </em>244</a>.

He is therefore not liable for the penalty. It is true that there is no assignment which brings this error to our notice in such a way as to oblige us to take notice of it. But the declaration claims the “ one per cent, per month,” and the amount of the verdict shows that it was recovered.</p>

If my brethren do not concur in this suggestion, I must unite with them in saying that the errors have not been sustained, and that the judgment must be affirmed.</p>
