    <p class="summary" id="b172-8" data-blocks='[["BL_172.7",172,[266,898,1167,636]]]'>This was an action on the case <em>sur assumpsit, </em>by William Ellsbre against Manson Ellsbre. The affidavit of the plaintiff was filed, deposing, to his belief, that the debt due exceeded one hundred dollars. On the 29th May, 1855, an award of arbitrators was filed in the case, finding $21.73 in favour of the plaintiff, and on the 8th of June, 1855, the defendant filed the plaintiff’s receipt, acknowledging satisfaction in full, for debt, interest, and costs. On the 9th August, 1855, on motion, judgment was entered, absolute, against defendant for costs, and a <em>fieri facias </em>issued for the attorney’s fee, the sheriff’s and prothonotary’s fees, amounting to $20.79. On the 11th September, 1855, on motion of the defendant, the court below granted a rule on the plaintiff to show cause why the <em>fi. fa. </em>should not be set aside, and the judgment be stricken off; and on the 18th of the same month this rule was made absolute.</p>

Before the award had ripened into a judgment by the expiration of the twenty days allowed for an appeal, the plaintiff gave to the defendant a receipt in full of debt, interest, and costs, which was filed of record by the defendant. Did this receipt prevent the collection of the officers’ fees, by execution issued after the twenty days expired? We think not. The plaintiff had no right to receive the officers’ fees from the defendant, and the legal effect of the receipt was limited to, the debt, interest, and such costs as belonged to the plaintiff'. This left the award unsatisfied in part, and when no appeal was taken within the time allowed by law, the judgment became absolute that the defendant should pay to the officers their fees.
