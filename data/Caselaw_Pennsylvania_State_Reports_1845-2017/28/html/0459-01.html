Notice to one of several executors is sufficient: <em>chitty on Bills </em>449. The will had been proved, and Henry M. Watts and John H. Shoenberger had not joined in the probate or qualified as executors. The executors who prove the will are the actual representatives,; those who do not join have no authority to meddle with the estate: 1 <em>Wm. on Fx. </em>236; Rawlinson <em>v. </em>Shaw, 3 <em>T.

At death a man’s estate really passes into the hands of the law for administration, as much when he dies testate as when,intestate; except that, in the former case, he fixes the law of its distribution after payment of debts, and usually appoints the persons who are to execute his will. But even this appointment is only provisional, and requires to be approved by the law before it is complete; and therefore the title to the office of executor is derived rather from the law than from the will.</p>
    <p id="b466-4" data-blocks='[["BL_466.4",466,[289,844,1162,344]]]'>The law, however, allows a man to appoint his executors subject to this approval, and treats them, when appointed, as entitled to the office until they renounce it, if they are not legally incompetent to fill it. If they are competent, their appointment avails to make them representatives of the estate so far as relates to acts in which they are merely passive, such as receiving notice of the dishonour of a note; for they have immediate power to qualify themselves to act if they choose, and if the occasion demands it.</p>

The law allowed the testator to appoint them, and he did so, and they may be treated as representing his estate for the purpose of such notice, unless they renounce at the register’s office, or at least until they refuse the notice on the ground that they do not intend to serve. He who is bound to give such notice, is not in fault in giving it to one who is thus potentially an executor, even though others have already become so actually, by taking the oath of office, unless at least he is warned that such notice is not accepted. If the estate suffers from such a notice, it is not the fault of him that gave it.</p>
