In making that order, however, the court did not look into the plaintiff’s title, and of course did not prejudge the question, whether the title of Hannah Raymond could be made use of in this case. Nothing is better settled than that, whatever be the interest of the defendant, whether it be a term for years or a fee, passes by the sale; and in an ejectment by the sheriff’s vendee, against the original defendant, he cannot set up an outstanding title in a third person: Young <em>v. </em>Algeo, <a href="/watts/3/0223-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts 223" data-case-ids="1841300" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0223-01">3 <em>Watts </em>223</a>.
