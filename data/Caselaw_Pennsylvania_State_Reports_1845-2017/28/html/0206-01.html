The two causes were tried before the same jury in the court below, and the same question arose in each, except that the plaintiff in this case, it was alleged, had a spring on his land, which was situated below high-water mark on the Lehigh river. The defendants alleged that he could claim no damage for the loss of this spring, inasmuch as the right to the soil, to high-water mark, was in the Commonwealth.</p>

    <p id="b207-10" data-blocks='[["BL_207.10",207,[154,957,1168,599]]]'>The plaintiff below claims for the loss of a spring on his land by means of the company’s works, and it is objected that no damage can be allowed for this, since the spring is below high-water mark. We do not think the cases cited sustain the objection. The owner of land adjoining a navigable river owns to low-water mark, subject to the public right of navigation to high-water mark, as it exists naturally, and such ownership gives him title to such a spring as this, subject only to this public right. This suit is to ascertain “ what damages have been sustained by the owner,” and when this purpose is not restrained by other language or by special considerations, we presume it to be intended to cover everything that would be an injury at common law: <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Rawle%2023" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Rawle 23">4 <em>Rawle </em>23</a>; 19 <em>State Rep. </em>16; 5 <em>Eng.
