The action is <em>assumpsit, </em>the plea <em>non assumpsit, </em>and the defendants wore both summoned as partners, according to the return of the sheriff. The appearance of counsel for the defendants is general. Under a notice served on them by the plaintiff, the defendants produce upon the trial a book kept by them, and containing a memorandum of agreements with different persons, and among others an agreement between plaintiff and defendants for coaling a certain quantity of wood. The defendants’ clerk was called as a witness, who identified the book, as being the book of agreements, and proved the signature of Balliett &amp; Hallman. Upon his cross-examination he said the signature was made by John Balliett, and was in his handwriting. The agreement is a mere memorandum not under seal, and such an agreement a partner might sign with the name of the firm. The agreement being produced under notice and the signature thus proven was admitted in evidence. After some further evidence had been given in relation thereto, the parties agreed to admit on the one side, that the plaintiff had coaled 1399 cords of wood for defendants, and on the other side, that the sum of $325.85 had been paid plaintiff by defendants. (See paper filed.) This left open the question as to the manner in which the wood had been coaled. The defendant alleges that he was damaged by its being done in an unskilful manner, and not according to the agreement. Under the evidence the question was submitted to the jury with the instructions, that if they were satisfied that the wood ha,d been coaled in so unskilful a manner, as to entitle the plaintiff to no more than he had already received, then the verdict should be for the defendants; that he was bound to perform the contract in a skilful and workmanlike manner, and that if he had failed to do so, and thereby damaged the defendant to a greater amount than the sum remaining unpaid, he could not recover. If such was not the case, they might find for the plaintiff whatever amount in their opinion he should have in addition to the amount already received. The plaintiff claims a balance of $121.83.</p>

      <em>“ </em>The question was reserved with the consent of the parties, because there was no evidence of the partnership outside of the record and papers in the case, which in any event would have been for the construction of the court. It is contended that to enable the plaintiff to recover, he should have proven on the trial that a partnership existed between the defendants, and that they were known and reputed as a firm, and done business as such. Certainly it was necessary that a joint liability appear from the evidence. We are not prepared to say there was no such evidence. The defendants were sued as partners, named as such upon the record, and in the pleadings the attorneys appear for them as such, and without objection the trial was gone through with. An admission was made of the amount of work done and payments made between the parties. An agreement held by themselves and drawn from their possession by a notice by the adverse party, signed by the name of the firm, and proven by their own clerk, is certainly some evidence. They signed the contract with the name of the firm on which the suit was brought. John Balliett was present at the trial and sitting by the side of counsel. Jesse Hall-man, if improperly joined as a defendant, might have taken advantage of it, either in the pleadings or upon the trial, but did not do so. If he is not jointly liable he does not complain, so far as we have heard.</p>

We think the defendants, if the objections would have served them, should have taken advantage of it on the trial, and not having done so, it will not avail them now against the evidence of their written contract.

Jacob Fink never denied his signature; on the contrary, he was asserting that the agreement was the one made by the parties, and called upon the defendants, in whose possession it was, to bring it forward.

The sufficiency of the evidence to establish a joint liability was for the jury; and, as the parties, by consent, referred the question to the court, I am by no means certain that the decision of the court is reviewable on error. But, as our opinion in this case <a id="p271" href="#p271" data-label="271" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*271</a>coincides with that of the Common Pleas, it becomes unnecessary to determine whether we would reverse the. judgment, if it were otherwise.</p>
