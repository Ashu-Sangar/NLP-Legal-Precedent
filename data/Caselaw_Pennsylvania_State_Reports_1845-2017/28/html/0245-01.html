      <a id="p246" href="#p246" data-label="246" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*246</a>This was an action of replevin brought by Dewit C. Morris against Joseph Ruch and Charles Gallen, to recover two carriages and two horses. The sheriff’s return to the writ of replevin was, “ Replevied and summoned as commanded. Property bond entered and property delivered to defendant.” The declaration averred that the defendants, on the 12th day of July, 1854, <em>“ </em>took the goods and chattels of him, the said plaintiff, to wit: two carriages and two horses, of the value of seven hundred dollars, and the same unjustly detained against gages and pledges, until, &amp;c., and still doth detain,” &amp;c.</p>

The plaintiff joined in the demurrer. The District Court rendered judgment for the plaintiff upon the same. A writ of inquiry of damages was sued out by the plaintiff, and the jury assessed the damages at $350. This assessment was set aside by the court at the instance of the plaintiff, and an <em>alias </em>writ of inquiry issued, upon which the damages were assessed at $1250.</p>

Citing <em>Carth. </em>218; but this is an incorrect citation; none can be found in that book. And, <em>Id. </em>171, where the form of the inventory is given, it is not more particular than this declaration.

A declaration in replevin must be certain to a general intent, and the reason of the rule is that the sheriff may know, with reasonable certainty, when a <em>retorno habendo </em>comes to be executed, what he is to deliver, though he is entitled upon such a writ to have the assistance of the defendant to point out the goods. But where the defendant interposes a claim property bond and keeps the goods, he has not only individuated them, but he has no reason for objécting to indefiniteness of description. Whatever may be the result of the suit it can give him no writ, to the due execution of which a more minute description would be necessary. He has got the specific property, and minuteness of description thenceforth is important only to the plaintiff, and not to him. If therefore the declaration were faulty in the particular alleged, the defendant is not in position to take advantage of it, but an examination of the authorities cited in the argument, will satisfy any mind that there is no fault in the declaration; I will not go into the authorities, for the case does not require it.
