While it was there, Dripps, the present plaintiff, believing it belonged to him as the legal owner of the real estate, obtained a writ of replevin, which he placed in the hands of the sheriff, and the property in the writ mentioned was replevied. It was taken out of the hands of Mr. Christian and placed in the hands of Dripps, he having entered into bond to return the property or its value, if it should be determined not to belong to him. Mr. Christian, had he given bond to the same effect, could have held the property; but refusing, or failing to do so, it was handed over to Mr. Dripps. It is for you to say to whom that property belonged at the time it was taken, and the value thereof, and this is the question you are now called on to determine. Should you come to the conclusion that the property replevied belonged to Mr. Dripps, you will find for the plaintiff, with such damages as you may consider just for the taking and detention by the defendant ; but anything excessive would, in the opinion of the court, be improper, inasmuch as it seems to be a question simply to try the right. Should you, on the contrary, find for the defendant, Mr. Christian, it will be your duty to find the value of the goods taken, at the time they were taken by the plaintiff, together with interest in the shape of damages on the value found, from the taking to the present time.</p>

From the hasty examination I have been enabled to bestow on these questions during their argument, I may run into an error; but if so, it is a matter of pleasure to know that the decision I here give will be rectified by the Supreme Court of the state. It cannot be concealed that whether Mr. Christian went into the firm as part owner of the real estate or not, is a question not without doubt. After such deliberation as I have been enabled to give the subject, I have come to the conclusion that he did. The book containing the agreement, the statement of liabilities and resources, and the amount of stock brought in by him, have brought me to this conclusion. The evidence upon this point is for the jury, and if believed by you, it will in law constitute the defendant part owner of the real estate. This determination <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>will, it seems to me, dispose of the first and second points of the defendant, as the alternative whereon they are predicated is not admitted. Another question arising in the cause is, whether the three lathes in controversy were attached to the freehold, and became a part of the real estate. No case in the hooks presents a parallel condition of things. Indeed, it is well said by a judge of the Supreme Court of the state of New York, ‘that neither the elementary writers, nor the reported cases, furnish any precise or certain rule to determine what a fixture is.’ Each case must depend on its own peculiar circumstances. In the case we are called on to determine, I am of opinion, that if the jury believe the evidence, the three lathes in dispute were attached to the freehold and became part of the real estate.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b275-6" data-blocks='[["BL_275.4",275,[190,968,1166,944]]]'>“ It cannot be disputed that the legal title to the real estate remained in William Dripps, the vendor, notwithstanding his sale of the premises to Bisbing &amp; Burn, and he had a right at law to its possession upon default having been made by the vendees in any of their payments under their articles. Here, while the article required the payment of $2000 annually on the 1st day of April, together with interest on the sum remaining unpaid, no money was paid to Dripps after the 1st day of April, 1853. Such default having been made, the vendees, although in the actual possession, had no right to sever the said lathes from the freehold. The evidence is not disputed that Christian removed these lathes on the 9th of March, 1855, from the foundry, under the circumstances detailed, but such severance did not make them Christian’s; for although they thereby became personal property, they remained the property of Wm. Dripps, the plaintiff, and can be recovered in this action. This is my view of the case. I will further add, in accordance with the plaintiff’s fifth point, that even if Joseph M. Christian was not part owner of the real estate, Bisbing &amp; Burn being the owners thereof at the time the firm of Bisbing, Burn &amp; Christian was formed, became so far the owner of the lathes and other machinery brought into the common stock by Christian, that, when attached by them, the lathes became part of the freehold.</p>

The article of agreement which was entered into between Bisbing, Burn, and Christian, was not produced upon the trial; but in its absence the plaintiff gave in evidence an entry upon the firm books, made at the commencement of the partnership, by which it appeared that the real estate purchased from Dripps was credited to Bisbing &amp; Burn, together with the stock on hand and the debts due to the firm, and they were charged with the unpaid purchase-money on the real estate and the debts which the firm owed.

The seizure by the constable of the lathes upon the attachment, can in nowise affect the question of property. Even if the <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>constable acted under the direct instructions of the plaintiff, it would only tend to prove that the plaintiff was uncertain whether the lathes were real or personal property. A mistake in this respect would not prejudice his legal <em>rights; </em>for neither the principle of estoppel, nor the doctrine of election, applies to a case like the present. It would be a harsh rule that would take away a man’s property for error in judgment upon a legal question of so difficult solution as that which relates to the law of fixtures.</p>

Whether Christian had such a title to a part of the real estate as to prevent the statute of frauds from defeating it, is a question by no means free from difficulty. Be this as it may, there is no pretence for alleging that he was in possession as a tenant merely. It is plain, from the entry in the partnership book, that the real estate was treated as the joint property of the firm, and the possession of each member of the firm was in all respects like that of the other partners. All were in possession as owners, and none as tenants. They were neither paying rent to each other nor to any other person. So too the lathes were the property of the firm. Originally belonging to Christian, he had transferred them to the firm of which he was a member, and he had no more right to remove this particular property than he would have had, had it been purchased and put into the building after he became a partner. Under this state of facts, were these lathes fixtures ? Bid they constitute part of the real estate, the legal title of which was in the plaintiff? If so, then the severance, though it may have changed the character of the property, did not transfer the ownership: Roberts <em>v. </em>Dauphin Deposite Bank, 7 <em>Harris </em>71.</p>
    <p id="b278-7" data-blocks='[["BL_278.5",278,[278,1700,1161,133]]]'>The Court of Common Pleas instructed the jury, that if the evidence was believed, the lathes were attached to the freehold, and became part of the r'eal estate.</p>
    <p id="b278-8" data-blocks='[["BL_278.6",278,[275,1833,1163,643]],["BL_279.1",279,[198,449,1167,948]]]'>There was some contrariety in the evidence respecting the manner in which the lathes were put up in the machine shop. Mr. Bisbing, one of the partners, testified that the largest lathe stood on blocks, and that the lathe and blocks were fastened to the floor by screw bolts, and that the counter shaft for running the lathe, and which was part of it, was fastened by bolts to the ceiling; and the other lathes were fastened to the floor by driving staples across the feet to the floor, and the counter shafts bolted to the ceiling. All the lathes were run by steam power, but one was rigged for foot power, and partly worked with a treadle. Another witness, Ezekiel Mann, said the lathes were all fastened to the floor by staples or hooks. On the part of the defendant, it was stated by one witness that the lathes were, not fastened to the floor in any manner. But the question is not whether these lathes were bolted and strapped to the floor and <a id="p279" href="#p279" data-label="279" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*279</a>ceiling; for if they were a necessary part of the machinery for carrying on the business of the machine shop, they belonged to the manufactory, whether bolted to the floor or not. That a machine shop for manufacturing railroad cars would be incomplete, if not useless, without lathes, is almost a self-evident proposition; and that one of these lathes was little used, is not material, for the character of the machinery does not depend upon its frequent use, nor upon its' precise adaptation to the purposes for which it is intended. In Voorhis <em>v. </em>Freeman, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 116" data-case-ids="1853586" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0116-01">2 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>116</a>, duplicate rolls in an iron rolling-mill were held to be fixtures, because they might be wanted in an emergency, as those in use were liable to be broken. Voorhis and Freeman, where it was held that the rolls of a mill were part of the freehold, because they were necessary in manufacturing iron, followed as it was by Pyle <em>v. </em>Pennock, <a href="/watts-serg/2/0390-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 390" data-case-ids="1853534" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0390-01">2 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>390</a>, and repeatedly recognised by subsequent cases, is of unquestioned authority; and the principle there ruled is applicable to the case in hand, for it is clear that lathes are as necessary in a machine shop as rolls are in a rolling-mill. It was not in the power of the defendant to evade this rule of law by proving that there was a custom in opposition to it; and the rejection of the question relative to damages, even if erroneous, becomes immaterial by the verdict of the jury.</p>
    <p id="b279-13" data-blocks='[["BL_279.4",279,[986,1398,334,42]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
