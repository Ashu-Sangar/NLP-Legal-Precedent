The property sold consisted of twenty-five acres of land, situate in Doylestown township. About the 1st of April, 1855,</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b161-10" data-blocks='[["BL_161.8",161,[137,1176,1166,474]]]'>Beek commenced the erection of a large building forty feet high, two hundred and fifty feet long, with two wings of fifty feet square each, on the same land, the buildings and grounds being designed for holding agricultural and other public exhibitions. The grounds were graded and enclosed with a high, tight board fence, with entrances and ticket offices. Stalls and pens for cattle, &amp;c., extended around the greater part of the enclosure. There were gas works erected in a separate building, for the purpose of lighting the main structure. The principal building was so far completed, that an exhibition, commencing 21st August, and continuing four days, was held in it and on the grounds.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b161-11" data-blocks='[["BL_161.9",161,[136,1650,1163,130]]]'>After the commencement of the buildings, The Doylestown Bank, and various other parties, recovered judgments against Beek, the owner of the premises.</p>

Yardley, Esq., an auditor to report the facts and make distribution. Before the auditor the fund was claimed by the appellants, on their mechanic’s liens filed, and by <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>the judgment-creditors. The auditor decided that the appellant’s liens were lost by the destruction of the building, and reported in favour of awarding the fund to the judgment-creditors. To this report exceptions were <em>filed; </em>but the court below (Smyser, P. J.) dismissed the exceptions, and, delivering the following opinion, decreed distribution according to the auditor’s report.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b162-6" data-blocks='[["BL_162.4",162,[313,704,1162,472]]]'>“ The lien of mechanics and material-men attaches to the -building primarily, and to the land only incidentally, as necessary to the proper use and enjoyment of the building. If no building is erected, there is no lien on the material, merely as such; and, on the other hand, if the latter is furnished on the credit and for the use of the former, the lien exists, whether the material is actually ¡out into the building or not. It follows, therefore, that when the building ceases to exist, by its being destroyed by fire or any other accident, the lien, having no longer anything to attach itself to, or in which it ean inhere, is gone. <em>A fortiori </em>is this the case when such destruction precedes the filing and entry thereof.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="Aox" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[313,1175,1162,727]]]'>“ These principles are definitely asserted and settled in the case of The Presbyterian Church <em>v. </em>Stetler, 2 <em>Casey </em>246. The only question that seems to be left for the consideration of the court, is, whether in this instance there has been a total destruction of the building as such. This, the facts found by the auditor, and the evidence returned, fully establish; and our personal knowledge, drawn from a view of the wreck, if we were at liberty to bo governed by that, most entirely justifies and sustains them. There is nothing left to repair; if reconstructed, it would be an entirely new erection, with the exception, perhaps, of the foundations and part of the flooring. It is sufficiently manifest that nothing of the kind was contemplated by the former owner or contractor. What the sheriff’s vendees may intend, we have, of course, no means of ascertaining. But, were such a thing to be done, the labour and materials employed therein would be the foundation of new and independent liens, which would be almost valueless, if the old original liens are to be considered as attaching to the new structure.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b162-8" data-blocks='[["BL_162.6",162,[311,1896,1161,435]]]'>“Neither can this class of claimants be suffered to take out of the fund in court, a sum equivalent to the value of the materials remaining on the ground, after the overthrow of the building. Being resolved into its original elements again, the case is, for the purposes of lien, as though there had never been a building erected out of them. They are there, but they are not in any structure. There is none in existence, for which, or on the credit of which, they were furnished. The lien attaches to the building, and not to the material, merely as such; and here there is now material only.</p>

There, all that is done, may well be regarded as part and parcel of the original construction itself. It is in no sense, either a new building, or the repair of a former one.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b163-6" data-blocks='[["BL_163.4",163,[143,579,1167,729]]]'>“ The stalls, ticket offices, gasometer and shed over it, are the mere appurtenances of the main building; and these liens are not filed specifically against them; nor, I imagine, could they have been. As incidents they follow the fate of their principal. In some of the claims filed, these outside erections are not named at all. In others, they are merely referred to in general terms, as appurtenances pertaining to the convenient use of the main building, which alone is described in the manner required by law. It cannot be successfully pretended that a lien can continue to attach to a mere appurtenance, after it has ceased to bind that to which the latter was appurtenant. These claims only purport to bind the sheds, fences, &amp;c., as appurtenances to the building. That being destroyed, they cease to be appurtenant. It cannot be claimed, that, although no longer bound as appurtenances, they may be as separate or independent structures, for in that point of view, the liens filed are wholly worthless, for want of necessary and legal description.</p>

      <em>“ </em>Whatever we may think of the hardship of the case of this class of creditors, we must not forget that they are clothed with special privileges and preferences, to the destruction of that equality in which equity delights; and that, not so much on the ground of their being a more meritorious class, as because the growth and improvement of the country is supposed to be promoted thereby. Being a privileged class, they may be entitled to a liberal construction of the law in their favour, especially in matters of form or mere technicalities; but although entitled to a liberal, they have no right to a latitudinarian construction, embracing matters neither within the letter or the spirit of the law. In an absolute sense, it is just as hard for the creditor, who advances the funds for the erection of the building, to lose his money, as for the man •who puts into it his labour or material, and, apart from positive law, he has an equal right to repayment. If postponed on principles of public policy, the preference should cease when the policy ceases. Now where a building is blown down or destroyed, the policy, from that moment, is the other way; for, if the original claims still remained liens on the reconstructed building, then, so far as improvement depends on privileged liens, it would be arrested or greatly impeded, instead of being promoted.</p>

When would the lien upon the ground be so fixed, that the destruction of the building would not divest it, or is it liable to be so defeated at any time before the actual collection of the money Y Such a construction would greatly lessen the confidence of mechanics in their security, and would in a measure defeat the purposes of the law.</p>

The appellants advanced their materials and labour, not on the security of the main building alone, but on that of the whole property and improvements, every part of which was necessary to the enjoyment of the principal structure. The ground itself was not worth much more than the mortgage upon it; while the value of the materials remaining' is nearly as much as the fund in court.</p>
