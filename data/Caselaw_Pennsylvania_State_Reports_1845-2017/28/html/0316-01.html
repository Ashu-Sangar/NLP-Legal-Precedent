    <p id="b317-7" data-blocks='[["BL_317.7",317,[191,616,1161,387]]]'>The action was in <em>assumpsit, </em>brought to recover compensation for cultivating and preserving morus multicaulis trees. In the fall of 1838 the defendants delivered to the plaintiffs a quantity of mulberry trees, said to be about five thousand in number, which were buried by the plaintiffs for preservation. In the spring of 1839 the trees were taken up, cut into slips, and planted; from twenty-five to thirty thousand trees were raised and cultivated from the slips during the summer of 1839, and were buried for preservation in October, 1839.</p>

    <p id="b317-13" data-blocks='[["BL_317.13",317,[196,1519,1163,729]]]'>According to the evidence, by the spring of 1840 the bubble had burst, and the market for morus multicaulis trees was down to zero. We are not informed what became of the trees in question. They were probably thrown away as worthless. This suit was commenced on the 9th of March, 1846. There was no evidence of any actual labour having been expended upon the trees by the plaintiffs within six years from the commencement of the action, but it is by no means clear that the contract between the parties for the cultivation and safe-keeeping of the trees was at an end before March, 1840. On the contrary, the letter of the 4th of May, 1840, indicated that the trees were then in the possession of the plaintiffs, subject to the defendants’ order, and that the agreement, between the parties whatever it was, had not been fully performed. It was the province of the jury under the evidence to say when the cause of action accrued: and as they have found that it was within six years from the commencement of the suit, the statute was no bar to the plaintiffs’ recovery.</p>
