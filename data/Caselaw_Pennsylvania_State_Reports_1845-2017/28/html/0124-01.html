One of these notes was paid, and the defendants resisted the payment of the note in suit, because of an alleged failure of title to 115 acres of the land conveyed, and being part of a tract warranted in the name of Edward Edgerton. The warrant to Edgerton was dated on the 31st October, 1785, and the survey was made the 20th November of the same year, and a patent was issued to John Hollenback, the then owner, on the 5th September, 1836, and a regular chain of conveyances to the plaintiff, for this as well as the other tracts. The defendants showed a warrant to Alexander Patterson for 300 acres, dated 3d May, 1787, and a survey thereon on the 18th May of the same year, and proved that the title to this tract by a regular chain of conveyances from the warrantee became5vested in 1839 in Abisha Jenkins, in trust to reeonvey to Daniel Parry and Matthew C. Jenkins, as trustees of the Pine Forest Company. And that on the 22d January, 1854, these trustees conveyed to Isaac F. Pearson and Stiles Williams under this survey. This latter survey, it was alleged by the defendants, covered 115 acres of the land embraced in the Edward Edgerton survey, and sold by the plaintiff to the defendants. And that the persons claiming under this junior survey had entered upon it, and cleared and cultivated a part of it, and erected upon it a dwelling-house, a saw-mill, and other improvements, and had continued to occupy it for a period of forty years and upwards. There was no clearing or cultivation or buildings erected within the lines of the interference, but the defendants alleged that the claimants had entered under the survey, claiming to the extent of its boundaries, and that these were well known and distinctly marked upon the ground, and that the part not cleared and cultivated had been used for cutting timber for the saw-mills, firewood, and fencing.</p>

By deed dated 1st December, 1851, Beaupland sold to McKeen and Pursell eight tracts of land in Luzerne county for $27,250; of this sum all has been paid except the note on which this suit is brought. The payment of this, a part of the said consideration, is resisted upon the ground that 114 or 115 acres of the land sold did not belong to Beaupland at the time of the sale. If -any part of the land sold did not belong to Beaupland, McKeen is entitled to a deduction from the note to the extent of the damage suffered by him and Pursell from the failure of title to that part. If the damage equals the value of the note, the note is not to be paid; failure of consideration is a defence to the extent of the failure. The primary question then is, did McKeen and Pursell get a good title to the 114 acres in controversy? These 114 acres lie in what is called the Edgerton tract, one of the eight tracts enumerated in the deed of Beaupland to McKeen and Pursell ; McKeen alleges that these 114 acres also lie in that part called the Patterson tract, a tract not by name included in the deed from Beaupland, but belonging to one Stiles Williams and <a id="p128" href="#p128" data-label="128" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*128</a>others. The title to the Edgerton tract is the oldest, the warrant for it is dated 31st October, 1785; and the survey of it is dated 20th November, 1785, but it remained unseated (unoccupied) till a few years ago. The warrant of the Patterson tract is dated 3d May, 1787, and the survey of it is dated 18th May, 1787. The Patterson tract has been occupied without intermission for a long time. The warrant describes it as including a saw-mill and improvement made by Patterson, and witnesses here have testified that for fifty years and more it has been constantly occupied. You would have little difficulty in deciding that the Patterson tract has had tenants on it almost from the time of its survey until the present time. From the manner in which the public lands of Pennsylvania were surveyed and sold, it frequently happened that adjoining surveys run into each other. In running over an extensive wooded country the surveyor would sometimes locate a new survey in whole or in part upon former surveys. A subsequent deputy might not know where his predecessor had surveyed. Interferences of this kind have been so frequently before the Supreme Court, that the rules for disposing of them have been judicially made known. Of these rules of law, those applicable to the present case are the following:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b128-6" data-blocks='[["BL_128.4",128,[272,1302,1154,171]]]'>“ First, Where two surveys run into each other, and the owners of each are in possession, or both are out of possession, the law gives the <em>interference </em>to him who has the oldest title: Hole <em>v. </em>Rittenhouse, 7' <em>Harris </em>307.</p>

It is this view of the case that led the counsel to attach so much importance to the hemlock corner. Was the <a id="p129" href="#p129" data-label="129" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*129</a>hemlock marked as a corner of the Patterson survey? Was the Patterson tract located in reference to that corner ? This is a question of fact. The primary question of fact for you. In relation to this question you have the testimony, including that of the two surveyors. You also have the positions of counsel respecting that testimony, and you will determine the effect to be attached to it. If the hemlock was not marked as a corner of the Patterson survey, then that tract has no monument on the ground, and you need look no further. The sale of the Edgerton tract for taxes, and the payment of taxes by Beaupland, does not affect the title to the interference, nor change the possession. Payment of taxes is not an act of possession: it is an act based on title, not on possession; it is evidence of ownership, not of occupancy. The fact that Williams was the agent of Beaupland does not affect the title to the Patterson tract, if that title was complete before the Patterson tract came into possession of Williams. As to the reservation in the deed to swell the water, we say to you, that any admission by Williams to the owner that ho did not claim the interference, would stop the running of the statute. The reservation was to flow water, possibly on to other lands of McKeen and Pursell. An admission distinctly made that one does not claim under the statute of limitations, would preclude him from claiming, But such an admission should be accompanied by greater certainty than is contained in this reservation. If you find McKeen and Pursell’s title to the 114 acres to be good, you need not inquire about damages. What is the damage to McKeen and Pursell, if you find that the interference belongs to the Patterson survey ? The damage is the value of the land lost, taking into view the object for w’hich it w'as purchased and its relation to the other tracts. You can probably have little difficulty in arriving at the conclusion that the tracts were sold to McKeen and Pursell for lumbering purposes. Fancy damages are not allowed. But a saw-mill is not a fancy matter. You are to look at the tracts and at the interference, not as a locality for a town, but as a lumber tract, and estimate the interference accordingly, in itself and in its connexion with the rest of the purchase. The plaintiff’s fourth point is answered in the negative. If a tract of land be laid out, forty perches on a stream of water by four hundred perches deep, the loss of an acre four perches by forty along the stream may he more in value than the one-hundredth part of the tract. The other points of the parties are sufficiently answered in the general charge. The first points of each are correct and stand together, the plaintiff’s being in the negative, and the defendants’ in the affirmative. To this charge both parties except, and it is written and filed.”</p>

Williams has not indeed evicted the purchasers, nor even threatened to disturb them. The tract which he purchased did not belong to this body of lands — was a younger survey — and interferes only to the extent of 115 acres with one of the tracts sold by the plaintiff to the defendants. There is not a fact or suggestion on this record to lead to the suspicion that Williams or Pearson &amp; Williams intend to take away from the defendants or even to claim the interference.</p>

The title of Pearson &amp; Williams, if the best for the interference,can never disturb MeKeen and Pursell, because, they have estopped themselves from setting it up and asserting it. They were doubtless in possession of the Patterson tract whilst acting as agents of Beaupland ; but let it be granted that they had no interest whatever in the tract, and that the title to it has been acquired since their agency ceased, the question then is whether a party who stands by and encourages two several purchases of the same land, receives a commission on the sale, surveys and adjusts lines, and performs all necessary acts for the protection of the apparent title, can afterward buy up and assert a better title to part of the land ? Surely he cannot, until all distinctions between fraud and fair dealing come to be confounded. He is estopped from denying the right in whose existence he gave the purchaser reason to confide: <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20209" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Watts &amp; Serg. 209">5 W. &amp; S. 209</a>.</p>

J., in Robinson <em>v. </em>Justice, 2 <em>Penn. R. </em>22. Though the ordinary effect of estoppel is confined to the persons of those to whom it attaches, yet where it arises upon the conveyance of land, it operates upon the estate apart from the person. Thus in Raulin’s Case, 4 <em>Coke </em>52, where A. having nothing in land demised it by indenture to B. for six years, the lease was good at the time as against the lessor, but when he obtained a subsequent term for twenty-one years in the same land, the term itself was bound by the estoppel, and the lease became good against all parties to whom the estate might subsequently come. So it was held in Helps <em>v. </em>Hereford, 2 <em>B. &amp; Ald. </em>242, that a fine levied by an heir who had no estate in the land at the time either contingent or vested, bound the estate by estoppel upon its subsequent descent from the ancestor. And see Webb <em>v. </em>Austin, 7 <em>M. &amp; G. </em>701, and Doe <em>v. </em>Oliver and the notes thereto, in 2 <em>Smith’s Leading Cases, </em>Am. ed., 620.</p>

If, then, the Patterson survey was the better title — if, when McKeen and Pursell purchased the Edgerton tract, the Pine Forest Company might have taken away the interference from them — the moment that title vested^ in Pearson &amp; Williams it enured to the benefit of Beaupland, and through him to McKeen and Pursell, and thereby extinguished all defence to the note in suit. Whatever hazards of loss they were exposed to when they made their note, they are exposed to none now, for the parties who encouraged them to invest money in that title have bought in the adversary title, and are restrained by a salutary rule of law from asserting it to their prejudice.</p>

    <p id="b133-7" data-blocks='[["BL_133.5",133,[129,816,1167,804]]]'>The case involved an interference of surveys. The Edgerton tract, for which in part the note was given, was the oldest survey, and the Patterson tract, now owned by Pearson &amp; Williams, and interfering with the Edgerton to the extent of 115 acres, is the younger survey. There was an ancient possession on the Patterson tract, not within the interference, but at a well known point on the Easton and Wilkesbarre turnpike, called Bear Creek. Here was a tavern-house and saw-mill from an early day, and a few acres of land cleared and cultivated. There had been no actual possession of the Edgerton tract. The learned judge, following the doctrine which originated with Waggoner and Hastings, 5 <em>Barr </em>300, and was recognised by two judges of this court in Hole <em>v. </em>Rittenhouse, 7 <em>Harris </em>306, the first time that case appeared in this court, ruled that the possession of the Patterson tract at Bear Creek ivas in law a possession of all the land within the lines of the survey; and, if kept up for twenty-one years, rvould give title to the whole tract. This established the Patterson title to the interference, and to that extent failure was shown in the consideration of the note in suit.</p>

They agree that Hastings <em>v. </em>Waggoner and its cognates are not law, and that it was a mistake to rest this cause on them, but they maintain that the result arrived at by the court below was right, because the evidence clearly showed that there had been actual possession of the interference for more than twenty-one years by those claiming title to the Patterson tract. This is denied on the other side, and it is said the only possession of the interference was by timber-stealers, who <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>were unconnected with the Patterson title.

Constructive possession would not oust the real owner of the Edgerton survey, but actual possession would, and such acts as I have enumerated, have repeatedly been held to constitute actual possession. The marking of lines -and payment of taxes would be additional assertions of ownership which would help to make out the actual possession. But, if this was mere marauders’ ground — if anybody Avho wanted to get lumber manufactured at the Bear Creek mill went upon the interference to take timber without regard to the Patterson title — if, in a word, the only acts of possession were occasional entries for lumbering purposes, they would not constitute the possession essential to title: Sorber <em>v. </em>Willing, <a href="/watts/10/0141-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Watts 141" data-case-ids="1851003" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0141-01">10 <em>Watts </em>141</a>.</p>
