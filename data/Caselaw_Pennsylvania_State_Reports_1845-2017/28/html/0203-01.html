W. </em>824; 10 <em>Id. </em>425 <em>(S. C. </em>19 <em>Eng. L. </em>&amp; <em>R. 11. </em>295); 4 <em>Id. </em>265 (S. C. 16 <em>Queen’s B. R. </em>643, <em>6 Bailw. C. </em>656). In so deciding, we did not overrule Yeiser’s Case, because of a difference which we pointed out in the cases, without saying that that difference called for a difference in the results. And though the distinction there alluded to does not exist here, yet it is insisted that there is such a difference between Hummel’s Case and this, as to demand that this should be differently decided.</p>

Indeed when we consider that the legislature, in all such cases, intend to provide for all real damages and no more, and that it is impossible for different men to express this idea in the same terms, except by copying from each other, we incline to look for the same thought, rather than for different ones, even where the forms of expression are different. On no other principle could we ever arrive at anything like system in dealing with these corporations. These views decide at once the points of evidence and of instruction. There was no need of a declaration.</p>
