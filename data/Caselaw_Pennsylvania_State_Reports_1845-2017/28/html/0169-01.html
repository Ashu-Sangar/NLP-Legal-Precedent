The property sold was known as the “ Pottsville House,” and was formerly owned by George H. Stichter, who executed a mortgage to the Miners’ Bank of Potts-ville upon it, and under proceedings upon which the property was sold to George W. Slater for $8000. After satisfying the mortgage, debt and costs, there remained the sum of $2468.02, which was in court for distribution.</p>

McGowan, on the 26th day of July, 1858, conveyed the property to George W. Slater. The sale under the mortgage was made on the 3d September, 1853. Slater, by virtue of this conveyance, claimed that he was entitled to the money in court.</p>

Their judgment was against McGowan and wife for her appropriate debt, and they had levied on her separate estate, which had been extended at a yearly rental of $1300, and the auditor reports “ that under this extent she retains possession of the property at $he rental fixed by the inquest.” This is all we know about it. Whether the plaintiffs had ever signified their election to the <a id="p171" href="#p171" data-label="171" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*171</a>sheriff, according to the Acts of Assembly — whether she had given the required notice of her willingness to retain possession under the extent — whether she had paid any money to them — or when her liability for the rent commenced, are matters' on which the record gives no information whatever; and the question is, whéther such an extent is satisfaction of the plaintiff’s judgment ?

If land have been delivered to the creditor in the extent, he is bound to account for the proceeds, and these, to the amount that he has or might have received them, are satisfaction; but if he elects to leave the premises in possession of the debtor, he has no way of compelling payment of the rental, and is not chargeable for it until he receives it. The consequence of non-payment is his right to a <em>venditioni exponas; </em>but if he sees a shorter way of getting satisfaction from the other debtor, there is nothing to prevent his pursuing it.</p>
