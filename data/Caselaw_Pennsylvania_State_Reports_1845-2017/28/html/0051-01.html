To his step-son, Henry H. Tucker, he gave in perpetuity a legacy of four thousand dollars. To his brother Philip Hoff, his nieces Mrs. Knight and Mrs. Newell, his nephews Henry, John C., and George Hoff, were also given legacies of various amounts. Other devises were made by the will but which it is not necessary specifically to designate. The residuary clause is in these words:</p>

    <p id="b58-7" data-blocks='[["BL_58.5",58,[299,691,1163,1027]]]'>It is argued by the appellees that Mrs. Hoff ought to be excluded from the residuary estate, because she was not an heir or relative of the testator, and because her bequests were for life and widowhood, in lieu of other property secured to her by a marriage settlement. We do not see the force of these objections. It is obvious that the testator used the words “my heirs” not in their legal sense, but as designating the objects of his bounty under the will. It is not unusual for an unprofessional man to use the word heir as applicable to a devisee or legatee; and that it was used in this sense by John Hoff, is manifest from the clause excluding the seminary, the church, and the state of Hoff in Africa. Any other construction would make this clause utterly senseless. There is no ground for the supposition that the testator intended to give the residue of his estate to his brother, his nephews and nieces, to the exclusion of his wife and step-son, for these, though not heirs at law, nor relatives by blood, were included in the former bequests and were relations by marriage. The testator, in clear and unmistakeable language, has said which of the devisees were to be excluded from the residuary estate, and we cannot make the exclusion embrace those not mentioned by him. That the previous bequests to Mrs. Hoff were for life and widowhood, and upon condition that she received them as a substitute for the marriage settlement, may limit the duration of her interest in the residuary estate, but these considerations cannot defeat her claim altogether.</p>

To exclude her altogether or to give her an absolute estate, would not be an equal division “as per ratio in the bequests.” In ascertaining the amount that should be set aside for her, the value of the house left to her at the death of the testator should be added to the fifteen thousand dollars in stocks; and so much of the fund on hand for distribution as was produced by the income of the amount belonging to her, belongs to her absolutely, and her interest in the remainder of her part will be for life and widowhood.</p>
