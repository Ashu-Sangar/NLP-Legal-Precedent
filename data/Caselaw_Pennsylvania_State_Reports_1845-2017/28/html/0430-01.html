After the evidence was closed, it was agreed in writing by the counsel that the jury should be discharged and that the court should pronounce the law upon the <em>“facts in the case.’’ </em>What facts ? Not one is set down as ascertained and established. The evidence is here, but how much of it the jury would have believed, and what conclusions they would have deduced from it, we are left to conjecture, and that without the slightest assistance from the court below; for, without a word of explanation, they entered judgment for the defendants. This was a very proper judgment on a case so presented, whatever its merits; and our duty would be fully performed in affirming the judgment on the ground that the case is not so stated as to enable us to review it on its merits. To bring up the crude evidence without an attempted analysis of it either by counsel or a jury, indicates a strange misconception of the duties of this court of review. We would not undertake to reverse a judgment on such facts as we might find from an undigested mass of evidence, because the discovery of facts is no part of our appropriate work.</p>

The proof is that the grant was made — the estate created on a nominal con<a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>sideration — that it was a farm yielding rents and profits — and it is a very fair presumption that these were adequate to discharge the very small indebtedness and to support the brief remnant of the grantor’s life. It does not appear that Rath paid anything or had any interest in the land except as trustee. His wife and Susanna paid the only debt we hear of; and if he may claim that their earnings belonged to him, and therefore that it was a payment by him, we will presume him compensated by the rents and profits, at least until he renders an account.</p>
    <p id="b433-6" data-blocks='[["BL_433.4",433,[152,815,1165,344]]]'>It looks to us as a simple and direct trust, under which no beneficial interest vested or was intended to vest in the trustee, which his creditors could touch. Undoubtedly a debtor cannot convey his estate or cause it to be conveyed in trust for the use of his family to the prejudice of his creditors; but this was never the estate of Ferdinand Rath, nor was any part of his estate taken to purchase it. His creditors could not be delayed or hindered by any use Polly Rupp might make of her estate.</p>

They had all the remedies against their debtor after the trust they had before. The purchaser at the sheriff’s sale acquired no interest in the land, because Rath was a naked trustee, without an interest to be bound by his creditors’ judgment.</p>
