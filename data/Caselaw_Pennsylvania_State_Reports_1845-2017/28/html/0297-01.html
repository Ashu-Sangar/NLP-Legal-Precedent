      <em>“ </em>The pleadings do not raise any question as to the validity of the pardon, but its effect so far as regards <em>the fine </em>is the question brought’ forward by the record. The power of the -governor, under the' constitution, <em>‘ </em>to remit fines and forfeitures and grant reprieves and pardons,’ is clear; this power is very analogous to that of the king in England. It is equally clear under the views of the Supreme Court in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Denniston, <a href="/watts/9/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Watts 142" data-case-ids="1850053" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0142-01">9 <em>Watts </em>142</a>, and Stroop <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, 3 <em>Barr </em>126, that though this fine, since the Act of 24th March, 1818, belongs to the county of Northampton, still the governor would have the same power to remit it, as he would have had, if this act had not been passed; and it had, therefore, continued to be the property of the Commonwealth, as was the case with such fines at the time of the adoption of the constitution of 1790. .</p>

Air. </em>8, p. 81, in note. This would be certainly true of a pardon <em>before </em>conviction and imposition of a fine. In each case the offence being pardoned, the individual is thereby entirely restored:. <a href="/citations/?q=17%20Pin.%2053" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="17 Pin. 53">17 <em>Pin. </em>53</a>, pi. 7; 6 <em>Pep. </em>136; Duncan <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 4 <em>8. Sp P. </em>451. There are also many other cases to which we might refer confirmatory of this doctrine. We have no difficulty in saying, then, that the governor had the power to remit this fine, and that if he had pardoned the alleged crime of Dr. Lachenaur in words a&lt;s broad as the present, as to the offence, before sentence, no such sentence for a fine could have been legally passed upon him.</p>

      <a id="p299" href="#p299" data-label="299" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*299</a>“ A vested right, however, in another arising out of the commission of an offence and the sentence therefor, cannot be pardoned by the governor any more than it can by the king: King <em>v. </em>Codington and Rudman, <em>Oro. 0. </em>199; <em>Hawh. </em>Book 2,„ch. 37, sec. 34; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Denniston, <a href="/watts/9/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 Watts 142" data-case-ids="1850053" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0142-01">9 <em>Watts </em>142</a>; McDonald’s Case, <a href="/whart/2/0440-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Whart. 440" data-case-ids="1830521" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0440-01">2 <em>Wh. </em>440</a>. The reason why this cannot be done is because other parties have vested interests, over whose interests the governor has constitutionally no control. He only has power over the person of the defendant, and the rights of the Commonwealth whether vested or otherwise. There is no difficulty in the conclusion, that the pardon in this case remitted the imprisonment of the defendant, as far. as it was ordered as immediate punishment by the court. This was personal to the defendant, and the pardon was intended to put him personally in the same situation, as that in which he stood before he was found guilty of the offence charged upon him. No other person was interested in this imprisonment, or claimed any right under it. It must be recollected that we mean the term of confinement fixed by the sentence, not that which was collateral and dependent upon the non-payment of the fine.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b299-7" data-blocks='[["BL_299.4",299,[187,1224,1168,1202]],["BL_300.1",300,[274,417,1166,259]]]'>“ Is the effect of the pardon upon the fine different ? <em>‘ </em>General words have a very imperfect effect in pardons:’ 5 <em>Jae. L: H. </em>29. From the moment of the sentence the right to the fine became vested in the county, as the statutory representative of the Commonwealth : Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Denniston, 9 <em>Watts. </em>The governor <em>might </em>still have remitted it, as we have said, though it had become a vested interest; he has not done so, however, by express words. Whether these general words can, by implication, be extended so as to cover this case, is the question for us to consider. In making an answer we must refer to analogous doctrines recognised in England, in treatises and decisions, putting the king in the place of the county, in the English books. £ It seems to be a settled rule, that no pardon by the king, without <em>express words of </em>restitution, shall divest either from <em>the king </em>or subject,'an interest either in lands or goods, vested in them by an attainder or conviction precedent:’ <em>Hawh. </em>Book 2, ch. 37, s. 54. As no pardon from the king shall divest any interest vested in the subject, <em>so neither shall it without ivords of restitution ever divest anything from the </em>hing5 <em>Baa. Ahr. </em>title <em>Pardon, </em>II. 295-6. Again, in 3 <em>Mod,. </em>52, King <em>v. </em>Turvill, it is said: £ But legal consequences are not thus pardoned; as if a man is outlawed in trespass, and the king pardons the outlawry, <em>the fine remains:’ </em>see 2 <em>Boll. </em>179. In this case also, it was held that a vested interest in the king was not divested by a general act of pardon, when the particular right was not plainly covered by even general words of restitution. The point is also fully conceded by the counsel in argument on both sides in Rex <em>v. </em>Johnson, 3 <em>Mod. </em>341-2-3; see also 3 <em>Mod. </em>100, Rex <em>v. </em>Salaway. But the case of Toomes <em>v. </em>Etherington, 1 <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>
      <em>Saund. </em>862-8, seems to be more clearly in point. There, though there was a general act of pardon, with words and language very full indeed, yet there being no words of restitution, a forfeiture of a debt due to a <em>felo de se </em>in his lifetime, and after inquisition found became vested in the king, was not affected by such act of pardon.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b300-6" data-blocks='[["BL_300.4",300,[262,673,1174,247]]]'>“ This seems to be clearly the doctrine recognised in England with regard to forfeitures, and we cannot find any later cases doubting it. We have not had it in our power to examine all the books-, from the fact that many of them are not within our reach, 'and we can only give our opinion so far as our examination has been made.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b300-7" data-blocks='[["BL_300.5",300,[271,929,1164,598]]]'>“ We do not, however, discover any distinction between the meaning <em>oí fines </em>and <em>forfeitures </em>in the article of our constitution giving power to the governor to remit them, or in the rules of law properly applicable to them. Fines and forfeitures are of the same general nature, part of the punishment on the conviction of an offence; the result of such conviction; and so far alike as giving under each vested interests, in England to the king, in this country to the proper county. The reason of the rules we have stated above, is the same; a forfeiture is not divested by general words, after it is vested in the king; a fine is clearly of the same character, falling within the reason of the same rules. By law the king may maintain an action for a debt or sum of money forfeited: see Toomes’ Case, <em>supra ; </em>so by the same law the king may maintain debt for a fine: 9 <em>Pet. Air. </em>670, <em>references in the note.</em>

D. </em>76; and both become <em>vested </em>in him. If general words in a pardon will not divest <em>one, </em>why should they so operate upon the other ? They are <em>vested </em>alike, and it is the vesting of the interest which prevents the discharge. In the clause of our state constitution already referred to, they are placed in the same class for executive action, and we can see no reason to apply the rule to one and not to the other. The governor may remit a fine or forfeiture going to the Commonwealth, he may reprieve or he may pardon, he may execute all or any of these several powers, and he may cover all by one instrument of writing, if he desires so to do; but the language of the writing must expressly make known its meaning, and not leave it to implication. The pardon may be conditional or absolute, partial or entire, but it is not to be extended beyond the clear and express purport of it: 5 <em>Wils. Bac. </em>

The vested interests of the king in England, as well as the vested interests of the subject, are equally protected; the only difference being that the king, having no power to affect the latter, may release his right to the former,’but this must be done by express words showing the intent to discharge. Why should it in this country be otherwise with regard to the vested rights of the Commonwealth? In. the ease of Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Baldwin, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Watts%2055" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Watts 55">1 <em>Watts </em>55</a>, the Supreme Court say, so much of the king;s prerogative as belonged to him, ‘ in the capacity of <em>parens </em>patrix, or universal trustee, enters as much into our political compact, as it does in the principles of the British, constitution,’ and again, ‘this prerogative is a principle of our government and a part of the law of the land.’ See also Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Hutchinson, 10 <em>Barr </em>466. The claim in each country is of the same character. The money arising for fines belonging originally to the king, by virtue of his prerogative in England, in this country at first to the governor of the colony by the same right, then transferred by the Act of 28th January, 1777, to the Commonwealth, and a similar rule of law -in both countries regulating the enjoyment of this right; why does it not necessarily follow that when the rule so clearly appears in England, the same reason must not make it the rule with us ?</p>

The term general pardon is sometimes used, and it may be supposed at first to be similar to the one before the court, which is called a general pardon; but so far as our research has enabled us to examine, a general pardon in England contained sections and clauses, providing for the restitution and discharge of fines and forfeitures.</p>

The effect of a pardon is to acquit the offender of all the penalties annexed to the conviction, and to give him a new credit and capacity: In the matter of Deming, <a href="/johns/10/0234-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="10 Johns. 232" data-case-ids="2136001" data-case-paths="/johns/10/0234-01">10 <em>John. </em>232</a>. The word “pardon” includes in itself the word “release,” and it will therefore discharge an <em>immediate debtor </em>to the king, although it would not discharge process under which the king had seized the goods of one who was debtor to the king’s debtor: <em>Sid. </em>265; 17 <em>Viner’s Abr. </em>24, Lock <em>v. </em>Etherington. It is true that the costs, for which a judgriient has been given, are not remitted by a pardon of the offence subsequent to the judgment, but the reason is that there was an interest vested in private persons ; in every other respect the pardon was held to operate as a discharge: King &amp; Codington <em>v. </em>Rodman, <em>Cro. Car. </em>199; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Denniston, <a href="/watts/9/0142-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="9 Watts 142" data-case-ids="1850053" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0142-01">9 <em>Watts </em>142</a>; Duncan <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 4 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>451. It is also true that where the .king by means of office found, or otherwise, is deemed in possession of the goods or chattels of the offender, a pardon, without words of restitution, will not restore the goods or. chattels. But where the king has nothing but a <em>demand </em>against the offender for a fine or sum of money, a pardon of the offence, although after sentence, <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>is a release of all fines imposed as punishment for it, for the reason already assigned, that the word “ pardon” includes in it the word “release.” Sheriffs cannot collect fines or issues after a general pardon: Marmot’s Case, <em>Grodb. </em>178; 17 <em>Viner’s Abr. </em>24. A. was convicted of nuisance, and fined; afterwards came the general pardon. The court held that he was discharged thereby only as to the <em>fine, </em>and not as to the abatement of the nuisance, for that is not a punishment to the party but a remedy for the grievance to other people: <em>Salk. </em>458; The King and Queen <em>v. </em>Wilcox, 17 <em>Viner’s Abr. 25. </em>In The Queen <em>v. </em>Barret, <em>Salic. </em>383, the only objection urged why a general pardon should not discharge a fine after conviction and sentence, was, that in that case the forfeiture belonged to the party grieved. It was formerly doubted whether a pardon could do more than take away the punishment, leaving the crime and its disabling consequences unremoved. But it is stated in 7 <em>Bacon’s Abr. </em>416, to be “ now settled that a pardon, whether by the king or by act of parliament, removes not only the punishment but all the legal disabilities consequent on the crime.” The limitation to this general rule is that a pardon cannot divest any person of any right or interest which the law had permitted to be acquired and vested in consequence of the judgment: <em>Hawk. </em>tit. <em>Pardon, </em>ch. 37, s. 34, 54; <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Johns.%20233" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="10 Johns. 233">10 <em>John. </em>233</a>. We can readily understand why the pardon of an outlawry would not remit the fine imposed for the trespass. But it is not easy to reconcile all the decisions on the effect of pardons. We are satisfied, however, that although the remission of the fine imposed would not discharge the offender from all the consequences of his guilt, a full pardon of the offence would: Holliday <em>v. </em>The People of Illinois, 5 <em>Grillman </em>214. In the case before us we have the offence fully recited, together with the sentence including the fine. We have also the recitals showing that the executive was satisfied that Daniel Lachenaur, before his conviction of conspiracy, was “ a man of high character,” and that “ the principal if not the only evidence against him was the testimony of a person already convicted of a felony, and of otherwise notoriously bad character for truth.” These reasons operate as strongly in favour of remitting the fine of $2500, as in favour of discharging any of the other consequences of the conviction. We have no doubt of the intention of the executive, and we think that his intention is fully expressed in the pardon. The fine was remitted by the pardon of the offence.</p>
