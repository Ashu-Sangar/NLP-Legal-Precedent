The land in dispute consisted of two tracts or parcels, the one containing 9 acres, and the other 3 acres and 18 perches. The larger tract was conveyed on the 19th January, 1791, by Martin Beeker and wife to John Sower, and he again on the 11th February, 1797, conveyed the same to George Garner, who, on the 13th May, 1797, sold by deed to Isaac Kolb. The plaintiff proved that Kolb sold the same land to Lawrence Ludenburg, and that Ludenburg purchased the 3 acres from John Martin, and that he lived on and claimed the premises as his own. No deed could be found from Kolb or Martin to Ludenburg. On the 1st April, 1812, Ludenburg conveyed the premises by deed to Susanna Beaver and her son, Abraham Beaver. They continued to occupy it as tenants in common. Abraham lived there for ten or eleven years, and then removed. Susanna resided there until 1835 or 1836, and then went to live with her son-in-law in the same neighbourhood, at which place she died in 1847. The plaintiff alleged that Abraham and his mother continued to hold it as tenants in common, up to the time of her death; while the defendant contended, and endeavoured to prove, that there had been a parol partition and a severance in the occupation.</p>

I take it, therefore, that before these defendants can be permitted to invoke the aid of Shade’s equity, they must perfect his title by a payment or tender; the rule being that outstanding title in a third party, to avail the defendant, not claiming under it, must be an available one on which the asserted owner might recover in ejectment: Thomas <em>v. </em>Wright, 9 <em>8. ‡ R. </em>87.

The Orphans’ Court clearly had jurisdiction of the <em>subject-matter, </em>and consequently the decree confirming the sale, cannot be inquired into collaterally. Such is the express terms of the Act 29th March, 1832, § 2. The case of Herr <em>v. </em>Herr, 5 <em>Barr </em>429, is decisive of this, and the cases cited <a id="p123" href="#p123" data-label="123" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*123</a>by his Honour, Judge Smyser. These cases have never been overruled, or even doubted. The plaintiff showed at least a <em>prima facie </em>title, and that should prevail against the defendants, who show no title at all. The sale was in 1848, and it is fair to presume that the heirs got the proceeds of the sale, and are satisfied with it.

The instruction complained of in this assignment is in relation to the alleged fiduciary relation between Shade and Hun-sicker, and was not given as a binding direction to the jury. If the defendants were prejudiced by this instruction, their remedy was a motion for a new trial on this ground, but this was not done. The judge had the right to instruct the jury, that upon the whole case the plaintiff was entitled to recover: Faust <em>v. </em>Ross, <em><a href="/watts-serg/1/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 501" data-case-ids="1852582" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0501-01">1 W. &amp; S. </a></em><a href="/watts-serg/1/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 501" data-case-ids="1852582" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0501-01">501</a>.</p>

It is a sufficient answer to this assignment and the argument urged in support of it, to say, that if Hunsicker’s purchase enured to the benefit of his client Shade, still he could maintain the ejectment, and if he held as trustee before, he wmuld so after the recovery. And as the defendants do not claim to hold under Shade and under this alleged trust, they cannot set it up to defeat both the title of the trustee and <em>cestui que </em>trust. The contest is not between the counsel and client, and therefore Henry <em>v. </em>Raiman, 1 <em>Casey </em>354, does not apply.</p>

As against the defendants, who show no sort of title, it was unnecessary for the plaintiff to show title out of the Commonwealth.
