Wood and John Deverenx against John Eigard for sixty acres of land. The land in dispute is part of a tract which was surveyed on the 23d May, 1797, in pursuance of a warrant dated October 20, 1796, to John Belt, whose title by regular conveyances became vested in the plaintiffs, to whom the Commonwealth granted a patent on the 24th January, 1855.</p>

The interest of Moon in the land he occupied was levied on, and sold by the sheriff to Joseph Williams, in 1812. James Figard came into possession in 1813, and on the 11th December, 1815, Williams conveyed to him. From that time to his death in 1851, or 1852, James Figard lived on the land and cleared and cultivated, claiming some 300 or 400 acres. The land was assessed and taxed in the name of Moon and Figard, from 1804 to the time of trial. A witness testified that he had surveyed the land for Figard near forty years before the trial, and had marked the lines upon the ground. These boundaries included about seventy acres of the John Belt survey, he using the unenclosed woodland embraced within his boundaries as farmers are accustomed to use such land.</p>

This survey was accepted on the 2d February, 1849. James Figard died in 1852 upon the premises, having previously made his last will and testament in writing, wherein he devised the land in dispute to his son, John Figard, the defendant in this action.</p>

Had a prayer for such instruction been made, it would have been error to have refused it. But, as the court below was not called upon to instruct the jury as to what would give possession of uncultivated and unenclosed land, we cannot reverse because every element of possession was not speci<a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>fically referred to. We are satisfied that the plaintiff received no injury from the omission, for the evidence is clear that the extent of the defendant’s claim was designated by marks upon the ground for a much <em>longer </em>period than necessary to give title by the statute.</p>
    <p id="b406-6" data-blocks='[["BL_406.4",406,[275,639,1171,935]]]'>In this controversy, the survey made under the Miers Eisher warrant is of no account whatever. If the land in dispute was not included in the John Belt survey, the plaintiff has no pretence of claim; if it is so included, the title of the Commonwealth is gone, and it matters not to her whether Nit was subsequently included in the Miers Eisher survey or not. The Commonwealth is not- defrauded because appropriated land has been included in a second survey upon a “ speculation” instead of an improvement warrant. Neither is the plaintiff injured by the character of the defendant’s warrant; for if his title was gone before the survey, by an adverse possession, he loses nothing from the fact of the interference in the two surveys. One in possession of unappropriated land, who applies for and obtains a warrant for a portion of his claim, may be said to abandon his title by improvement as to the residue; but a warrant laid by an intruder upon appropriated lands could neither make his title better nor worse. The only possible effect it could have would be to indicate the extent of his claim; but it would not be conclusive even upon the question of possession pending the twenty-one years, much less would it amount to an abandonment after the expiration of the time necessary to give title by the statute. The instruction given by the Common Pleas was correct.</p>
