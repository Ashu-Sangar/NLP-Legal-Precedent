The plaintiff showed a judgment entered1 against Ferdinand Rath in favour of Brucher &amp; Brucher, entered in the Common Pleas 13th July, 1845, for $24.06. A <em>scire facias </em>issued upon it in 1853, and judgment of revival on the 23d August, 1853, for $53.54. Also a judgment in favour of Peter Raffensberger against Rath for $16.10, entered on the 8th June, 1852. Under proceedings on these two judgments the premises in dispute were seized and sold as the property of Rath, and a sheriff’s deed duly acknowledged to the plaintiff in this action. In 1835 the title to the land in dispute was in Peter Hummer, Jr., a brother-in-law of Ferdinand Rath, and it had previously belonged to Peter Hummer, Sr., the father of Rath’s wife. In that year Peter Hummer, Jr., agreed in writing to sell the property to Rath at $15 per acre, amounting to $128.53 for the whole land. In the following year the parties went to the scrivener in whose possession the agreement was left, and by mutual consent destroyed <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>it. Peter Hummer, on the 5th May, 1836, reconveyed the property to his father for the same price that Rath was to have paid him. Shortly after this Rath and Peter Hummer, Sr., entered into a parol agreement for the property at $15 per acre. Peter Hummer, Sr., had in his hands $94 belonging to Susanna Leady, a daughter of Rath’s wife, before her marriage with him. This was to remain in the land until Susanna became of age, and in the mean time Hummer was to hold the title as security; and for the balance, $34.53, Rath was to give his notes or bonds. The agreement, although intended to be, never was reduced to writing; the notes were not given, and no part of the purchase-money was ever paid. Rath was in possession of the property from about the year 1833, and so continued until in 1847. At that time Susanna Leady having arrived at age, Peter Hummer, Sr., and wife conveyed the property to her. Rath was present at the execution of the deed to her, and assented to it. The $94 due to her from her grandfather, was deducted from the purchase-money, she paying to him the balance of $34.53.</p>

It is manifest that the sheriff’s sale conferred upon the plaintiff such title and only such as Rath had in the land at the date of the revival of the first of the above judgments and of the entry of the second.</p>

    <p id="b428-7" data-blocks='[["BL_428.5",428,[252,684,1166,980]]]'>In 1835 he entered into a written contract with Peter Hummer, Jr., for the purchase of it at $15 per acre, being for the whole $128.53, went into possession, made some improvements, but paid nothing on account of the purchase-money, and next year, after a quarrel with Hummer, gave up the contract, which was cancelled and destroyed by their mutual consent. Hummer then, on the 5th May, 1836, conveyed the title to his father, Peter Hummer, Sr., who made a parol agreement with Rath that was never reduced to writing. Rath’s wife was the daughter of Peter Hummer, Sr., and she had a daughter named Susanna Leady before she married Rath. Some $94 of money belonging to Susanna was in the hands of her grandfather, Peter Hummer, Sr., and as she lived in Rath’s family it was stipulated in the parol agreement between Hummer and Rath that this money should be considered as a payment made by Rath on the land, or rather that Rath should pay it to Susanna when she came of age, and that he should give his' note or bond to Hummer for the balance of the purchase-money, being the same in amount as that agreed on between him and Peter, Jr., and if he should be unable to pay Susanna, the place was to be sold, she was to be first paid out of the proceeds, and the residue was to go to Rath. Such in substance was the parol arrangement under which Rath and his family continued in possession.</p>
    <p id="b428-8" data-blocks='[["BL_428.6",428,[256,1665,1163,258]]]'>In 1847 Susanna came of age, and Rath not having paid or secured any purchase-money either to her or old Hummer, the latter executed a deed to her for the land on the 19th November, 1847, in consideration of $34.53, which it is alleged she paid. Rath was present at the acknowledgment of this deed, and said he had nothing to say against it.</p>
    <p id="b428-9" data-blocks='[["BL_428.7",428,[257,1922,1161,214]]]'>Several other facts are alleged by counsel without contradiction, of which we find no evidence on our paper-books — such as that Rath took a lease from Susanna Leady (now Cullison) — that he abandoned the premises and his wife in 1852, and that she has continued in possession since as Mrs. Cullison’s tenant.</p>

The articles still subsisting — the possession maintained under them — the payments fully made according to them — no chancellor would have decreed a surrender or reconveyance on proof of a contract which a statute forbad to be enforced.</p>
    <p id="b429-6" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[182,902,1162,385]]]'>But there is no likeness between that case and this. Here the action is by the vendee, or one claiming under him, against those holding the legal title of the vendor, and in possession under that title. Here there was no payment of purchase-money — a voluntary destruction of the articles of agreement and an express acquiescence on the part of the vendee in the sale and conveyance of the vendor’s title to a third party who paid a valuable consideration, and that before the creditors of the vendee acquired any lien against him.</p>

C. R. </em>429, that the evidence in such cases is good only as a defence to a bill for specific performance, but is totally inadmissible, at law or equity, as a ground to compel performance in specie.</p>

It was not the case of a fraudulent concealment or conveyance of a- debtor’s property, but the debtor, after he gave up his articles, had no interest in respect of which his creditors could be defrauded. What boots it then that the conveyance to Susanna was attended with the declarations and the motives imputed in the bill of exceptions ? It was a valid conveyance by a real owner to a <em>Iona fide </em>purchaser for a valuable consideration, and neither Rath nor his creditors had any such relation to the subject-matter as entitled them to impeach it.</p>
