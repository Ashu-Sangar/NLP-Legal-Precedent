But it is also the object of the law of evidence to ascertain the truth, and therefore the distinct admission of a fact in a letter or in conversation, is not to be excluded because it is accompanied by an offer to compromise the suit. <em>Proposals </em>made while the compromise is on the carpet, do not bind, but conversations in which <em>a fact is disclosed </em>may be admitted to prove it: Deloquy <em>v. </em>Rentoul, 2 <em>Mart. Lou. Rep. </em>175; Sanbern <em>v. </em>Neilson, <a href="/nh/3/0501-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 N.H. 501" data-case-ids="6755557" data-case-paths="/nh/3/0501-01">3 <em>N. H.

In the case before us, the letter received in evidence contained distinct admissions of material facts. Those facts cannot be excluded because the same letter closes with an offer of a certain sum of money to settle the matter. If the plaintiff in error had confined his objection to the closing paragraph containing the offer of “ a note at four months for $120 to settle the matter,” it is probable that the objection would have been sustained. But he objected to the whole letter, and the court was right'in overruling his objection.</p>
