Is there anything in the policy of the law which calls for a different construction to be put upon this devise ? It is said that this devise creates an estate tail in Ann under the rule in Shelly’s Case. But it is admitted that would defeat the intention of the testatrix. It was her intention that the children of Ann should -take a <em>fee simple </em>as purchasers, and this can only be carried out by holding Ann’s estate to be for life. If <em>fee </em>tail, it would go to the heir at common law in exclusion of her other children. When there is a general and particular intent, the courts will construe it, if possible, to give effect to both; if this cannot be done, effect will be given to the general intent, although the particular intent be thereby subverted. The particular intent here is, that Ann shall have a life estate; the general, that her children shall have a <em>fee simple </em>after her death. The case of Findlay <em>v. </em>Riddle, <a href="/binn/3/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Binn. 139" data-case-ids="1791096" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0139-01">3 <em>Binn. </em>139</a>, it is submitted, rules this case.

The only difference is in the words “as <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>tenants in common,” which simply show that it was intended all the children should take. In the present, the intent is clear that <em>all </em>the children of Ann should take as tenants in common, in <em>fee simple, </em>at her death. A reference to the bequest of the residue throws light on this devise. The interest is to be paid to Ann B. Taylor <em>during her life, if </em>she leave no <em>issue, to </em>go to the <em>children </em>of her sister, Rebecca Baker, and if any of them be leaving <em>heirs, </em>their shares to be divided between said <em>heirs.” </em>She uses the word “ <em>heirs” </em>in the distribution, of the personal estate in precisely the same sense she uses the word “ <em>children,” </em>in the devise of the real estate.</p>

And very commonly the old system is altered and -amended, either by custom or by legislation, in its most prominent parts, -without any adequate attempt being made to adapt the alterations to the minor portions of the system which are properly related to them; and in this way the system becomes seriously complicated in some of its parts.

But with us it would, in logical consequence from our law of descents, have passed to all lineal descendants, according to our law of equality among children. Not being thus treated, it necessarily becomes an element of disorder and confusion. Along with devises and conveyances to a person and his heirs generally, or <em>his </em>lineal heirs in the male or female line, this special kind of estates and assurances was fully confirmed by the statute <em>de donis conditionalibus.</em>

And as the rule has a double aspect, we may divide it into two. Then the first one may be thus expressed: a devise to one for life, with remainder to his heirs, creates a fee simple.- The law so treats it, because it is substantially so, and sets aside the apparent intention to make two estates out of it. And the second one may be thus expressed: a devise to one for life, with remainder to the heirs general or special of his body, creates a fee tail, general or special.

In almost all such cases, the sons, daughters, children, or issue that are to take, are to be ascertained at the death of the first taker. If, therefore, the devise be to A. for life, with remainder to his eldest son and his heirs general or special, or to his children and their heirs, &amp;c., then it must be treated in one of these two modes. The eldest son or the children must take either as purchaser from the devisor, or as heirs of their ancestor. But generally they are, not living at the time of the devise, and are left to be ascertained at the death of the ancestor, and not until then can the grant take effect in their favour. If, therefore, the eldest son or the children are to take as purchasers, and should die before their parent, they would take nothing, and of consequence, no children or grandchildren of theirs could take under such a devise, for no one can take as heir, that which his ancestor never owned.</p>

In some instances the subsequent takers are described as issue, and then the literal interpretation would be that all descendants, children, grandchildren, &amp;c., living at the death of their ancestor, should take together and equally; which, as an interpretation of intention, would be much less probable than that to which the laws of lineal descent direct us. And in many cases the word issue is unaccompanied by superadded words of inheritance, and if regarded as a word of purchase, the result (until lately) would have been a mere life estate. But that word may be used as one of inheritance, and when it is so used, the children inherit fees, either general or special.</p>

Now, plain as is the principle intended to be expressed by the rule, it has not been found simple in its application, even in England, where it was better adapted in its form to their rules of real property, than it is here.

      <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>Our old statutes of descent provided only for the descent of land which the decedent could dispose of by deed or will, and estates tail did not then fall within that category. But the Act of 1799 changed this, and allowed estates tail to be sold and conveyed by deed in a very simple form. Therefore the new law of intestates of 1833, expressly includes such estates, because it declares the line of descent of all land which the decedent might have sold in his lifetime, or disposed of by will.</p>
    <p id="b106-6" data-blocks='[["BL_106.4",106,[263,761,1162,344]]]'>2. Our statute of wills, passed on the same day with the intestate law, and one of its supplements (6th May, 1844), provides for a lineal descent, in order to prevent a devise to a child, or to a brother or sister, if there is no child, from lapsing by the death of the devisee in the lifetime of the testator; and in such case the descent goes according to our law of lineal descents, on the supposition that such is the testator’s intention; that is, on the principle of entailment until it vests.</p>
    <p id="b106-7" data-blocks='[["BL_106.5",106,[264,1103,1162,164]]]'>It may also be worthy of notice, that the decisions in relation to contingent remainders tend in the same direction, in order to keep them from falling by the particular estate enduring beyond the life of the remainder-man.</p>
    <p id="b106-8" data-blocks='[["BL_106.6",106,[264,1275,1160,247]]]'>3. The judicial adoption of the English law of primogeniture in estates tail, has entirely ceased to have any support in our laws and customs, and is now plainly incompatible with them all. Therefore, we can no longer presume, from general words of entailment, that a lineal descent according to the English law is intended.</p>
    <p id="b106-9" data-blocks='[["BL_106.7",106,[266,1531,1163,345]]]'>4. This principle would make our law on this subject, perfectly simple and homogeneous, and we might hope to have wills of this character easily interpreted by the parties or their counsel, without the necessity that now exists, of always resorting to the courts for an authoritative interpretation of them, before making or accepting a title, under them. It may be thought that, since the Act of 1855, converting entails thereafter created, into fees simple, this principle can he of very little use.</p>
    <p id="ACb" data-blocks='[["BL_106.8",106,[266,1876,1161,214]]]'>But this estimate of it may change, when it-is considered that, for a very long time to come, the old forms of wills and. conveyances will continue to be used, and will require interpretation, and that most of the wills involving these questions, written since 1833, yet remain to be interpreted.</p>
    <p id="b106-11" data-blocks='[["BL_106.9",106,[267,2090,1165,298]]]'>And under this principle, the rule of interpretation that favours the heir in doubtful cases, would be differently applied, even to the same language, depending upon the question of the form of the lineal descent. We incline in favour of an estate tail, if it is to descend to all the children equally, because that is in exact accordance with our laws of lineal descent, and with our customary modes of thinking.</p>

The purpose of that act is to convert words of entailment in estates thereafter created, into words of general inheritance in fee. It repeals the statute <em>de donis eonditionalibus.</em>

    <p id="b107-6" data-blocks='[["BL_107.4",107,[150,588,1163,172]]]'>Though this will was written before the act was passed, yet it did not take effect by the testator’s death, until some months afterwards. It was therefore created after the law, and must be governed by it.</p>

And interpretation must of course read it as of the time when it was written; but a law would, and does apply to the will, irrespective of intention, .and takes hold of it only when it goes into effect. Then the question arises, would this will create an estate tail independently of the Act of 1855 ?</p>

We have used the term heirs of the body where the testatrix used only the word heirs, because her use of the word issue as a synonym, shows this to be her meaning. She means that it shall go to Ann’s lineal heirs, if she has any, and if not, then over. It is very evident that they are to take "the remainder, not as persons selected out of the number of her lineal descendants, but as the lineal descendants of every degree from the first taker, and according to our law of descents, and therefore under the rule in Shelly’s Case, they take an estate tail: <em>Fearne </em>188.</p>

It is supposed that it is not an estate tail, because the devise over is on a definite failure of issue, that is, in default of issue living at the death of the first taker.

An estate tail has but one life’s duration, if the donee dies without leaving issue at his death; hut it is not shortened by the fact of there being a limitation over on that condition. A fee is converted <em>by implication </em>into an e.ntail, by a subsequent limitation over on an indefinite failure of issue. But if the limitation over be on default of issue at death, no such implication can arise, and the limitation over merely reduces the fee to a conditional one: <em>Smith, </em>§§ 128, 584, 649; 2 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. </em>324; <a href="/binn/2/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="35" data-cite="2 Binn. 455" data-case-ids="1788935" data-case-paths="/binn/2/0455-01">2 <em>Binn. </em>455</a>; 1 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>144; 3 <em><a href="/binn/2/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="2 Binn. 455" data-case-ids="1788935" data-case-paths="/binn/2/0455-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/binn/2/0455-01" class="citation" data-index="36" data-cite="2 Binn. 455" data-case-ids="1788935" data-case-paths="/binn/2/0455-01">487</a>, <em>n.; </em><a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20450" class="citation" data-index="37" data-cite="9 Watts 450">9 <em>Watts </em>450</a>; <a href="/watts-serg/7/0288-01" class="citation" data-index="38" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 288" data-case-ids="481740" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0288-01">7 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>288</a>.
