But the facts offered would justify the conclusion that the plaintiff adopted anchratified the acts of Fisher. Agency is founded upon a contract <em>express </em>or <em>implied. </em>It may be created by deed or -writing, or verbally; and it may also he inferred from the relation of the parties: Ewing <em>v. </em>Tees, <a href="/binn/1/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Binn. 450" data-case-ids="1787951" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0450-01">1 <em>Binn. </em>450</a>; McConnel <em>v. </em>Wright, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Johns.%20Ch.%20667" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Johns.

Coombs, 7 <em>Barr </em>546. The question here is whether the plaintiff is not bound by the acts of Fisher, who <em>professed to act as his agent, </em>he being informed of it, and having done or said nothing for more than six years to repudiate these acts: Brigham <em>v. </em>Peters, 1 <em>Gray’s Mass. Rep. </em>139.

Whether the statute is a bar to the recovery of the dividend of $600, declared in October, 1849. The only fact upon which the supposed ratification rests is plaintiff’s <em>silence. </em>No <em>act </em>is pretended. The subscription was made 16th December, 1848. No dividend was declared until October, 1849. Up till that time there was no assent of Cowell. If Fisher paid for this stock, then the company cannot retain the dividends to repay Fisher. This must he settled between Fisher and Cowell. If he did not pay for it, then the silence of Cowell, from December, 1848, to October, 1849, was clear evidence that he did not intend to accept of it. It is submitted that the silence of Mr. Oowell is conclusive proof that he never recognised the act of Fisher; it is certain that he gave no previous authority. Fisher’s letter to plaintiff, of 16th December, 1848, could only have advised him of the subscription, not of the application of the dividends, for they all accrued subsequently; and of their application plaintiff appears to have received no notice till November, 1855. The agent acting without authority would hind himself individually. Whether he could recover from Mr. Cowell is a question with which the company have nothing to do. There is no pretence that he was informed of the application of these dividends. If they were applied by order of Fisher, some authority in him to do so should be shown.</p>

The Act of 6th March, 1847, § 2, requires all companies incorporated under any law of this state, to publish a true and accurate statement of all dividends not called for within three years; and if not demanded within three years after such publication, to pay them into the treasury, to be paid over to the rightful owner whenever he may demand them: <em>Dunlap </em>973. In case <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>the required publication is omitted, the 3d section subjects the company to a penalty of twelve per cent, per annum on all such dividends, from the day on which they have been declared <em>until paid.</em>

It is not ratification of itself, but only evidence of it to go to the jury along with all the circumstances that stand in immediate <a id="p337" href="#p337" data-label="337" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*337</a>connexion with it. Among these, the prior relations of the parties are very important. If the party to be charged had been accustomed to contract through the agency of the individual assuming to act for him — or had intrusted property to his keeping — or if he were a child or servant, partner or factor, the relation, <em>conjunctions favor, </em>would make silence strong evidence of assent.</p>

If mental assent may be inferred from circumstances, silence may indicate it as well as words or deeds. To say that silence is no evidence of it, is to say there can be no implied ratification of an unauthorized act — or at the least to tie up the possibility of ratification to the accident of prior relations. Neither reason nor authority justifies such a conclusion. A man who sees what has been done in his name and for his benefit, even by an intermeddler, has the same power to ratify and confirm it that he would have to make a similar contract for himself, and if the power to ratify he conceded to him, the fact of ratification must be provable by the ordinary means.</p>

I am aware that Livermore cites with approbation, p. 50, the opinion of civil law writers, that where a volunteer has officiously interfered in the affairs of another person, and made a contract for him without any colour of authority, such other person is not bound to answer a letter from the intermeddler, informing him of the contract made in his name, nor is- his silence to be construed into ratification. But it is to be remembered that such writers are not laying down a rule of evidence to govern trials by jury, but are declaring rather the effect upon the judicial mind of the party’s silence. It is one thing to say that the law will not imply a ratification from silence, and a very different thing to say that silence. is a circumstance from <a id="p338" href="#p338" data-label="338" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*338</a>which, with others, a jury may imply it. Because evidence does not raise a presumption so violent as to force itself upon the judge as a conclusion of law, is the evidence therefore incompetent to go to a jury as ground for a conclusion of fact ? No writer with a common law jury before his eyes, has ever maintained the affirmative of this proposition. If it could be established it would abolish that institution entirely, and refer every question and all evidence to the judicial conscience.</p>
    <p id="b338-6" data-blocks='[["BL_338.4",338,[329,775,1157,721]]]'>But it is time now to remark that this case is far from being that of a mere volunteer or intermeddler. True it is that Mr. Fisher had not any proper authority to make the new subscription, but Messrs. Binney and Biddle, the friends and correspondents of the plaintiff, had consulted him in reference to the plaintiff’s interests in this railroad company, and as a director of the company he stood in some sort as a representative and trustee of the plaintiff, who was in a foreign country, and without any authorized agent here. The proposition that every stockholder should subscribe new stock to the extent of 10 per cent, was designed, and as the event proved, was well designed, to , retrieve the fortunes of the company, but it was necessary to its success that every stockholder should come into the arrangement. The emergency was pressing, and Mr. Fisher, manifestly acting in perfect good faith, made the subscription for the plaintiff, which he believed the plaintiff would not hesitate to make if personally present.</p>
    <p id="A9b" data-blocks='[["BL_338.5",338,[331,1503,1159,901]]]'>When the plaintiff was fully informed that a sagacious financier, to whom his chosen friends and correspondents had referred his interests, and who stood in the fiduciary relation of a director, had pledged him for a new subscription, which circumstances seemed to justify and demand, I say not that he was bound by it, nor even that he was bound to repudiate it, but that his delay for near seven years either to approve or repudiate, was a fact fit to be considered by a jury on the question of ratification. The subscription was made in the plaintiff’s name, and accepted by the company as his, and it does not appear that they knew Fisher was acting without authority. The offer was to show that it was highly beneficial to the plaintiff. It was then such an act as is capable in law of being ratified. The plaintiff might make it his own by adoption. Did he adopt it? He did if he ever gave it mental assent. How could the company show assent by anything short of a written agreement, if not by evidence of the nature of that in the bill of exception ? The medium of proof, where a mental purpose' is the object of inquiry, must conform to the mode of'manifestation. To say that you may prove assent, but may not give the circumstances in evidence from which it is to be implied, is to say nothing.</p>
