Philadelphia, for seven aider-men, in pursuance of the Acts of Assembly in such ease made and provided. The ward is divided into six precincts, and an election was held in each, the original returns of which were filed in the <a id="p10" href="#p10" data-label="10" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*10</a>prothonotary’s office of the Court of Common Pleas. At this election there were nine candidates voted for, among whom were the respondent and ITenry Wynkoop. The judges and inspectors of the several precincts in the ward met on the day after the election and cast up the votes for the respective candidates, and made out and signed a certificate of the result. In that certificate they certify that William Garrigues, the defendant, received seven hundred and thirty-eight votes, and Henry Wynkoop received seven hundred and thirty-six votes. This certificate was returned and filed in the office of the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas, and likewise transmitted to and filed in the office of the secretary of the Commonwealth. Hereupon the governor of the Commonwealth issued commissions to the seven persons appearing by said return to have received the highest number of votes. The number of votes appearing to have been cast for Garrigues were less than those cast for either of the other six to whom commissions were issued. By the several returns from the respective precincts, as separately returned to the office of the prothonotary, and there aggregated, it appeared tha.t the number of votes cast for Garrigues was seven hundred and <em>twenty-eight, </em>instead of seven hundred and <em>thirty-eight, </em>as contained in the general return and certificate. And the number cast for Wynkoop was seven hundred and thirty-six — the same as contained in the general return. It was therefore alleged on the part of the Commonwealth that there was an error or mistake in casting up the returns, and that Wynkoop was elected by a majority of <em>eight votes </em>over Garrigues. And this <em>quo warranto </em>was brought to oust Garrigues from the office of alderman, which it was alleged he wrongfully usurped, and to place Wynkoop therein, to which it was alleged he was legally elected.</p>

It would not have been reversed by <em>quo warranto, </em>or by any other collateral proceeding. Even a <em>certiorari </em>would only draw into review in this court the regularity of the proceedings, without reaching the merits of the case as disclosed in the evidence. On the merits the judgment of the Common Pleas, by the terms of the Act of 1854, is final and irreversible. In addition to the provisions of the statute to this effect, the principle of the common law produces the same result. It is the interest of the public that <a id="p12" href="#p12" data-label="12" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*12</a>there should be au end to contention. Justice to the parties requires that no one should be twice vexed for the same cause. For these reasons the general rule of the common law has been established, that no judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction can be re-examined in a collateral proceeding. If the election had been contested in the manner prescribed by the statute, the decree of the Common Pleas could not have been re-examined in this form of action. Can the Commonwealth gain any advantage by disregarding the requirements of the statute ? The Act of 1806 furnishes an answer to this question. The remedy prescribed by the statute must be pursued.</p>
    <p id="b12-6" data-blocks='[["BL_12.4",12,[320,891,1163,808]]]'>But it is argued that the Commonwealth is not bound by the statute. It is true that the general rule in England is that the king is not bound by a statute if he be not named in it. But this rule has many exceptions. All statutes made to suppress wrong, to take away fraud, to prevent the decay of religion, to prevent tortious usurpations, or to secure to electors the right to make free election, are excepted out of this rule in England, and bind the king although he be not named: 5 <em>Coke’s Rep. </em>14 b; <em>Dwarris on </em>Statutes, 27, 28. The Act of 1854 comes within the spirit of several of these exceptions. In addition to this, the subject-matter, being one in which the Commonwealth is the chief party in interest, plainly indicates an intention to bind the state. If this were not the construction, the statute would be almost inoperative. It is therefore our opinion that the remedy prescribed by the Act of 1854 excludes all other remedies for matters which might have been investigated in the form prescribed by that act. It is not necessary to determine how far this statute binds Henry Wynkoop. He is not a party to this suit. He has carefully avoided becoming the relator, or in any way making himself liable for costs.</p>

If it did, it is repealed by the Act of 1854, so far as the former is repugnant to the provisions of the act last mentioned.</p>
