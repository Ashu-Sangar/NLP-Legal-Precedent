It may be transferred like other choses in action, and paid to the person who shall present the certificate, but an endorser in blank is not held on his naked endorsement, nor, as we suppose, could the endorser sue the bank in his own name. The instrument appears from the decision to have none of the incidents of a negotiable promissory note. The principles of the case are since recognised in Charnley <em>v. </em>Dulles, 8 <em>W. S. </em>361, per Sergeant, Justice, and in Gillespie <em>v. </em>Mather, 10 <em>Barr </em>34, per Bell, Justice, and have never been shaken by any other judicial decision in this state. It is true that we have a contrary doctrine laid down by the Supreme Court of the United States in Miller <em>v. </em>Austin, 13 <em>Noiuard </em>218 (not cited in the argument), where the question arose under a statute of the state of Ohio, very similar in terms to that of 3 &amp; 4 Anne in force in Pennsylvania.

In the courts where the decision in 13 <em>Howard </em>is to have the weight of authority, our Pennsylvania case, and those following in its wake, must be considered as overruled, but is nevertheless binding on us as an inferior court. The Supreme Court of the United States is not to declare the law for the state of Pennsylvania, except in those cases where their authority is made binding by the constitution and laws of the United States. On a question of general jurisprudence their decisions are entitled to no more weight than those of our sister states, and as that court is at present constituted, with me would have much less than those of Massachusetts or New York; for although the judges are more numerous, they certainly are not more noted for sound judgment, or legal acumen, but in both particulars fall greatly behind the superior courts of either of the states named, or of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. Taking the decision in Patterson <em>v. </em>Poindexter as binding on us, in what particular does it differ from that under consideration ?</p>

In the former a definite time is fixed for payment ; it is made payable twelve months after date; it is made <em>payable </em>only to R. Patterson &amp; Co., <em>or their </em>order, upon the return of the certificate. In the latter it is certified that Miller has deposited in this bank $440, <em>subject </em>to his order, <em>payable </em>only on the return of this certificate. No other time is given than the return of the certificate. It is due presently, if at all; but the money is left in the bank <em>subject </em>to the order of Miller. There is no promise to pay him except such as might be raised by <em>implication; </em>for the word <em>‘payable,’ </em>as here used, is not put in the form of a promise to pay to Miller or his order, but to pay on the return of the certificate — or rather it is a declaration that the money left by Miller is payable on the return of the certificate. This paper, in the early history of the law, would never have been considered a promissory note; I think would not now be so deemed in England, either under their stamp acts or the statutes of Anne, defining what shall be a negotiable promissory note; but would be considered a mere certificate of the deposit or bailment of a sum of money with the bank by Miller, subject to be drawn out by him, or on his order; but for the safety of the bank is only payable when the certificate is returned. It is in the nature of a special contract — is an obligation <em>sui generis </em>— and as a means of obtaining credit or raising money in distant places by the holder is of modern invention, differs most essentially from a bill of exchange, which was well known to the common law, and is not a promissory note within the statutes, consequently is not negotiable paper in the state of Pennsylvania. It follows as a corollary that Drexel &amp; Co. and Mr. Gleim took it subject to the <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>legal claims against Miller, and that it was bound by the attachment issued and served by the plaintiff before its endorsement. The bank therefore paid it in its own wrong, and must account for it to the attaching creditor. The transfer of the paper, after Miller knew of the attachment, was a fraud on the law, and the payment by the bank with full knowledge by its officers of such fraud, was a violation of their duty. They should have suspended payment until the right was determined.</p>

The court has no power over the person of the defendant to oblige him to give over his promissory note to any one. In very many cases he cannot be served with the execution attachment, owing to- his absence from the county; and, if served, although his debt is attached, his person is free: <em>Us pendens </em>is not notice as there decided. It follows that if the paper is negotiable, and transferred to a <em>bona fide </em>holder after attachment and notice thereof on the defendant in the judgment, such holder will be entitled to collect the note. In the present case, the debt attached not being evidenced by a negotiable promissory note or bill of exchange, we must give judgment in favour of the attaching creditor and against the Lebanon Bank for the amount admitted to be due to the defendants by the answers to the interrogatories.</p>

After the attachment, and after Miller had notice of it, he endorsed the certificate over to Drexel &amp; Co. This, endorsement was evidently made for the purpose of defrauding the creditor, and in contempt of the law and its process. Whether Drexel &amp; Co. had notice of the facts, or what they paid for the certificate, if anything, does not appear by any evidence except the endorsement. The bank, with full notice that the endorsement was made after the money was attached in their hands, paid it to the agent of Drexel &amp; Co. The court below was of opinion that this payment was no defence against the plaintiff in the attachment. The case, turned on the question whether such a certificate of deposit was a negotiable instrument. The negative of this question has been three times decided by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania: Patterson <em>v. </em>Poindexter, <a href="/watts-serg/6/0227-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 227" data-case-ids="480102" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0227-01">6 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>227</a>; Charnley <em>v. </em>Dulles, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20361" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 361">8 <em>W. </em>&amp; <em>S. </em>361</a>; Boker <em>v. </em>Hazard, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20228" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 228">6 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>228</a>. It was not pretended by any one that the instrument was a bill of exchange. It was contended that it was a promissory note. But the decisions proceeded on the principle that a promissory note could not exist without an <em>express </em>and <em>unconditional </em>promise to pay. The certificate of deposit was destitute of both these requisites. The money was merely stated to be “ <em>subject </em>to the order” of Miller. The promise to pay was, therefore, only an implied one, arising from the facts set forth in the certificate. It was subject to the order of Miller only on “the return of the certificate.” An unconditional draft, without returning the certificate, would not have entitled the payee to the money, according to the terms of the instrument. It was, therefore, payable only on a condition. But it is not our purpose to vindicate the decisions of our predecessors on this subject. It is sufficient for us to know that the question has been finally settled by the only authority which can be regarded as conclusive in this state.</p>

But this question does not arise upon the construction of the constitution or laws of the United States; the case before that court was a certificate of deposit issued by a bank in Mississippi, and endorsed in Ohio. The action was brought in the latter state, not upon the certificate, but upon the endorsement. Every endorsement is treated as a new and substantive contract, and is governed by the law of the place where the endorsement is made: Slocum <em>v. </em>Pomroy, <a href="/us/10/0221-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="6 Cranch 221" data-case-ids="530411" data-case-paths="/us/10/0221-01">6 <em>Cranch </em>221</a>; <em>Story Confl.

Conceding this to be a correct exposition of the law of Ohio, it furnishes no reason whatever for a change in the settled laws and usages of this state. If each state is constantly changing its rules of decision for the purpose of conforming to those of its sister states, it might happen that by the time we had accommodated ourselves to the law of Ohio, that state, influenced by the like comity, might have adopted our rule, and thus the law would be rendered uncertain in both states. But it is remarkable that a decision of the Supreme Court of Ohio, in exact conformity with the Pennsylvania decisions, was cited in the argument, and the learned judge who delivered the opinion of the Federal Court did not undertake to show that the citation was erroneous, or that the decision had been overruled by the proper tribunal of Ohio. It is, therefore, by no means certain that the case of Miller <em>v. </em>Austin is even a correct declaration of the law of Ohio. It is very certain, however, that it is no authority on this question, in opposition to the decisions of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania.</p>

When a principle of Pennsylvania law has been settled by the Supreme Court of the state, it is not to be changed in order to conform to the laws of other states.</p>
