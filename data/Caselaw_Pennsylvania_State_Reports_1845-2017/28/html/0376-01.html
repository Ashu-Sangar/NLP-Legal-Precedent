K. Witman and A. Grcisinger his executors, who took upon themselves the trust, and filed an account in August, 1847. Upon this auditors were appointed, and the report filed and confirmed in February, 1848. Among the assets of the estate included in the <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>account, was a Dond of $1800, due the testator from one Sassaman, and a note against another of the name of Clymer for $125. which were unpaid. On the day after the report of the audito was confirmed, the guardians of the five children of the testato-' gave a release to the executors for the Sassaman bond, naming h as worth $1875, obligating themselves, at the same time, t( pay to the widow the interest on $1000, during life, bequeatheo to her by the will of her husband, and after her death the principal sum to the children named in the will. In June, 1848, th( guardians for their respective wards executed releases under sea; to the executors for their respective shares of the balance in the hands of the executors, viz., $36 to each ward, being $180 to the five children. By the report of the auditor, the balance found in the hands of the executors, after crediting them with the Sassaman bond at $1800, and the Clymer note at $125, was $129.98. On the 30th January, 1849, one of the guardians presented his petition in the nature of a bill of review, to which the executors filed an answer, exhibiting the releases from the guardians, and averring that the amount then paid to the guardians was the full amount in their hands. This bill, after argument, was dismissed by the court. On the 11th May, 1853, another guardian filed a petition for a citation on the executors to settle an account of the moneys received since the filing of the former account. The executors answered the citation, alleging that they had fully accounted, and interposing the releases of the guardians; and also the former application for a review, and the dismissing of the same by the court, as a bar to the present proceeding. After argument on the .petition, answer, and replication, the court appointed Nathan Miller, Esq., as an examiner to report the facts. By the evidence returned, it appeared that Clymer, in April, 1848, paid the balance due on his note with interest, amounting to $131.25.</p>
