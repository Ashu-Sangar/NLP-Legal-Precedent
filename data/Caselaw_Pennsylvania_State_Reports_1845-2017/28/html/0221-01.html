On the 10th day of June, 1848, the parties entered into a written agreement by which the plaintiff agreed to furnish to the defendants the necessary fixtures and machinery for a paper-mill which they were about to build at New Alexandria, in Westmoreland county. The different parts of the machinery, with the kinds and sizes, were specified in the agreement. The plaintiff bound “ himself to do all the above work in the best manner and composed of the best materials;” “ and to have the whole work complete and put into operation on or before the 1st day of January, 1849.” For which, the defendants agreed to pay him the sum of five thousand three hundred dollars, which was to cover all extra charges. There was also this stipulation: “ When the work is completed and put into operation, it is to run one month on trial; and if at the expiration of that time it renders satisfaction and proves to be in every respect such as is described and specified in this agreement, then at the expiration of this time, the balance in full, due to the said Gavit, shall be paid by the said Snodgrass, Reed &amp; Co., except the sum of one thousand dollars, for which the said firm are to give their note, payable six months after date, to the order of the said Nelson Gavit, at Philadelphia.” The defendants, if the plaintiff required it, were to pay a proportion of the money as the work progressed, for which he was to give approved security. The agreement concluded with the following clause :—</p>

Such were the cases cited in the argument. But such is not this case. The parties here, instead of designating an umpire, agreed simply that all misunderstandings or difficulties should be submitted to the judgment of three arbitrators, to be mutually chosen, whose decision should be final. The arbitrators were to be <em>mutually </em>chosen; but if this could not be — if the debtor party would not choose — was he to keep his creditor at bay, for want of a tribunal authorized to say that he should pay ? Certainly not. Such an executory stipulation for submission might be waived by the parties. And if the defendant had not waived it, why did he not show when sued upon the agreement, that he had offered to choose referees, and that it was the plaintiff’s fault they were not mutually chosen ? It was as much the defendant’s duty to take steps to constitute the arbitration, as it was the plaintiff’s; and in the absence of evidence that he had done, or had offered to do anything on the subject, the inference was a fair one that the indefinite submission mentioned in the articles had been waived, and each party left to his full rights, both of attack and defence.</p>
