These payments were thus secured by the said Jacob Crouse at the time he purchased the greater part of the land, a small portion of it having been subsequently purchased, and not being subject to this lien. By arrangement made with the parties in interest at the time of Jacob Crouse’s purchase, it was intended this lien should remain undisturbed during the life of Mrs. Williams, the principal being part of the purchase-money. Besides this lien, the land was subject to the lien of a prior judgment to Benjamin Griffith for $1000, and a judgment subsequent to the Williams mortgage, in favour of Hester Kirkpatrick, entered May 17, 1855, on a bond with warrant of attorney, dated March 14,1855, conditioned for the payment of $300 on the —— day of March, 1856.</p>

On the first-mentioned judgment, Stanley issued a <em>fi. fa. </em>December 17, 1855, under which certain personal property of the defendant, including <a id="p141" href="#p141" data-label="141" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*141</a>some liay, straw, &amp;c., mentioned in the article of agreement as sold to Levi H.

Stanley received from the sale of the personal property $144,77, besides costs. Under the same <em>fi. fa. </em>the land of Jacob Grouse, sold by the above-mentioned articles, was levied on and condemned.
