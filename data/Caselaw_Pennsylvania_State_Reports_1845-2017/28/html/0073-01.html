And for cause of demurrer show: First, That if the said marriage settlement had never been made, the .complainant would have had no interest, legal or equitable, in the said real estate, for the reason that as an alien he would have been incapable of taking or holding as a tenant by the curtesy. And for the further reason that the only estate of the said Marianne Lady Whichcote therein, was under a trust for her separate use, not admitting of tenancy by the . curtesy. In the portion of the said real estate, of which under the will the rents are subject to the order and direction of Henry Becket during his life, the interposition of this equitable life estate would prevent the complainant from taking an estate by the curtesy at the death of Henry Becket. Secondly, That under the marriage articles, the complainant could not take or acquire any interest, for life or otherwise, unless the said articles had been carried into effect or confirmed in the lifetime of his wife, by a subsequent proper assurance made by himself and wife, and acknowledged by her according to the statutes in that behalf, and no such assurance was alleged to have been made at any time.</p>

That the eldest son, if any, of the intended marriage, was to he provided for out of his own estate, from which the said Lady Whichcote was to receive a jointure. And that for this, the equivalent was the settlement of her fortune upon the younger children in expectancy, with no reservation except that of an allowance to her for pin-money during the marriage, and a surviving interest to her for life. That the covenant by her uncle stood in the place of the performance by her of which she might be incapable on account of her minority: but that the complainant was bound by the articles from their date as to the personal estate as fully as if she had been of full age, or had afterward confirmed them.

They cannot affirm part and disaffirm the rest. If they disaffirm at all the plaintiff will take the personalty as legal successor of his wife, whatever may become of the realty. The articles are not void, for the husband is bound. They can be avoided only by a complete disaffirming act on the other side, and none such is intended. The articles of marriage settlement are therefore the law of the husband’s rights relative to his wife’s estate, real and personal.</p>
