    <p class="summary" id="b149-13" data-blocks='[["BL_149.11",149,[152,1439,1183,816]]]'>These were two actions of trespass <em>quare clausum </em>fregit, brought by Andrew Hance against John B. McCoy. The plaintiff and defendant are owners of adjoining tracts of land, the plaintiff’s lying west and the defendant’s east of the division line between them. On this division line each of the owners and oc- ■ cupants made and kept each different parts of the fence. In April, 1855, it became necessary for Hance to take up and reset his part.of the fence, which was of posts and rails. The defendant alleged that, in so doing, he had moved the fence over and encroached upon his land several feet. He accordingly, after giving the. plaintiff notice to remove it, and he refusing, tore up the fence and threw it over on the plaintiff’s land. The plaintiff • afterwards put the fence up again, either exactly or nearly so in the same place as before, when it was again tom up by the defendant. And for these alleged injuries these actions of trespass were brought. The deeds and surveys. of the parties called for a straight line between them; the fence, as claimed by plaintiff, was not entirely so, but varied a few feet at different points from a straight line.</p>

      <a id="p150" href="#p150" data-label="150" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*150</a>The material part of the charge of the court below (Haines, P. J.) was as follows :—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b150-6" data-blocks='[["BL_150.4",150,[269,490,1169,557]]]'>“ While the landmarks at the end of the line are not fully acknowledged, and there are no distinct marks along the line, yet in many instances the fence, if there be one, on a line, is a clear, consistent, and distinct mark, indicative of the line, as though acknowledged by the parties, and of far more importance than courses and distances in a deed. Hence, I affirm the first point of the plaintiff as follows: £ A division fence of more than twenty-one years’ standing, although crooked, constitutes the <em>line </em>between adjacent landowners, even though the deeds of both parties call for'a straight line between acknowledged landmarks.’ This is true,' for the reason that the fence is an evidence of acknowledgment by the landowners of the line for a period of time sufficient to raise the presumption of a grant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b150-7" data-blocks='[["BL_150.5",150,[261,1046,1172,769]]]'>“ The law applicable to this case is well settled, and cannot be better defined than in the words of Judge Huston, in the case of Martz <em>v. </em>Hartley: <em>‘ </em>After the lapse of many years, line trees are not found, and nobody who knows anything about it expects to find them. Trees die as well as men; are liable to wind and fire; and, like men, are sometimes maliciously destroyed; the line as used and established by consent, as designated by fences, seen and acknowledged by both parties,- the admission of a fact, as that a corner stood at a particular spot, and proof that both parties have admitted it for twenty-one years, is conclusive; so much so, that positive proof, the truth of which all admit, will not move a fence between two fields, which their owners have admitted for twenty-one years- to be a line between them.’ The question then, here, would seem to be whether the fence between them has stood in the same place for twenty-one years. If it has, it marks the line, whether crooked or not, and whether the deeds call for a straight line or not; and neither one or the other of the landowners had the right to pull it down.</p>
