An affidavit of defence setting forth particularly in what the defence consists, may obviate the necessity of giving notice of special matters: Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Hakes.

Two of them, specify that the payment was on account, and the other is merely a receipt for fifty dollars, without anything further. The word account, without saying what account, whether book account or on account of some other claim, does not clearly designate the application of the money. These receipts should have been permitted to go to the jury subject to any explanations which either party could give to aid the jury in determining whether the money mentioned in the receipts had, or had not, been paid on the note in suit.</p>
