    <p class="summary" id="b238-8" data-blocks='[["BL_238.7",238,[271,934,1155,555]]]'>This was an action of trespass, <em>vi et armis, </em>by Henry Ellis against Henry Wilson and Moses Strouse. Strouse recovered a judgment against Ellis in April, 1853, for $99, before a justice of the peace, upon which an execution was issued and put into the hands of Henry Wilson, a constable. Under this execution Wilson levied on two horses, a stage, a sleigh, and some harness, as the property of Ellis. At the time of making the levy, and on the day of sale, Ellis demanded an appraisement, and the benefit of the $300 exemption law. The constable refused to have an appraisement made, but under directions from and being indemnified by Strouse, proceeded and sold the property seized under the execution-. This action was brought to recover damages for the alleged injury.</p>

This action of trespass was brought to recover damages for seizing and selling the property, and the principal question presented for our consideration is: whether trespass is the proper remedy? We are of opinion that trespass will lie.</p>
    <p id="b240-6" data-blocks='[["BL_240.4",240,[269,668,1161,1757]]]'>In some cases an act which was in the first instance lawful, becomes afterwards a trespass <em>ab initio. </em>Here the levy was lawful, but the sale, without an appraisement upon request made, was a.n abuse of the authority contained in the writ to levy and sell; and this abuse rendered the constable a trespasser <em>ab initio. </em>It was not a mere nonfeasance, or negative abuse of the authority; for selling the goods without an appraisement was an act unauthorized, by law, and left the constable in the same situation as though his acts had been illegal from the commencement. Eor where the law has given an authority, it will protect persons from the abuse of the authority, by leaving the abuser in the same situation as though he had acted without any authority: <em>actus legis nemini facit injuriam. </em>The principle first stated has been frequently applied to cases not dissimilar to the present one. “ If J. S., who has distrained a beast damage feasant, afterwards kill or use the beast, he becomes a trespasser <em>ab initio Bac. Ab. </em>B., tit. <em>Trespass, p</em>l. 4. In Ward’s Case, <em>Clayt. </em>44, it was held that a constable who had a warrant of a justice of the peace to search the house of J. S. for stolen goods, and who pulled down the clothes of a bed in which there was a woman and attempted to search under her shift, by this indecent abuse of his authority became a trespasser <em>ab initio. </em>In the Six Carpenters’ Case, it was said, that “ if a man who goes lawfully into an inn, be afterwards guilty*&gt;f an injurious act therein, he becomes a trespasser <em>ah initio, </em>because this is an abuse of his license to enter.” So in Allen <em>v. </em>Crofut, <a href="/wend/5/0506-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="5 Wend. 506" data-case-ids="2145759" data-case-paths="/wend/5/0506-01">5 <em>Wendell </em>506</a>, it was held that when an authority to enter a house is given by law, and the party abuses the license thus obtained, he will be considered a trespasser <em>ab initio; </em>but where the entry is by license, not under legal authority, an unlawful act done after the entry, will not make the entry a trespass. In Sackrider <em>v. </em>McDonald, 10 <em>John. R. </em>253, for impounding cattle taken damage feasant, before the damages were ascertained by two fence viewers, one was held to be a trespasser <em>ab initio. </em>The same rule has been applied to an ofiicer who sold property by process of law before and after the time prescribed by law: <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Pick.%20350" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="14 Pick. 350">14 <em>Pick. </em>350</a>; <a href="/mass/38/0055-01" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="21 Pick. 55" data-case-ids="2047985" data-case-paths="/mass/38/0055-01">21 <em>Pick. </em>55</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Mass.%20388" class="citation" data-index="16" data-cite="7 Mass. 388">7 <em>Mass. </em>388</a>. The principle was recognised by Chief Justice Tilghman in Hazzard <em>v. </em>Israel, <a href="/binn/1/0240-01" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="1 Binn. 240" data-case-ids="1787941" data-case-paths="/binn/1/0240-01">1 <em>Binn. </em>240</a>, and directly applied in Kerr <em>v. </em>Sharp, 14 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>399, where a landlord and his bailiff were held liable in an action of trespass for selling goods distrained for non-payment of rent, without appraisement or notice.</p>
