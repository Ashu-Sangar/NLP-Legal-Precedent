Barto must be presumed to have come upon the note as second endorser, with the expectation and understanding that Manner-back should be first endorser before it should be negotiated.</p>
    <p id="b451-11" data-blocks='[["BL_451.9",451,[130,2030,1166,429]]]'>It was a fraud on Barto, therefore, for Mannerback to endorse below him, and to negotiate the note to Schmeck, without himself assuming the responsibility of a first endorser. And Schmeck took the note with his eyes wide open to the fact that Mannerback was the payee, and could not regularly be second endorser. This was a circumstance sufficient to diseredit the commercial character of the paper, and to put Schmeck upon inquiry for the collateral agreement, which could alone entitle him to charge Barto as first endorser. The defence, therefore, is just as available against Schmeck as it would have been against Mannerback.</p>
