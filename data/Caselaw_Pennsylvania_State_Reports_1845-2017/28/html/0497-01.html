William Stub for some reason having refused to join in executing a deed, Leissbrought an ejectment against them in 1834, for the land. The case was tried on the 11th January, 1838, and a verdict and judgment passed therein in favour of the plaintiff. During the trial, Leiss paid into court the purchase-money, amounting to $13,040.53. And on the 13th August, 1838, William Stub, as one of the executors, moved for leave to take out of court <a id="p498" href="#p498" data-label="498" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*498</a>$6520.26, being the one-half of the amount paid in by Leiss. Objection was made to this motion, and on the same day the bond was executed; and on the following day the court made the order, and the money was paid to William Stub, and by him placed in the hands of his counsel, who distributed the greater part of it to the parties entitled under the will. Some years previous to this transaction, the executors had settled their account of the administration of the personal estate of the testator. In that account there was a balance in the hands of the said William Stub. This suit is brought to recover, upon the bond, the shares of the equitable plaintiffs of that balance upon the account.</p>

The body of the bond is in the handwriting of John S. Gibons. In the body of it ‘ Henry Deck’ is filled in by me in my writing. Mr. Gibons. is dead long since. This bond was drawn up and executed on counsel table, at bar of old CourtHouse, in old Court-House. I shall be obliged to recur to paper-book for facts. On reading it over they occur very vividly to my mind. I was in court when this bond was executed. Mr. Gibons was present, so was Mr. Barclay, Mr. Smith, and Mr. Strong. They were in the bar, between the counsel tables. When Gibons applied to take the proceeds of sale out of court, Strong and Smith strenuously resisted the application; Strong alleging that William Stub was an unsafe depository for so much money, and required him to give security before it was adjudged to him. These gentlemen and George Forrer and William Stub were all present, and within hearing of what was going on about the bond. Gibons drew the bond in name of William Stub and George Forrer, leaving a blank for the other name. Henry Deck was sent for, the matter explained to him, he assented to becoming bail, I filled in his name, and he and Forrer then signed. Strong and Smith requested security for this money before William Stub should be allowed to take it out of court. There was an objection by Forrel- and Deck to go bail at the time, unless the money was paid into my hands, and it was so paid, and I distributed pretty nearly the whole of it among the heirs. This, I believe, was the only matter then before the court. It- was particularly explained by me to Forrer.”</p>

Smith and Strong were at east counsel table, but in area between the two tables. Court in session. I presume other business was done that day. The bond was written a day or two before it was executed, and Mr. Deck was sent for. This transaction took place when the bond was executed. The bond was not executed in my office; neither of the obligors signed the bond in my office; my office was then in the recess of Bourbon’s hotel.
