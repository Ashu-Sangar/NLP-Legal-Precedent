The declarations contained the common counts. The plaintiff claimed to recover contribution of a moiety of the amount of a promissory note made by Eli Steckel, and endorsed by the plaintiff and defendant for the accommodation of the maker. The note was as follow's: \u2014 \u25a0\n\u201c$600 Allentown, July 16th, 1852.\nNinety days after date, T promise to pay, at the Easton Bank, to the order of Solomon Steckel and Peter Steckel, six hundred dollars, without defalcation, for value received.\nCredit the drawer Eli Steckel.\u201d\nSolomon Steckel P. Steckel\nEndorsed \u201c Solomon Steckel.\nP. Steckel.\n\u201c I guaranty to the Easton Bank the payment of the within note, July 26th, 1852.\nWilliam IP. Blumer.\u201d\nThe note was protested at the Easton Bank for non-payment, on the 16th October, 1852.\nBlumer took up the note, paying the amount to the bank, on the 22d February, 1853.\nIt was in evidence that Peter Steckel requested a witness to ask Solomon Steckel to pay the note and that he would repay him his part; and that the witness communicated this to Solomon the plaintiff. That the plaintiff afterwards furnished the money, and the witness, at his request, paid it over to Blumer, and lifted the note.\nEli Steckel was a son of Solomon, and kept a hotel in Allentown, and failed in business in the fall of 1852. He gave to Solomon a note for $1500, with a warrant of attorney to confess judgment, and which was entered on the 23d October, 1852. The witness who wrote the note could not tell whether this claim was included. No part of the judgment was paid by the sale of Eli\u2019s property.\nIt was also proved that Blumer kept an Exchange Office in Allentown, and that a part of the business of the Easton Bank in Lehigh county was done through his office.\nThe defendant contended that the paper showed that Blumer was a guarantor for Eli Steckel, and as such he could not have recovered against the accommodation endorsers; and the payment to him by Solomon Steckel was a voluntary one, and gave him no right to recover against the defendant his co-endorser. That the direction to \u201c credit the drawer\u201d was special, and the endorsement imposed no liability, unless it was shown that Eli got the credit. If it was purchased by.'Blumer he must show that, and then he could only recover the amount paid.\nJudge McCartney, who presided at the trial in the court below, having died before the charge was written out, charged in substance as follows:\u2014\n\u201c What is Blumer\u2019s position ? He guarantied the payment of the note to the Easton Bank, and after dishonour took up the note. He stands in the relation of holder of the paper to the endorsers, and could have sued the endorsers. He could have sued Solomon Steckel.\n\u201c Solomon Steckel took up the paper. Can lie call upon Peter Steckel for contribution ?\n\u201c In Croft v. Moore, 9 Watts 451, two of three joint payees treated the other one as joint surety, and upon payment were subrogated. Solomon Steckel can call upon Peter Steckel for contribution. He whose name is on negotiable paper cannot call upon others to sue, he must take up the paper and sue. The note drawn by Mr. Beese has no operation as an admission of Peter Steckel\u2019s liability, nor of an admission that if Solomon would pay, he, Peter, would contribute. His liability to contribute grows out of his joint endorsement. The note .was in the bank, and did the proceeds go to Eli ? That is a matter of inference; the direction to credit the drawer is evidence that he, Eli, got the money. Was Solomon bound to take care of Peter? No more than Peter was bound to take care of Solomon.\u201d\nThe jury found for the plaintiff. Whereupon the defendant took out this writ and assigned for error, inter alia, the foregoing instructions.\nM. S. Jones, for plaintiff in error.\nA. JS. Broivn, for defendant in error."
