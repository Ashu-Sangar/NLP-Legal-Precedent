Ch. 108">3 Johns. Ch. Rep. 108</a>), the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania was called upon in a case admitting of profound deliberation, to plant itself firmly on one or the other of two principles; either to say that a married woman, with a limitation to her separate use, has all the rights of a <em>feme </em>sole, from which she is not expressly excluded by the instrument creating the estate, or to say that she has only the powers which are expressly given to her by the instrument. After an elaborate discussion both by the counsel and the bench, the latter ground was chosen in Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Rawle%20261" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Rawle 261">1 Rawle 261</a>. The experience of years has served to justify the wisdom of the choice.

Seven years afterwards the point came up in Rogers <em>v. </em>Smith, 4 Barr 93, in which the conclusions of the court are thus stated: “ In this state the rule is clearly established that a <em>feme covert </em>is, in respect to her separate estate, to be deemed a <em>feme sole, </em>only to the extent clearly given by the instrument by which the estate is settled, and has no right of disposition beyond.” See also Thomas <em>v. </em>Folwell, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Whart.%2016" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Whart. 16">2 Whart. 16</a>; Dorrance <em>v. </em>Scott, 3 Id. 309; Lyne <em>v. </em>Crouse, 1 Barr 111. The law on this point had thus been established in Pennsylvania, when the Married Woman’s Act was passed. After the passage of this act, the question occurred whether the principle thus decided was affected by it. It was at first somewhat apprehended that Faries’ Appeal, 11 Harris 29, pointed that way, but the apprehension was groundless.</p>

He found in that act an authority conferred on a married woman to encumber or convey her estate in a mode there pointed out, and he seems to have come to the conclusion that this authority extended over all the estates which a married woman might possess, whether held for her separate use or conveyed to her directly in fee simple, but does not seem to have noticed the distinction taken in The Pennsylvania Company <em>v. </em>Foster, 11 Casey 134; which not only saved the rights of married wopien, but also saved the law from reproach.

Lord Cowper expressed his doubts in Harvey <em>v. </em>Harvey, 1 P. Wms. 125. But the question was settled in the case of Bennett <em>v. </em>Davis, 2 P.

If a trustee is not appointed in the instrument, the court will appoint one whenever it becomes necessary for the protection of the wife’s property, or they will regard the husband as the trustee without making a formal appointment: 2 Story’s Eq. 976, 1059. No case in this state turns on the question whether there was or was not a trustee appointed <em>by </em>the instrument creating the estate to the separate use of a <em>feme covert. </em>Such a distinction could not be sustained on principle or authority. The question is whether the estate in the wife is legal or equitable; that is, whether it is conveyed to her absolutely in fee simple, or whether it is clothed with a use in her favour. If it is given simply to her and her heirs, although she is described as a married woman, the estate is a legal separate estate, and she can convey it unless she is in some way trammelled by the deed conferring it upon her. If the estate is conveyed to her for her separate use, or as in this case to her sole and separate use, free from liability for her husband’s debts, then it is an equitable estate, and if the power to mortgage or to convey be not expressly given by the instrument creating the estate, she has no such power.

It is true Mr. Fleming’s will was proved before, and Mrs. Stewart’s after the Act, of 1848. But it is submitted that Foster’s Case, 11 Casey 134, was not intended to establish a distinction on this ground. That case left the equitable estates of married women just where it found them. The act relates to <a id="p230" href="#p230" data-label="230" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*230</a>legal estates, and not to those estates which are equitable as distinguished from legal. Holding then an estate under each will in trust for her own sole and separate use, of which her husband was in the eye of the law trustee, we submit that she had no power to mortgage under either. If she could not mortgage by virtue of Mr. Fleming’s will, neither could she under Mrs. Stewart’s, for the disability in the latter case is just as clear as in the former. It is true that under Mrs. Stewart’s will she has the power to devise, but the presence of this power, and the absence of all others, is an additional argument against the power to mortgage. She could not mortgage her life estate, for that was in the same manner made subject to her sole and separate use.</p>

By the ancient law, a married woman could alien her lands or bind her interest in them only by fine. In Pennsylvania, by a custom which prevailed before 1770, she could do this by joining with her husband in a deed or mortgage under hand and seal, duly executed. The Act of 1770 only confirmed this right. The Supreme Court first recognised her power to mortgage in the unreported case of Wilson <em>v. </em>The Bank, decided at Chambersburg in 1831.

It placed a married woman in a position which she had never before occupied under any law, divine or human. It was a contradiction in terms to call a <em>married woman </em>a <em>feme sole </em>for any purpose. Worse than all, it deprived her of the very benefit which the act was intended to secure, by permitting her to convey or encumber her property at the caprice of her husband, and thus to place it virtually at his disposal. When the change took place in the bench in 1851, the new court found this decision in the books, and with a natural unwillingness to upturn what had been so recently done by their predecessors, they seem to have endeavoured to modify it, and to bear with it as best they could. After several efforts to this effect, it will be found that in the end they overthrew it utterly. While the rule laid down in Cummings’ Appeal continued in force, it was entirely consistent to hold, as the court did in Black <em>v. </em>Galway, 12 Harris 18, and in Miner <em>v. </em>Graham, 12 Id. 491, that a wife might mortgage her separate estate for her husband’s debt.

The result of this case is, that in Pennsylvania a married woman is not a <em>feme sole </em>but a <em>feme covert, </em>holding property to her separate use, as if it had been settled under a deed of settlement in strict form. In this state of the law the plaintiff came into the court below, with Mrs. Brown’s mortgage in his hands. That is, he presented to the- court her written obligation, under seal, agreeing to be responsible for her husband’s debt, as evidenced by his individual bond, and pledging her separate property for the payment of that debt — for this is the only import of the mortgage. He asked the court by his <em>scire facias </em>— a bill in equity in substance —to aid him by its decree to obtain payment of the debt; in other words, to compel her to perform the agreement contained in the paper which she had executed. Was it ever before supposed that a chancellor would enforce the execution of such an agreement by compelling payment of the money out of a married woman’s estate limited to her separate use ?

Why be allowed by one dash of the pen thus to bind by an encumbrance all her property, of every name and nature ? How is the sheriff to sell the property so mortgaged ?

The other, whether the mortgage in this particular case be in such a form as will bind her estate, being subordinate thereto ? The important inquiry, therefore, is what the character of the estate is which was mortgaged, or sought to have been mortgaged by the plaintiffs ? By the devise in this case the fee simple estate of inheritance is vested in Margaret Brown, who thereby is made the legal and absolute owner of the estate, both at law and in equity. Can it then be narrowed, limited, or restricted by the subsequent clause in the will, which simply expresses the wish of the testator in that respect, when he has previously given and devised the entire fee ? We contend that this, in consistency under our Act of 1833, cannot exist therewith, or be allowed to defeat the character of the estate thus previously given. Mere limitations of power, over an estate that is absolute, amount to <a id="p234" href="#p234" data-label="234" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*234</a>nothing: Wm. Bl. Rep. 672, 698, 700; 4 Casey 89; 7 Harris 41; Id. 369. In this last case the court say “ the law does not pretend to carry out the intention of the testator in all cases, for many testators show a very clear intention to 'shackle the estates granted by them to a degree that is totally incompatible with any real enjoyment of them, and which the law does not allow. Hence many of the l'ulcs of law are designed to control and frustrate the most manifest intent. The great merit of the rule in Shelly’s Case is that it frustrates, and is intended to frustrate, unreasonable restrictions upon titles; for when an estate is declared to be a fee simple or fee tail, it is at once made subject to a limitation in its proper form, no matter how clear may be the testator’s intention to the contrary. And it is entirely ineffectual under the rule that where the primary and secondary intent of the testator are inconsistent with each other, the primary intent shall prevail.” Even' in Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, a similar proviso to that in this will existed, and -without condemnation. Under this will of Robert Fleming there is no trust of any kind created, nor is there occasion for one, there being nothing to conserve.</p>

Taking then the concession of the wife’s power to mortgage with the exception, how is the exception contended for sustained? Not by the Act of 1848, for it makes no distinction between present or antecedent debts of the husband. It is simply declarative of the mode to be adopted for the disposition of the wife’s estate, when the husband seeks to encumber it with her consent. Nor by any of the decisions of our court of final review. From none of them can plaintiffs even catch a glimmer of disapprobation. On the contrary, it might be argued from one of them at least, White’s Appeal, 12 Casey 134, that the use of a wife’s securities for future loans to the husband, was what was viewed reprehensibly, and not for past or present loans or indebtedness.</p>

In Haines <em>v. </em>Ellis, 12 Harris 253, this court decreed a conveyance by a married woman of her estate, as separately hers, and no more so than Mrs. Brown’s. In Black <em>v. </em>Galway, 12 Harris 18, they also sustained a mortgage, since the Act of 1848, by a married woman of her separate estate for the <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>debt of her husband, and this too with a proviso clause for <em>scire facias. </em>In Miner <em>v. </em>Graham, 12 Harris 491, <em>they </em>sustained a mortgage, executed in 1851 by a husband and wife, of the estate of the wife for a debt of the husband. So also in Lytle’s Appeal, 12 Casey 131, a deed of assignment reciting a mortgage, general in form as to real and personal property, was sustained. Plaintiffs have grouped together a number of cases in supposed support of the restrictive clause in the will, as quoted by them. But it is respectfully submitted to the court that none of these affect our case. Holdship <em>v. </em>Patterson was a case in which the debtor “was a purchaser of his own maintenance and no more, and he was a purchaser of a thing so inseparable from his person that it could not be reft from it by an execution.” Ashurst <em>v. </em>Gowen rests upon the same doctrine. Eyrick <em>v. </em>Hetrick decides several questions : one that a life estate ivas not the subject of a bargain and sale. Williams <em>v. </em>Leech does not help plaintiffs, for in that the court decided .that the restraint employed by testator was rather paternal than legal. And in Brown <em>v. </em>Williamson, no beneficial interest passed to the son which ivas liable to execution for his debts. So it will be found that the other class of cases invoked by plaintiffs, all being the sole acts of married women, are inapplicable to this case, as is instanced by Stoops <em>v. </em>Blackford, where a married woman sought to assign a mortgage for her husband’s debts, without his joining in the instrument. In Glyde <em>v. </em>Keister, a bond of a married woman for necessaries was held void. In Heugh <em>v. </em>Jones, the attempt was to enforce a promissory note given by a married woman. In Pettit <em>v. </em>Metz, this court held that a married woman is not empowered by the Act of 1848 to dispose of or charge her separate estate by an instrument under seal, to which her husband is not a party. In Bear’s Adm’rs. <em>v. </em>Bear, that the Act does not enable a married woman to contract with her husband for the repayment of money advanced by him for the improvement of her separate estate.

How is the case different under the will of Mrs. Jane Stewart ? In Todd’s Appeal, 12 Harris 429, it is held that <em>the </em>separate estate of a married woman means an estate held by somebody in trust for her; and not an estate, the legal title to which is in herself. So in Chaffee <em>v. </em>Risk, 12 Harris 432, a trust is where the legal estate is in one person, and the equitable interest is in another. Again, in Kay <em>v. </em>Scates, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%2039" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="1 Wright 39">1 Wright 39</a>. It need not bo said that a trust is to be sustained because the gift is for their sole and separate use. In Rush <em>v. </em>Lewis, 9 Harris 76, if it had not been made the duty of the trustee to receive and pay over the profits to the first taker of the beneficial interest, they never would have had an estate in it. By this will of Mrs. Stewart, no trust is <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>created and no trustee appointed. Therefore it is not affected by Foster’s Case, 11 Casey 134. Where are the same elements of a trust estate under Mrs. Stewart’s will, existing in Foster’s Case, so as to subject Mrs. Brown’s estate to the principle 'of equity, that the wife has no power over the trust estate that is not expressed in the instrument by which the trust is created ? The plaintiffs have failed to establish such a trust, and we argue none such exists. Whether any, and what, lamentable or deplorable consequences may result to a wife from mortgaging her estate, either for her own or her husband’s debts, is but collateral to this inquiry, as the very opposite results may and do occur, and the peace, prosperity, and happiness of herself, husband, and family are in the main secured. One thing is quite clear— the defendant obtained .both the check and the mortgage fairly and legally, as appears by the case stated. What the minutiae of the whole transaction wore, was not deemed essential by either side in the preparation of their case for the decision of the court below. Shorn of extraneous circumstances, the legal questions only are. arrayed broadly against us, and their solution will relieve the case from all false theories. But the form of the mortgage is objected to as being too general. As yet it has only been recorded in the county of Philadelphia, and is alono a lien against whatever estate Mrs. Brown may own in that county. The results depicted by plaintiffs in their argument cannot be said of this mortgage. If the contents were made known to her, as certified to by the magistrate, she certainly knew, by the very terms of the mortgage, that her uncle and sister’s estates, as devised to her, were the subject of the mortgage. It is certainly not more general than that in both Lytle’s and White’s Appeals, 12 Casey. Nor is it in the least shaken by the case of 7 Harris 77. There no writ was issued, and no service of process, and in the agreement waiving the writ in the judgment, and in its revival, no land is described. Hence the learned judge said the only thing that can be made out of such a judgment is that something, or which is the same thing, nothing, is to be sold to pay the debt. Here the writ duly issued, the process was legally served, and the record below sets forth minutely the mortgage, its date, record, time of record, amount, and names of parties. It would be a novel doctrine if plaintiffs’ position is sound that a judgment on the <em>scire facias sur mortgage </em>in this case would be totally fruitless, solely because of the too general terms of the mortgage. The same might be said of all general judgments. Still conceding, arguendo, however, that the <em>levari facias </em>must follow the desci’iption contained in the <em>seire facias, </em>the judgment in the <em>scire facias </em>is a judgment in effect that the plaintiffs should have execution of all the properties in the writ mentioned, and those mentioned are the properties devised by the two wills <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>recited in the mortgage and <em>scire facias </em>writ. The sale of each and all, when set forth, is a matter over which the court issuing the process has a discretionary and controlling power, to be exercised when the exigence arises.</p>

The gift was expressly to the.sole and separate use of the devisee, and the husband was also excluded by the provisions that the property should be free from any of his debts, contracts, engagements, or liabilities. It was' not the less a separate estate because the gift was made without the intervention of a trustee. That is wholly unimportant. The wife’s interest is the same, whether the gift is to her directly or to a trustee for her. It does not depend upon the formal mode in which the gift has been made. At law she can hold no separate estate in lands; such an estate is recognised only in equity. And if lands be given to her separate use, and no trustee be named, a court of equity will convert the husband into a trustee for her. This is too firmly settled to admit of question. See Clancy on Married Women 256, and cases collected in Hare &amp; Wallace’s Notes to White &amp; Tudor’s Leading Cases in Equity, Vol. 1, p. 414. It has often been so ruled in this state. And as the wife’s interest in her separate estate is not affected by the fact that there is no trustee named in the instrument creating her estate, as it is the same in such a case as it would be had there been a trustee named, there is no reason why her powers, incident merely to ownership of the estate, should be greater in one case than in the other. The deed or will which settles the property to her separate use, may give powers which, without it, do not belong to the ownership of a separate estate; but the nomination of a trustee is neither an enlargement, nor is it restrictive, of her power over the property.</p>

This was the rule laid down in Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, <a href="/rawle/1/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="1 Rawle 231" data-case-ids="1819262" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0231-01">1 Rawle 231</a>, and it was unflinchingly adhered to in numerous cases, certainly until after the passage of the Act of 1848 ; and it has been maintained ever since, unless Haines <em>v. </em>Ellis, 12 Harris 253, was a departure. In The Pennsylvania Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Foster, 11 Casey 134, it was reiterated, and that in view of the provisions of the Act of 1848, which were regarded as defining a different separate estate in a wife from an equitable separate estate created by a conveyance to her separate use. True, there was no trustee named in the first of these cases, and there was in <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>the second; but that, as we have seen, can have nothing to do ■with the wife’s power of disposition of the estate granted. Now the very purpose in making a settlement to the separate use of the wife, is to exclude the husband. “ But,” as was well said by Gibson, C. J., in Thomas <em>v. </em>Folwell, <a href="/whart/2/0011-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="2 Whart. 11" data-case-ids="1830593" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0011-01">2 Whart. 11</a>, “to exclude his direct control, which consists in an exercise of legal power, and yet leave him the means of giving effect to an indirect control, which consists in an exercise of personal influence, is to do nothing.’* He added: “ The modern doctrine of courts of equity is founded on what appears to be a misconception of the leading purposes of a settlement, which is obviously to disable the husband, and not to enable the wife, at least further than may be consistent with the security of her title, of which the grantor ought, in the particular case, to be the judge. The object is not so much to give her the dominion of a <em>feme </em>sole, which every man of experience knows would, in a countless number of instances, defeat the principal intent, as to withdraw the estate from the dominion of the husband.” Similar observations have been made by others, and they are most just. All experience proves that the highest protection of the wife against her husband is in her disability, in her want of power to yield to his solicitations, or give way to her sympathies. It was knowledge of this which led to the adoption of the rule in Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, rather than its opposite ivhich prevailed in some other states. Now, it would be strange indeed, if the Act of 1848 has taken away from the wife any of that protection of her separate property against her husband which she enjoyed before its enactment. It was because it was thought she had not protection enough, that the act was passed. Her separate property was secure. She had no other power over that than the donor had chosen to give her expressly. If the deed or will which made the settlement gave her no power of alienation, no solicitation of the husband, no practice upon her affection or her fear, could avail to enable him to obtain control of the estate settled to her separate use. But her legal pstate, whether acquired before or after marriage, was all unprotected. Of this, her chose in possession became absolutely his; he succeeded to her dominion over her choses in action, and to the legal ownership of the use of her realty during life. This was the supposed mischief for which the legislature undertook to provide a remedy, not by taking away the wife’s security for her equitable separate estate, but by making her legal estate, that which her husband could reach, inaccessible to him, by converting it into what was denominated in Pennsylvania Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Foster, a legal separate estate. It was, perhaps, not surprising, that the same sympathy for the wife which led to the passage of the act, should find its way into the courts, and receive expression in Cummings’ Appeal, <a id="p240" href="#p240" data-label="240" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*240</a><a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20272" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="1 Jones 272">1 Jones 272</a>, in which it was held that “ a married woman must hereafter be considered a <em>feme sole </em>in regard to any estate, of whatever name or sort, owned by her before marriage, or which shall accrue to her during coverture, by will, descent, deed of conveyance, or otherwise.” It was soon, however, discovered that such a construction of the act would defeat the object which the legislature had in view in passing it, and Cummings’ Appeal was overruled. It was while the doctrine of that case stood unchanged, that Haines <em>v. </em>Ellis was- decided. The true meaning of the act had not been ascertained, and it was misunderstood. Standing by the broad language used in Cummings’ Appeal, the court said of a deed to a married woman for her sole and separate use, that “ it gave her precisely the same estate which any conveyance in the ordinary form of a deed in fee simple would give since the Act of 1848.” There is no trust created. There is no • trustee appointed, nor is there any occasion for one. There is no restriction imposed by the conveyance upon her right to sell. It is not the case of a power, but of an interest. It w'as for these reasons ruled that she might convey. Certainly, however, unless the Act of 1848 caused a change, a deed to a married woman for her separate use, does create a trust, though no trustee be named, and it is restrictive of the wife’s power to sell or mortgage. On that subject, silence is prohibition; and it is plain that the Act of 1848 has no reference to the form or effect of a deed or will. It touches only the effects of the marriage relation. It does not undertake to say that what was a trust before its passage is a trust no longer, or to make that a legal estate which before was merely equitable. The truth is, Haines <em>v. </em>Ellis is not consistent with the doctrine asserted in the later case, The Pennsylvania Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Foster, 11 Casey 134. There is no substantial difference between a trust implied from the separate nature of the use declared, and one expressly given in trust for a separate use; and if, as was held in the case in 11 Casey, the latter is not affected by the Act of 1848, the former cannot be.' With much force was it remarked by- the learned judge of the District Court, that “ even if the estate of the <em>feme covert </em>in Haines <em>v. </em>Ellis was merely legal, we should still be at a loss to distinguish that case from The Pennsylvania Insurance Co. <em>v. </em>Foster, or to give any sufficient reason why the trust in the latter should not have been governed by the rule laid down in the former. The equitable estates and interests of married women cannot be withdrawn from the operation of the Act of 1848 for one purpose, without withdrawing them for all, and depriving them of the protection which that act was meant to afford. If trusts are not within the enabling power which Haines <em>v. </em>Ellis ascribes to that act, as it regards the wife, it cannot be within its disabling operation on <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>the husband, and he may still exercise the same control over them as before the act was passed, in plain contravention of its general scope and meaning.”</p>
    <p id="b241-4" data-blocks='[["BL_241.4",241,[181,527,1166,472]]]'>In fine, we have no doubt the ease of The Pennsylvania Insurance Company <em>v. </em>Foster was well decided; that the Act of 1848 has no reference to estates settled to the separate use of married women, whether a trustee be named in the deed of settlement or not, and that in both cases married women have no power of alienation beyond suchas are expressly given in the instruments by which the estates are created. Haines <em>v. </em>Ellis is not a correct enunciation of the law. And as neither by the will of Mr. Fleming nor by that of Mrs. Stewart, was any power conferred upon Mrs. Brown to mortgage her separate estate, her mortgage to the plaintiff was unauthorized and void.</p>
