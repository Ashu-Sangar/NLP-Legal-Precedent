This act was repealed by the Act of 21st April 1846, Purd. 366, which, besides prescribing a rule for future cases, enacted that in all actions tried since 5th May 1841, wherein, by verdict or confession of judgment, time became essential, the defendant should have two years, after the passage of this act, to pay his money, commence his action, and enforce his contract.</p>

    <p id="b476-10" data-blocks='[["BL_476.8",476,[291,1689,1165,466]]]'>But the language of the clause is criticised. It is said it relates only to actions “ tried” since 5th May 1841, and therefore cannot be applied to this confession of judgment. The phraseology is, with customary looseness, <em>“ </em>actions tried since 5th May 1841, wherein by the finding of the jury, or <em>by confession of judgment by the </em>defendant,” from which it is evident the legislature meant to prescribe a rule for judgments confessed in equitable ejectments, where time became essence, as well as for judgments entered on verdicts.
