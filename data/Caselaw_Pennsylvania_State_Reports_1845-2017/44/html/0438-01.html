Although the clause of the statute, required only the day of the month and year to be indicated, yet it expressly declared, that it should bind the property of the defendant from <em>the time the writ should come into his hands. </em>This necessarily fixed the order of priority of writs in the application of the proceeds of sale. The first writ which bound the goods or chattels of a defendant was to be first paid. Such was the rule under the statute of Charles 2. See Watson on Sheriffs 176.</p>

The sheriff is by this act required to endorse the day and hour in which he receives an execution. This was Avhat he did in obedience to the practice under the Act of 1772. But to do so, is directory under the Act of 1836. What if it be not entered by the sheriff? Is the creditor, for this omission of the officer, to be postponed, and turned round to a suit against the sheriff? This would be vexatious to both the creditor and sheriff, and not only occasion delay to a party who was in no default, but Avould give a technical and inequitable advantage to a junior execution, Avhereon the time is endorsed. When the sheriff does note the precise time of the receipt of the Avrit, it is doubtless conclusive. But if he omit to do so, parol proof of it is not obnoxious to the objection that it contradicts the return on the writ. Nor is the entry, even when made, a record. So it is not the case of an attempt to supply a record by parol: <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20203" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Watts 203">2 Watts 203</a>.</p>
