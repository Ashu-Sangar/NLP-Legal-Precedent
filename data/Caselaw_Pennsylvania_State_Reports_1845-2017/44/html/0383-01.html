The actual amount of money received by him was $4467.50, to secure which and the monthly payments of one dollar per share on his stock, he gave the mortgage on which the action is brought. The mortgage is dated March 24th, a. ». 1854. Defendant has paid to the association, monthly dues and interest amounting to the sum of $3076.81.'

His share of these expenses amounts to $132. The counsel for the plaintiff in error says he is not, because the premiums, fines, and profits or re-loans, none of which Avere paid by the plaintiff in error, but all of which were paid by other stockholders, are more than sufficient to pay all expenses. But this court has decided, in Philanthropic Building Association <em>v. </em>McKnight, 11 Casey 470, that these premiums, fines, and profits belong to the stockholders paying them, and can be recovered back by them in an action against the association.</p>
    <p id="b385-6" data-blocks='[["BL_385.6",385,[181,882,1161,375]]]'>The association is therefore liable to the stockholders who paid these premiums, fines, &amp;c., for repayment of them, and they cannot be said to be profits from which the expenses of the association are to be paid. Whilst the court properly holds these associations to a very strict account in their dealings with their stockholders, it Avill not permit a retiring stockholder to take advantage of his own wrong, and to inflict upon the remaining stockholders the whole burden of the expenses of the association.</p>

Though, as a mortgagor, he could not be compelled to pay more than the sum actually borroAved by him, with legal interest thereon; it Avas only as a member that he could claim a share of the profits of the company, or any benefit from payments made by others. If he may now set off against his mortgage a share of the profits made equal to the liability which he has incurred for expenses, he will, in effect, recover more than he has paid in, and Avill throw upon his associates the whole of a burden, Avhich in truth is his as much as their-s. This cannot be. The association has a right to treat his payments while his membership continued, as his contribution, so far as they were needed, to the discharge of the expenses incurred in the management of the enterprise, in Avhich he had a joint interest with others. Nor has he now any title to the premiums and fines paid by other borrowers. The judgment was therefore right.</p>
