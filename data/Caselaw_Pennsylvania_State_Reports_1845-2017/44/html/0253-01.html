The defendant in the original judgment, Thomas C. Jones, was a competent witness (McCormac <em>v. </em>Hancock, 2 Barr 310), and his evidence and that of other witnesses established the fact that the account was strictly and exclusively an agency account, composed entirely of moneys of other persons for whom he was acting as a collecting agent, and that no money of his own w'as deposited in that account. Upon this state of facts, it is clear the plaintiffs were not entitled to recover, as it would have been taking the moneys of other people to pay the defendant’s own debt, with which they had no concern.</p>
