But that if the sale was not <em>bond fide, </em>if it left the property in the father, and the son acquired none, but the transaction Avas intended to hinder and delay the creditors, then the levy would be such a one as the creditors had a right to make — srich a one as was contemplated in the policy, and such a one as Avould avoid it.</p>

The policy was to cease when the property insured should be “ levied on or taken into possession or custody under an execution or other proceeding at law or equityand we do not think that this expression covers a case of trespass in which'the property is wrongfully seized as the property of a stranger.</p>
    <p id="b243-8" data-blocks='[["BL_243.9",243,[242,1039,1162,377]]]'>Properly speaking, a levy “under” any process is a levy in pursuance of the authority given by it, and an execution against one man never gives authority to levy on the goods of another. The levy in this case was not therefore properly “under” any process. And we discover no valid reason for extending this provision to the case of a wrongful levy. To do so would be to attribute to every levy that is valid in form the effect of avoiding a policy, though such levy should be invalid in substance, and should have endured but an hour.</p>
