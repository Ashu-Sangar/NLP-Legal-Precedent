We do not think so. Summerville admitted Robert’s authority by entering into the submission with him and trying what he could gain by it, and rues only when he fails, and then it is too- late to rue. Besides, the cases are <em>several, </em>and therefore the submission must be treated so, and is binding for this case if not for the other.
