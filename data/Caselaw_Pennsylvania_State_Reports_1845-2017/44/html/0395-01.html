In the judgments of Ney and Stichter &amp; McKnight there were no waivers. A <em>fi.fa. </em>was issued on Ney’s judgment to April Term 1861, No. 135, on which the real estate of the defendant was condemned, A rule being granted, the inquisition was subsequently set aside by the court for irregularity. Pending the rule, a writ <em>de inebrietate inquirendo </em>was issued, and the defendant, Joseph Laucks, duly found by inquisition, to be an habitual drunkard, and having a wife and three minor children. On confirmation of the inquisition by the court, Adam Kauffman was appointed as his committee. An <em>al. fi. fa. </em>was then issued on the judgment of Daniel K. Ney to January Term 1862, No. 92, in which the defendant, by his committee before inquisition held, claimed the benefit of the Exemption Law, and the appraisers found the property could not be divided so as to set off a part to the defendant, and appraised the same at $350. A <em>vend. exp. </em>was subsequently issued on the Ney <em>fi.fa., </em>and the real estate sold for $330.70, besides costs.</p>

In Shelby’s Appeal, 12 Casey 373, the waiver was in the body of the judgment, and this was treated as having the effect of a waiver on or after execution. In Garrett &amp; Martin’s Appeal, 8 Casey 162, we did not pass upon the effect of such a waiver, as it was not in the case, but the question on that point is now settled by Shelby’s Appeal.</p>
    <p id="b396-16" data-blocks='[["BL_396.18",396,[314,1249,1164,469]]]'>In several cases it has been held that the debtor shall not convert his privilege to claim the benefit of the Exemption Law into a mode of preferring creditors : “ That a debtor cannot waive his right to the $300, in favour of a junior lien-creditor.” That whatever he does not regularly claim for himself, remains in the fund to be distributed according to law: Boyer’s Appeal, 9 Harris 210; Garrett &amp; Martin’s Appeal, 8 Casey 160; Shelby’s Appeal, 12 Id. 373. McAfooose’s Appeal has not the slightest bearing on this doctrine. All that was decided there, was that when one claimed the exemption on a <em>fi. fa., </em>he was not obliged to reassert it on an <em>alian vend,, </em>for the sale of the premises.</p>
    <p id="b396-17" data-blocks='[["BL_396.19",396,[314,1720,1164,205]]]'>The facts in this case bring it exactly within the rule of the cases just cited.
