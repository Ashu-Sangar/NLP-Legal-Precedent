The other cases were continued, with a general' understanding that they would abide the result in this case, in which it was supposed the questions of law involved in the cases would be settled. The defendant in this case pleaded in defence several matters touching the regularity and legality of the proceedings, and also offered evidence to show that his property was not benefited by the construction of the sewer. To the admission of this evidence the plaintiff objected, but the court admitted it, and sealed a bill of exceptions. The court then instructed the jury, <em>pro </em>forma, against the defendant on all the points raised, but reserved them as questions of law, and submitted to the jury, as a question of fact under the evidence, whether the defendant’s property was benefited by the construction of said sewér. The jury found for the defendant on this question of fact. The only point, therefore, brought up by this record was, whether the court erred in admitting the defendant’s evidence to show that his property was not benefited by the said sewer.</p>

Previous to the construction of the sewer, his surface-water flowed down an alley in the rear of his property to Cherry alley, and thence along Cherry alley to the Monongahela river. Since the sewer has been built the water from his lot flows in the same way, except that it enters the sewer at Third street, and thence flows in the sewer to the river.

The opinion contains a clear exposition of the legislative action and judicial decisions of these tribunals from the earliest period of their history. This policy was undoubtedly derived from England, as established by the Bill of Sewers of <a href="/citations/?q=23%20H.%208" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="23 H. 8">23 H. 8</a>, ch. 5, where it is called a tax, and under which and subsequent acts, all persons w'hose property derive an advantage may be assessed to the sewers-rate, and the benefit is not required to be immediate, nor do the cases or the statutes say anything of the nature or amount of the benefit.</p>
    <p id="b116-5" data-blocks='[["BL_116.4",116,[291,821,1167,595]]]'>In Pennsylvania a similar system has existed for thirty years in Pittsburgh, as shown by the Acts of Assembly and by decided cases, and we have derived the authority to make such assessments from the taxing power vested in the legislature, which may be exercised in such form and manner as may be directed by law. In McMasters <em>v. </em>Commonwealth, <a href="/watts/3/0292-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Watts 292" data-case-ids="1841304" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0292-01">3 Watts 292</a>, Judge Rogers, adopting the New York decisions, decided such an assessment to be constitutional.

It was distinctly held that such an assessment of benefits upon lots in the vicinity of the extension was eonstitutiQnal, and that the term vicinity did not denote any particular definite distance from the extension of the street. Judge McClure, adopting the doctrine of the New York courts, which he says has been referred to with approbation by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania in various decisions, speaks of the contrary dictum of the case in 6 Barbour, which we have seen has been entirely overruled; and Judge Rogers declares emphatically that “after the repeated decisions of our Supreme Court, the constitutionality of the act is not an open question in this state.”</p>

These requirements were no doubt complied with. The levy and assessment were regularly made, and by an ordinance reciting the same, passed 20th June 1859, the same was \approved by councils. Amongst the persons thus assessed and taxed on property benefited, is' the present defendant in error, who is assessed $33.33 for his house on Fourth streét, which is above where Cherry alley crosses that street, and upon the descent from Grant street to the sewer.</p>

We think he was, for such are the express words of the law, and any other construction would open a door to an entire revision of the whole assessment made by the assessors.
