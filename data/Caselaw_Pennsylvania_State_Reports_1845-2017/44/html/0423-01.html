Mr. Maurice was examined at great length, and, from his testimony, it appeared that he owed the bank rather more at the time of the entry of the judgment of Mr. Forrest, than at present; that he was in the habit of paying the notes that had been discounted for him as they became due, and getting other notes of about the same amounts discounted by the bank at or about the same time to meet these payments. Sometimes he would get a note discounted a few days prior to the maturity of the one falling, due, and at other times, when he had sufficient money in bank to meet the maturing note, he would not get a discount until some days afterward, keeping, however, in the aggregate, his line of discounts very nearly the same. The notes produced by Mr. Maurice showed, during several years, a remarkable regularity and uniformity, the date of each succeeding note approximating very closely in time to the maturity of the prior one, and generally for the same amount. Mr. Maurice said distinctly that he regarded this long series of notes merely as a regular chain of renewals of those originally discounted for him. He, however, stated, with equal distinctness, that all the notes referred to, over one hundred in number, dating from those held by the bank at the time of the entry of Mr. Forrest’s judgment to those now held by the bank inclusive, had been offered by him for discount at the bank on the regular discount days; had been, in the usual manner, discounted for him by the bank, and the proceeds passed to his credit in his bank account; and that the.reason he regarded them as renewals was that he considered <a id="p426" href="#p426" data-label="426" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*426</a>himself always entitled to a certain amount or line of discounts in the bank, from having given the mortgage of $4000 to protect any discounts made or to be made for him.</p>

It did not in terms include renewals. If the notes now held were, in bank language, renewals, we cannot see how they could be in the security, supposing that, under the decision, it became fixed at the date of Mr. Forrest’s judgment. By the very term renewal, in banking and legal language, is meant not another security for an old debt, but a <em>novation </em>or <em>renovation, </em>from time to time, a direct payment and discharge of the old debt, and an entirely new contract and advance. It may possibly be different in some cases as to the parties, maker and payee, but so far as the bank is concerned, in fact and in law, the old notes are surrendered and cancelled, new notes taken, and a new discount in advance charged and deducted from the face of the bill, thus enabling the bank, on a note at sixty days, to receive four-tenths of 1 per cent, more than 'legal interest, besides compounding it as they go along. The bank has never any claim except upon the notes. They do not loan the money and take the notes as collateral; they buy the notes from those who offer them for discount. It was not from any doubt on this point that the issue was directed, but because we felt some difficulty as to whether this was a question of fact, the exceptant having demanded an issue upon it, namely, whether the subsequent notes were merely different'securities for one and the same debt; not what was the intention of the parties, which might be very well on a question as between themselves, but the rights of a third party having intervened, what were the facts ? The verdict of the jury on the issue was what was to be anticipated. The notes now held could not even be shown to be the lawful issue of those originally discounted. Every one of them was illegitimated by breaks in the descent. Besides which, the fact as to the manner in which all banks invariably conducted this business, came out fully and without contradiction on the trial, so that, even had it been shown, Avhich it was not, that the proceeds of the discount of every note had been specifically applied to pay its predecessor, no jury would say, with any show of truth, that they were mere new securities for an old debt.” The substance of the charge to the jury on the trial is stated in the opinion of this court. This appeal was then taken and the writ of error sued out.</p>

Maurice in favour of Edwin Forrest, dated October 22d 1853, payable in one year from date, and the consideration was money loaned. It was referred to an auditor, who reported that the eight notes held by the bank were not renewals of the notes originally discounted by the bank, or of those held by it, at the time of the entry of Mr. Forrest’s judgment. The bank and Mr. Forrest each filed with the auditor a demand for an issue substantially upon the same question, “ whether the notes held by the bank at the time of the sale were renewals of notes held by them at the time of the entry of Forrest’s judgment, and if so, to what amount?” Upon the filing of the auditor’s report exceptions were filed by the bank, and the court granted their demand for an issue.

It is a question of fact. I understand a renewal to be a new security given for a debt due, or falling due, in fact substituting one security for another whether it is the same debt.” “If the securities now held are notes or securities given for the same debt, they are renewals.” Now, this seems to be a correct and comprehensive view of the law, and it is nowhere complained of by the appellants, and the court were clearly right in saying renewal or not was a question of fact, for only in that light could a jury be required to pass upon it. The court affirmed the third, fourth, and fifth points of the plaintiffs, as follows: “ That it is not necessary, in order to one note being a renewal of a former one, that it should be of the same amount, or time to run, or made or endorsed by the same parties; nor that the note given in renewal should be given, or bear date upon the day of the maturity of the fprmer note; and that it need not appear that the identical proceeds of the new note were actually applied to take up the note for which it was a renewal. That a now note may be a renewal of a former one, although the new note passes through the regular course of discount in a bank; in other words, that because a note is discounted, it does not necessarily follow that it is not a renewal of a former note; and that if the jury believe that the several series of notes testified to by William II. Maurice, formed one continuous transaction in the loan of money by the bank to Maurice, of which loan the notes in question are the evidence,,the verdict must be for the plaintiffs, notwithstanding any new note, in any one or more of the series, may have been discounted prior or subsequent to the maturity of the preceding note” — the court adding, “you are to determine whether the notes now held are securities for the same debt.”</p>
    <p id="b430-7" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[371,1969,1168,214]]]'>Now, these instructions are certainly as liberal as the plaintiffs could desire, and unless the debt for which these notes were given existed at the time of the Forrest judgment, it is clear that the mortgagee could not claim to be paid out of the proceeds of the sheriff’s sale in preference to that encumbrance.</p>

This the court properly refused to do, saying, “I do not think it is a question what the parties intended or considered. But what is the fact ? Was it for the same debt ?”</p>
    <p id="b431-6" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[184,737,1167,302]]]'>It will be recollected that there was not a word, either in the written or any other contract, between the bank and Mr. Maurice about renewals at all, and that the rejected questions on the trial and these points were attempts to substitute the opinions and the intentions of the parties for the actual facts; and the court were therefore clearly right in overruling the questions, and in declining so to charge the jury.</p>
    <p id="b431-7" data-blocks='[["BL_431.5",431,[181,1039,1168,342]]]'>The jury gave a verdict for the defendant, the court refused a new trial, dismissed the exceptions, and confirmed the auditor’s report absolutely. We have, therefore, tbe report of an auditor, the finding of a jury, and the deliberate judgment of the court below, that these notes were not renewals, nor given for the debts due, or falling due at the time of the entry of the Forrest judgment; and, upon a careful examination of the whole case, we see no good reason to dissent from this decision.</p>
