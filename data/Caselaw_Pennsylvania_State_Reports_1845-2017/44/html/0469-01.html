He did the business with the plaintiff, so far as appears in paying him what the bank owed him. That he had no right, under the banking law, to transfer him this note without authority from the board of directors, if there was any, may be conceded. That a court of chancery, on the application of the board, or a stockholder, or even a billholder, would have restrained him from doing this, and many other things that were done, there can be but little doubt. But if he was the executive and managing officer of the bank, he had a right, and it was his duty, to pay its creditors. It was the right of the creditor to get his pay if he could. <em>Leges sunt vigilantibus. </em>They mutually chose to give and take this note instead of coin. [There was nothing morally wrong, in the abstract. It was but giving, a preference among creditors. This the law would have prevented by injunction, if applied to.
