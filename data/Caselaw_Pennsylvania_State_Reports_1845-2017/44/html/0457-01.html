Stout, administrators, &amp;c., of Isaac Stout, against Michael Meyers, administrator, &amp;c., of Abraham Stout, deceased, who filed their statement, setting forth that their claim was a bill single of Abraham Stout, dated May 10th 1837, for $379.21, payable to Solomon Bachman <a id="p458" href="#p458" data-label="458" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*458</a>or order, one year after the date thereof, with interest; tnat on the 1st day of April 1838, .Solomon Bachman, the obligee, equitably transferred the same to Isaac Stout; and that on the 1st day of June 1842, the said Solomon Bachman died intestate. January 11th 1858, the case was arbitrated, and resulted in an. award for plaintiffs for $826.68 and costs. At the arbitration, no plea had been entered on the record by defendant, but the case was tried on the statement. The hearing before the arbitrators disclosed the real cause of action to be a bill single, purporting to be signed by Abraham Stout and Isaac Stout, which was produced, accompanied with the allegation that Isaac Stout was surety, that it was paid by him to Solomon Bachman, the obligee, on or about the 1st day of April 1838. The legal and equitable defence then set up -was — 1. That the suit was brought by the wrong party. 2. If the parties were right, the form of action was erroneous. 3. That there was no statutory assignment of the bill single. 4. The Statute of Limitations. 5. Payment; and 6th. A denial of the fact of suretyship and payment by Isaac Stout.</p>

The amended statement set forth circumstantially the plaintiffs’ cause of action, which accorded with his claim as set up before the arbitrators. On the day the amended statement was allowed to be filed, defendant added the pleas of “ <em>non est factum,” </em>“ <em>actio non accrevit infra sex annos,” </em>and <em>“nunquam indebitatus.” </em>Same day, jury were sworn. The plaintiffs demurred to the plea of <em>“actio non accrevit infra sex </em>annosa juror was withdrawn and case continued.

May 14th 1862, plaintiffs, without withdrawing their demurrer to the plea of “ <em>actio non accrevit infra sex annos” </em>to the amended statement, moved — 1.
