Another on the south side of said road, bounded on the north by the factory and factory pond of E. &amp; B. S.

Said Seely made- a will, bearing date the 16th day of October 1850, giving and bequeathing by said will to his two daughters, Chloe Seely and Caroline Seely, among other things, the whole of the lot last above described, and the east half of the lot first above described, being the land in controversy in this suit, to have and to hold the same, and all the profits thereof, during their natural lives ; and after their decease, to their heirs if any they have; and if they die without heirs, then said land should fall to his heirs.

Nor can Chloe Seely claim the portion of land devised by the will of' Julius Seely to her and Caroline Seely, as survivor as joint tenant, because such survivorship is abolished by the Act of Assembly of 31st March 1812: Purd.

If, by the terms of the will, Chloe and Caroline are to be regarded as joint tenants, the right of survivorship may exist, notwithstanding the Act of 31st March 1812, if expressly given. That the act does not apply to an estate given jointly to husband and wife, is held in several cases. See <a href="/watts-serg/8/0107-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="8 Watts &amp; Serg. 107" data-case-ids="483407" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/8/0107-01">8 W. &amp; S. 107</a>; 7 Barr 448; 9 Harris 347; 12 Id. 57. The words “ I bequeath to my two daughters, Chloe and Caroline, the above described land,” would have made them joint tenants, and survivorship would have followed as a legal incident, had the Act of 31st March 1812 not been passed. And in that case, to have added expressly, “ to have and to hold to the survivor of them,” would have been surplusage: Co. Lit. 191 a, note 1. Since the passage of the act, however, those words are not surplusage, but are held to give <em>expressly </em>what was formerly regarded as a mere <em>incident </em>to the estate, and which, existing only as an incident, is cut off by the statute. Though survivorship, as an incident to joint tenancy, was abolished by the Act of 1812, it may be expressly given by will or deed : 2 Harris 57, It is submitted, therefore, whether the words following the sentence quoted above, “ to have and to hold during <em>their </em>natural lives, and after <em>their </em>decease to their heirs (if any they have), and if <em>they </em>die without heirs,” &amp;c., do not raise the right of survivor-ship from an incident to a principle.</p>
    <p id="b436-6" data-blocks='[["BL_436.6",436,[275,1510,1170,897]]]'>It is said in a note, under the Act of 1812, in Purdon, to have been held that the statute does not apply to a “ devise to two jointly for life:” citing <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Phila.%2017" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Phila. 17">2 Phila. Rep. 17</a>. But it is submitted whether the devise may not be regarded as giving an estate for life or in tail to the devisees with cross-remainders, and on default of issue, remainder over to the heirs of the devisor in fee, to be enjoyed by both during the life of both, by the survivor on the death of one, and on the death of both, to pass to the heirs of the devisor in fee. A similar devise was so construed in 12 Harris 57. In Walker <em>v. </em>Dunshee <em>et al., </em><a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20430" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Wright 430">2 Wright 430</a>, the devise ivas “ to my son and the heirs of his body; on default of issue, to my two daughters and the heirs of their bodies, to have and to hold, &amp;c., in equal portions; on default of issue in either, then to the survivor and the heirs of her bodyor in default of such issue, remainder to my right heirs and the right heirs of my wife.” This was held to be “ a devise to the three children in tail, with cross-remainders in tail, with a vested remainder to the right heirs of testator and his wife as tenants in common.” In this case the remainder over is upon the default of issue in Chloe and Caroline. It is not “if either die without issue,” but “if <em>they </em>die AYithout issue.”</p>

It was there held, that it might be <em>expressly </em>created, but where it resulted as an incident from the form of the grant or devise, it was taken away by the act. We make no quarrel with this distinction now, for in this case a joint tenancy is not couched in express terms, so that the case cited, as well as the statute, is against its supposed existence. The court should not therefore have held, that Chloe Seely was entitled by survivor-ship to her deceased sister’s undivided moiety in the premises.</p>

The Act of 1812 turns estates otherwise joint tenancies into tenancies in common, and this sufficiently answers the inquiry without more.
