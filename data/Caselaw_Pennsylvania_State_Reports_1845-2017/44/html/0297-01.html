The estate is in form a remainder for life after the expiration of a precedent estate for life, and therefore one to which the term used by the testator in giving the remainder, to wit, the word.“ grant,” is peculiarly applicable. The word “devise,” as of universal application to all testamentary dispositions of lands or interests therein, may, for the purposes of this investigation,-be rejected as giving no clue to the quantity of estate intended. But the estate, after Malcolm McNeran’s death, is to vest in his heirs as tenants in common; but should he die without issue, then the said property to descend to testator’s surviving heirs. The word “heirs” evidently does not mean heirs general, for it is qualified by the limitation over in the event that grantee die without issue. Does it mean heirs special taking by limitation ?</p>

The case seems to fall within the third proposition, as to the application of the rule in Shelly’s Case, as stated by Mr. Smith in his work on Executory Interests, sec. 479. This case, though within the general proposition, does not fall literally within either the 4th or 5th clauses, in which the word “ heir” is explained, and divested of its usual meaning; sec. 488; but does it not substantially ? There are no superadded words of limitation to the heirs and assigns of the heirs of Malcolm McNeran, nor is the limitation over in the form stated in the 5th clause. The object of the superadded words of limitation and of the limitation over, respectively, however, being only to explain the sense in which the distributive words are to be tajken, it would seem that a general limitation over, except on indefinite failure of issue, should have the same effect as a limitation over, to take effect within or at the end of a given time.</p>
    <p id="b299-11" data-blocks='[["BL_299.11",299,[234,2324,1167,85]],["BL_300.1",300,[297,394,1173,860]]]'>2. Do the words in this will import an indefinite failure of issue ? We find, 1st.

That the time at which the estate is to vest in his “heirs” is fixed as the time of his death. 3d. That such persons as are then to take as heirs, are a class who are to take distributively, and consequently must be ascertained at the time when the estate is to vest in them. The words “but should he die without issue,” although ordinarily words of technical significance, and sufficient of themselves to enlarge an estate for life, into an estate tail, seem in this case to import only the contingency on which a remainder is limited. And this, not only for the reasons heretofore alluded to, but for the additional one that the remainder over is not to the heirs of the testator generally, but to his “ surviving” heirs. Giving every word of this clause then its proper force, and eliminating all that is immaterial to the determination of the quantity of estate that passed to Malcolm McNeran under it, it is submitted that it creates an estate for life in Malcolm McNeran, remainder in fee to his children as tenants in common, and that, by necessary logical deduction, it is brought directly within the ruling of this court in Guthrie’s Appeal, <a href="/wright/1/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Wright 9" data-case-ids="626208" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0009-01">1 Wright 9</a>.</p>

Without the last limitation it would be an estate in fee simple, but that shows that the testator meant by the word “heirs,” “heirs of the body,” when he employed it in the gift of the first remainder. Then what is there to show that he used it as a word of purchase rather than a word of limitation ? Nothing but the direction that the heirs of the tenant for life should take as tenants in common. That, however, has always been held insufficient to overcome the presumption that the testator does not intend the remainder-men to take as the root of a new succession, where he describes them as “heirs” or “heirs of the body,” the technical words of limitations. It is at best equivocal, or, if regarded as repugnant to the gift to heirs as such, why should it prevail over the rational presumption that when a testator uses technical words of limitation, he means to use them in a technical sense, especially when that sense corresponds with common understanding ? Standing alone, as in this case, it never does.</p>

The will gave that to Malcolm McNeran for and during his natural life, with the remainder after his decease to his children, share and share alike: but should he die without issue the direction was that the property should be equally divided among the testator’s surviving heirs. It is plain that the testator intended that the remainder-men should take as purchasers, and not as heirs, unless a contrary intent is deducible from the last clause of the words of gift. He described them by an apt word of purchase, <em>i. e. </em>children, and therefore the first taker had only an estate for life. And the limitation over, on the death of the first taker without issue, can make no difference. Had there been no gift of a remainder to children, the limitation over on the death without issue, would have given him an estate tail by implication, but there having been an intermediate gift of a remainder to children of the devisee, of the particular estate, the gift over on <a id="p303" href="#p303" data-label="303" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*303</a>the death without issue must be construed as a gift on death without <em>such issue </em>as those previously mentioned, to wit, children. That this is the rule, may be seen in the cases collected in large numbers in 2 Jarman on Wills, ch. 40. See also Smith on Executory Interests 576, <em>et seq. </em>See also Mr. Hayes’s second, third, fourth, and fifth rules for ascertaining the effect of a gift over, in default of issue, upon a preceding limitation to one for life, or to one for life with remainder to children, &amp;c.: Hayes on Dispositions of Real Estate 28. It was said on the argument that the devisee for life was unmarried, and without children when the will was made and when the testator die'd. This can make no difference; the gift, was not to the devisee named and his children immediately, but to the children by way of remainder.
