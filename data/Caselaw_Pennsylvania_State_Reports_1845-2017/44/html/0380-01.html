The condition of the bond in suit is “that the goods so levied on and claimed as aforesaid, shall be forthcoming upon the determination of the said issue, to answer the said writ of execution, if the said issue shall be determined in favour of Henry Robinson &amp; Co., or if so many of them shall be forthcoming as shall be determined not to be the property of the said Catharine Wallace, then this obligation to be null and void.” The offer of defendant below was to show that as to a portion of the identical goods embraced in the original inventory, contained in the interpleader, amounting to between three and four hundred dollars in value, they were forthcoming at the determination of the issue, were on the premises of the debtor at the time of the levy under the second execution, wore there at the time of the offer, were abandoned by the sheriff, and were not eloigned. Surely this was competent testimony. The plaintiff in error is not to be held liable, except for default of the debtor or claimant in not bringing forth the goods levied upon at the determination of the issue to answer the writ of execution, and then only <em>pro tanto. </em>Any other meaning would fix the liability totally and unconditionally: See Gibbs <em>v. </em>Bartlett, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%2033" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 33">2 W. &amp; S. 33</a>.</p>

And yet the court below held that the sheriff’s return was conclusive on the surety, and that it was not competent for him to show otherwise, or to traverse the return. See 1 Ld. Raymond 613. Plaintiff in replevin could maintain an action against the sheriff for a false return, if he should persist in a refusal to replevy the <a id="p382" href="#p382" data-label="382" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*382</a>goods, and return eloigned. Would not the same doctrine apply in this case, where the sheriff has made a false return of eloigned, and refused to execute the writ of <em>vend, exponas f </em>And was not the court below in error in refusing to plaintiff in error an opportunity of contradicting the return, and showing the true state of facts existing at the determination of the feigned issue, and at the time of the issuing of the second execution, and the visit of the officer to the premises of the debtor ?</p>

The issue was so determined, and when the sheriff went for the goods they were not forthcoming to answer the writ, and he returned “eloigned.” The condition of the bond was therefore broken. Nothing less than producing to the sheriff all the goods claimed by Catharine Wallace, and producing them to answer the execution, could meet the obligation assumed by the defendant. Neither the sheriff nor the execution-creditors were bound to accept a part, or even the whole of them, unless they were forthcoming to answer the writ of execution. Were it competent then for the obligor in the bond, who has undertaken for the claimant, to contradict the sheriff’s return that the property had been eloigned (which we do not say), it is still plain that the evidence offered in this case could have availed nothing either in bar of the action or as showing a partial discharge. The claimant has interfered with the process of the creditors, and compelled them to let go of goods which had’ been seized to satisfy the debt due them. This she has done without just cause, as the verdict in the inter-pleader issue establishes. She cannot now select such portions of the goods as she chooses, and turn the refuse over to the creditors, and insist that they'shall accept them in partial satisfaction. Much less can she, or the obligor who answers for her' default, claim that the condition of the bond has been fulfilled in <a id="p383" href="#p383" data-label="383" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*383</a>part, when even the refuse of the goods, not consumed or eloigned by her, are not produced to answer the execution. Her cause-loss interference is not to be instrumental in defeating the rights of the creditors. Had she interposed no claim to the property, the whole of it might have been sold, and the proceeds applied to the execution. The present claim of exemption may be a consequence of her claim. Whether it was or not, the evidence offered in court below was rightly rejected, and that without asserting the conclusiveness of the sheriff’s return, or denying the competency of the proposed medium of proof.</p>
