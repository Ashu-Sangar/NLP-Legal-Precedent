This provision was materially changed by the Acts of 1688, 1693, and 1700, which last, as well as those of 1705 and 1710, were repealed in council. Judge Oadwalader, in some valuable remarks on the recording acts, says : “Under the act in the text” (1700), “and those which preceded it, the proof or acknowledgment of deeds was taken in court, and the books in which they were recorded were books of the respective county courts, from whose offices they were afterwards transferred to those of the recorders of deeds. Under the Acts of 1705 and 1710, the acknowledgment or proof of deeds was required to be made before one of the justices, in presence of the recorder who attended on the justice for the purpose.

Looking over about two hundred pages, in the beginning of the book, I find it to contain commissions to the sheriffs’ justices; contracts relating to the purchase and sale of lands; release of liens, and charges upon lands ; declarations of trust; proofs of decedents’ contracts; award of referees; affidavit of death of ancestor; mortgage of chattels; mortgage of lands <em>in Virginia; </em>deeds for lands <em>out of the county ; </em>bonds and warrants, a few; the last six kinds without any legal authority, and one mortgage on land in Philadelphia county, for which I could see no other reason than accident or mistake.</p>
    <p id="b525-10" data-blocks='[["BL_525.8",525,[170,1840,1160,301]]]'>“In speaking with Andrew Miller, Esq., upon the subject, he mentioned that his clerks had, by mistake, recorded a few <em>mortgages </em>in the Deed Book owing to the defeasance not appearing until in the writing it was first discovered, in which cases he made reference at the proper place in the Mortgage Book where the mortgage was copied, and entered it in the Mortgage Index, so as to bring it in the proper line of search.</p>
    <p id="b525-11" data-blocks='[["BL_525.9",525,[170,2142,1159,160]]]'>“ The practice of giving certificates of search stating that it appears by the index, &amp;e., commenced in Alexander McCaraher’s time, about thirty years ago, and the practice has ever since continued.”</p>

Any other construction would render our registry system valueless and impossible.</p>
    <p id="b526-6" data-blocks='[["BL_526.4",526,[306,588,1160,131]]]'>This certificate for two deeds being a mortgage and not recorded in the Mortgage Book, is simply equivalent to an unrecorded mortgage.</p>
    <p id="b526-7" data-blocks='[["BL_526.5",526,[304,717,1162,685]]]'>This detailed examination into the practical working of the recorder’s office has been made necessary by some unguarded language used by Chief Justice Gibson in McLanahan <em>v. </em>Reeside, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20511" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="9 Watts 511">9 Watts 511</a>, upon a point not necessary to the decision of the case before the court. He had decided that an absolute deed, recorded in a deed book, followed afterwards by a defeasance recorded in the same book, was not a sufficient recording as a mortgage, because, upon reaching the absolute conveyance, he was not bound to go farther. “ It is indeed,” says the chief justice, “ of no account that the conveyance and the articles were not recorded in the book set aside for mortgages. The keeping of such a book is an arrangement to promote the convenience of the officer by contracting the surface over which he is to search for a particular thing; and he is bound to furnish precise information, get it as he may, of every registry in his office, whether made in the right place or not.”</p>
    <p id="b526-8" data-blocks='[["BL_526.6",526,[303,1401,1162,730]]]'>This was undoubtedly said without a full knowledge of the uniform practice to the contrary, and of the entire impossibility of carrying on the registry of deeds and mortgages in a populous county like Philadelphia, and deriving any practical benefit from it. To search twelve different species of books, covering very numerous volumes, devoted, all but one species, to entirely different subjects, for a stray mortgage which should be found only in its appropriate place, -would be to stop all the transfers of real estate, which are of daily occurrence. Ño recorder could or would undertake it, and no body of clerks wrould be sufficient to carry on the work of the office. The advice of Mr. Price, in his work on Limitation and Lions, page 348, is most apposite : — “ It behooves the mortgagee not only to take his mortgage in proper form, but to have it duly recorded in- the Mortgage Book.’1’ A caution most necessary in such a nondescript certificate for two deeds, as in the case before us, which is all that we are called upon to decide at present.</p>
