The consideration for the sale is admitted to have been a valuable one, and to have actually passed. The change of tenancy of the house is admitted, and the relation in which the vendor remained in the house, after the sale, is found beyond doubt by the expression of Mr. Chew’s understanding of that relation. After Jeffries had given up the tenancy of the house, Chew might have turned him out of doors without any legal process at any time. He chose to let him remain, and the relation in which he remained was not doubtful or uncertain. He was not tenant at will of the premises, for he had given them up to their owner, and taken down the outward badge of his possession — his name on the doorplate ; but was simply a member for the time being of his father-in-law’s family. At no time after this, had Mr. Jeffries any control, nor did he pretend to have any, either over the premises, the furniture, tlie household arrangements, or the keeping of the house. 1. Upon the question of the validity of the sale from Jeffries to Chew, the bill of sale made by the latter nearly six months afterwards to Mrs. Jeffries, has no bearing, for if the property was his, he had as much right to give it to his daughter as to a stranger. 2. The change of possession was sufficient to take the case out of the statute of 13 Eliz. The reason of the rule in Twyne’s Case, and in Clow <em>v. </em>Woods, 5 S. &amp; R. 288, that the vendor continuing in possession may obtain credit on the faith that he is still the owner of the goods, applies with force to a stock of goods in a store, but not by any means with the same effect to household furniture, timber lying in the woods, or growing crops; and hence, Avhen questions concerning property of the latter classes have arisen, the courts have held that if the change of possession corresponds with the nature of the thing sold, it is sufficient: Chase <em>v. </em>Ralston, 6 Casey 541. The intention of the parties becomes in cases of transfers between persons standing in near relations of business or affinity, an important element in determining whether there has or has not been a sufficient change of possession: Dunlap <em>v. </em>Bournonville, 2 Casey 74; Hugus <em>v. </em>Robinson, 12 Harris 13; 3 State Rep. 224; <a href="/watts/6/0247-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Watts 247" data-case-ids="1846137" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0247-01">6 Watts 247</a>. In Clow <em>v. </em>Woods, and Stark <em>v. </em>Ward, Milne <em>v. </em>Henry, Cadbury <em>v. </em>Nolen, Babb <em>v. </em>Clemson, Hoffner <em>v. </em>Clark, cited by plaintiff in error, there was no change of possession either actual or constructive. In Haynes <em>v. </em>Hunsicker and Chase <em>v. </em>Ralston, a marking of the lumber was held sufficient evidence of a change of possession. In Streeper <em>v. </em>Eckart, Young <em>v. </em>McClure, the badge of fraud consisted in the possession, <a id="p411" href="#p411" data-label="411" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*411</a>if delivered at all, not continuing in the vendee, but reinstated by his act in the vendor. Kepner <em>v. </em>Burkhardt was an action of ejectment, and turned upon the validity of a sale of land, in which of course the element of change of possession had no place. In our case there was a change of possession as clearly marked 'as by the changing of the signs in McVicar <em>v. </em>May and Dunlap <em>v. </em>Bournonville, and much more clearly marked than in Hugus <em>v. </em>Robinson, where the signs were not changed, and in Graham <em>v. </em>McCreary, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20515" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="4 Wright 515">4 Wright 515</a>, where the vendor absented himself for a few weeks and then returned, and had thereafter the same use of the property as before. The possession of vendee here was exclusive in every fair sense of the word. He allowed vendor to sit in the chairs, to eat off the tables, to lie on the beds, as matter of grace but not of right. The change of possession may even be said to have been notorious (although that is not necessary), for immediately on the sale, vendee took down vendor’s sign, the door-plate with his name on it, an act much more likely to give Steelwagon notice of change of possession than the most formal delivery inside of the house, in the presence of a servant, relative, or stranger.</p>

No actual delivery ever took place. True, the door-plate of the house, having on it Jeffries’ name, was taken down, and it is claimed that this was evidence from which a delivery of the contents of the house might be inferred, because the tenancy might be inferred as having been given up. Granted that the termination of the tenancy might be inferred from this circumstance, the household furniture could hardly be supposed to pa.ss to the landlord. The term passed by the surrender: surely nothing could be presumed to have passed excepting such as ought to pass in the same way. But the furniture was not leased, and the surrender of the tenancy therefore could not include it.</p>

All the parties to the transaction lived together after, as they did before, the sale.

It was perhaps inconvenient to do so, and hence they took the risk of the law, as to the necessity of an actual delivery and exclusive possession by the vendee, and I fear they must abide the loss in so doing.</p>
    <p id="b412-7" data-blocks='[["BL_412.5",412,[286,781,1164,1627]],["BL_413.1",413,[240,389,1162,86]]]'>Why is not the transfer of household property to be actual and exclusive, like that of any other personal property ? It is as capable of manual occupancy and removal as almost any other kind. If the sale be actual, it usually is removed; if it be only for the purpose of securing it against creditors, why shall it not stand on the same platform with other property, capable of delivery and change of possession ? In the case of Chase <em>v. </em>Ralston, 6 Casey 541, marking saw-logs in the woods with the name of the vendee, was held sufficient evidence of delivery, because they were not strictly capable of manual delivery. Of the same nature was the property in Haynes <em>v. </em>Hunsicker, 2 Casey 58. It was lumber- at a mill. The transfer of possession in these cases was all that could reasonably accompany the sale, on account of the nature of the property. In Chase <em>v. </em>Ralston, most of the cases in this state were noticed, and the rule to be deduced from them seems almost without the semblance of exception to be, that on a private sale of personal chattels, “if possible the delivery must be actual; but if the nature and bulk of the article preclude this, then it must be constructive, a better term, I think, than symbolical, borrowed from the ancient ceremony of feudal investiture.” Dunlap <em>v. </em>Bournonville, 2 Casey 72, stands on the very outer verge of settled principles; but on its facts still I think is within them. There was a sale to a brother, who, although he had been about the coachmalter-shop, and did the financiering, “after the transfer he took possession, changed the sign to his own name, procured a new book-keeper, and opened a new set of books.” Now, although the brother’s vendors were employed in the shop after the sale as foremen, by the week, yet this was held not to be a circumstance to control the visible and actual marks of ownership presented by the change of the sign, of clerk, and the actual active management of the vendee. This was an immeasurably stronger <em>indicia </em>of ownership than anything in the case in hand. If there be any remark in that case going farther than this, it was by way of illustration, doubtless; for it certainly cannot be fairly understood to mean that an actual change of possession, when it can take place, or something equivalent, shall not be shown to make the transfer of chattels good as against creditors of the vendor. The recent <a id="p413" href="#p413" data-label="413" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*413</a>cases of Milne <em>v. </em>Henry, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Wright%20357" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 Wright 357">4 Wright 357</a>, and Graham <em>v. </em>McCreary, Id. 515, have their foundations solely in this doctrine.</p>
    <p id="b413-7" data-blocks='[["BL_413.4",413,[238,476,1164,463]]]'>We cannot infer, from the evidence in this case, an actual delivery and exclusive possession in the vendee of the property in question. It was capable of such change, and as against creditors did not pass without it. However honest in conscience the transaction may have been between the parties, it was against the policy of the law, and a legal fraud against creditors, of whom the vendor had so many at the time of making the bill of sale as to be in “failing circumstances.” We think, therefore, the court erred in entering judgment for the plaintiff in the interpleader, and that it should have been for the defendant.</p>
