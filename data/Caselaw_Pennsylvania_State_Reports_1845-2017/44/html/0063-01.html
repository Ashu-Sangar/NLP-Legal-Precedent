The learned judge in the court below held that the subscription was made, and the bonds, with coupons attached, were issued in strict conformity to law, and the reasons he has assigned in his charge, and the numerous decisions of this court, clearly show that he was right in coming to this conclusion. Contenting ourselves, therefore, with the reasoning of the court below, we assume that the bonds and coupons were legally binding on the county of Beaver, and this brings us to the fourth' specification of error, which was the real point argued before us.</p>

The bonds were dated 15th September 1853, and the principal and interest were payable at the office of the Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company, in the city of New York. The coupons were numbered from eight to fourteen, inclusive, for the payment of $30 interest from the 15th of September 1857 to the 15th of September 1860, inclusive. The bonds stipulated that the interest was payable upon the delivery of the coupons severally at the said office in New York. It appeared that these coupons were left unpaid, and that no provision was made for the payment in New York or elsewhere, and that the county disputed the legal obligation of the bonds and coupons, and declined <a id="p65" href="#p65" data-label="65" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*65</a>payment. Having therefore decided that the plaintiff could recover on the coupons, the next question was whether he was entitled to interest on them. This question the court decided in the affirmative, at the same time making a very learned argument to show that they were wrong. This forms the subject of the fourth specification of error, and this brings us to the consideration of whether such coupons are recoverable without interest no matter what may be the delays interposed by the corporation or individuals issuing such bonds and coupons, which pass from hand to hand by delivery merely.</p>
    <p id="b65-6" data-blocks='[["BL_65.4",65,[175,809,1173,948]]]'>Before proceeding to the determination of this question it will be proper to state clearly in what light these coupons, settled in this case to be legally issued, and to be held by a person against whom there is neither legal nor equitable defence to the recovery of the amount on their face, are to be considered. In Gorgier <em>v. </em>Mieville, 3 B. &amp; C. 45, Ld. Chief Justice Abbott, in 1824, in speaking of bonds issued by the king of Prussia, said: “ This instrument, in its form, is an acknowledgment by the king of Prussia that the sum mentioned in the bond is due to every .person who shall, for the time being, be the holder of it. And the principal and interest is payable in a certain mode, and at certain periods, mentioned in the bond. It is therefore in its nature precisely analogous to a bank note payable to bearer, or to a bill of exchange endorsed in blank. Being an instrument, therefore, of the same description, it must be subject to the same rule of law that whoever is the holder of it has power to give title to any person honestly acquiring it. It is distinguishable from the case of Glyn <em>v. </em>Baker, because there it did not appear that India bonds were negotiable, and no other person could have sued on them but the obligee. Here, on the contrary, the bond is payable <em>to the hearer, </em>and it was proved at the trial that bonds of this description were negotiated like exchequer bills.”</p>
    <p id="b65-7" data-blocks='[["BL_65.5",65,[172,1757,1172,639]],["BL_66.1",66,[306,376,1175,989]]]'>This case was preceded four years before, by Wookey <em>v </em>Pole, 4 B. &amp; Ald. 1, where it was held that exchequer bills were negotiable, and were of the same nature as notes and bills of exchange. The opinions of the judges examine all the early cases, and are very instructive as to the principles upon which instruments for the payment of money assume the character and qualities of negotiable paper. Lord Chief Justice Abbott, speaking of the exchequer bill which was the subject of the suit, says: <em>“ </em>But, abstracted from authority, I think this instrument is of the same nature as notes and bills of exchange. Like them it is neither valuable nor useful in itself, as goods and chattels, such as a horse, a book, a picture or a pipe of wine are; it is valuable only as entitling the holder to receive at some future time, a certain sum of money, which is a value precisely of the same nature as the value of a note or bill. Notes and bills have <a id="p66" href="#p66" data-label="66" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*66</a>been distinguished from goods in regard to their transfer, for the convenience of trade and commerce; and in regard to their being mercantile and commercial instruments and by law negotiable. It may be true that exchequer bills are not so frequently negotiated, in fact, as some other bills or notes; but I think we are to regard the negotiability of the instrument, and not the frequency of actual negotiation. Exchequer bills are not made for very small sums, and on that account alone they would not become the subject of frequent actual negotiation. A bank note for 5000Í. passes through very few hands; a bank note for <em>51. </em>usually passes through a great number. Many country bank notes have no ordinary circulation beyond a very narrow district. Bills of exchange usually pass through very few hands, but the character of these instruments is in no degree affected by these circumstances. In the case of Grant <em>v. </em>Vaughan, 3 Burr. 1526, which arose upon a draft on a banker, payable to the ship Fortune or bearer, the court held it ought not to have been left to the jury to say whether such drafts were, in fact and practice, <em>negotiable; </em>for that the question whether a bill or note be negotiable or not, is a question of law. And upon such a question of law regarding an exchequer bill, I should, looking at the form of the instrument, and observing that the money is to be payable to the bearer, answer that it is, by law, negotiable.</p>
    <p id="b66-6" data-blocks='[["BL_66.4",66,[305,1364,1169,214]]]'>“ For these reasons, I am of opinion that exchequer bills are negotiable, and may be transferred in the same manner as bills of exchange, and that in those bills, as in bills of exchange, the property passes with the possession, by every mode of transfer, fraud and collusion apart.”</p>
    <p id="b66-7" data-blocks='[["BL_66.5",66,[306,1578,1168,474]]]'>Best, Justice, said: “ The question which the court is called on to decide is whether exchequer bills are to be considered as goods or as the representatives of money, and as such, subject to the same rules, as to the transfer of property in them, as are applicable to money. The delivery of goods by a person who is not the owner (except in the manner authorized by the owner), does not transfer the right to such <em>goods; </em>but it has long been settled that the right to money is inseparable from the possession of it. I conceive that the representative of money, which is made transferrable by delivery only, must be subject to the same rules as the money which it represents. ”-</p>

Mr. Webster, in his argument before the chancellor, p. 531, says: “ The bonds are instruments transferrable by delivery, and the state is bound in honour to pay them to a <em>bond fide </em>holder. A subsequent purchaser in good faith would not be required to know that their original transfer had been unauthorized or illegal.” And the chancellor said, p. 533: “ If these securities, therefore, pass into the hands of <em>bond fide </em>holders who have no notice of any irregularity, or want of authority on the part of the officers or agents of the state, who put them in circulation, the complainant is both legally and equitably bound to pay them, to such holders.” Mr. Justice Bronson, delivering the opinion of the Court of Errors, says, p. 177: “ The bonds are negotiable instruments, the title to which will pass by mere delivery; and although void in the hands of the appellant, they will be valid securities in the hands of a <em>bond fide </em>holder.”</p>

Nor are they like corporation bonds, which are 'issued in negotiable form for sale, and as a means for raising money for corporate uses; the distinction between all these and corporate stocks is marked and striking.

But the Lord Chancellor (Eldon) was of opinion “ that as Backhouse might at the end of every year have brought an action, and have had judgment for the principal and interest then due on the bond, in equity the bonds could not be affected with usury, as the same might be considered as having been called in, and the instalments paid.” And he also thought “ that the defendant ought to pay the principal and interest due into court.” The same result was arrived at where promissory notes were given for each instalment, including interest, in Beete <em>v. </em>Bidgood, 7 Barn. &amp; Cress. 453, although Lord Tenterden gave a more restricted reason for his decision.</p>

In Pennsylvania, where a judgment is revived by <em>scire facias, </em>the amount of principal and interest then due constitutes a new principal, and the plaintiff has a right to charge interest on the aggregate amount of principal and interest due at the time of rendering judgment on each <em>scire facias. </em>In Obermeyer <em>v. </em>Nichols, <a href="/binn/6/0159-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="6 Binn. 159" data-case-ids="1795114" data-case-paths="/binn/6/0159-01">6 Binn. 159</a>, it was held that rent carries interest from the time it is due; and in Buck <em>v. </em>Fisher, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Whart.%20518" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="4 Whart. 518">4 Whart. 518</a>, it was conceded that interest was payable on ground-rent for the several times at which it fell due; and I know that this •course is universally followed in Philadelphia in actions for arrears of ground-rent, and has nevér been disputed. The same doctrine was enunciated three years before by Judge Baldwin, in the case of Newman <em>v. </em>Keffer, in which I was engaged as counsel for the unsuccessful party. In his charge to the jury, Judge Baldwin said, 9 Casey 449: “In Obermeyer <em>v. </em>Nichols, the.

As to ground-rent, they recognised the principle that when there was a clause of re-entry, interest ought to be paid, because equity would relieve only on payment of the rent and interest, and consider them as on the same ground as other rents.

On a recognisance in the Orphans’ Court for securing to a widow the interest on her third part of the money at which an estate is valued, the Act of 1794 makes it recoverable as rent — the Supreme Court hold the widow’s interest to be in the character of annuity, of interest on money, and a rent-charge, and that if the interest be not punctually paid, the widow shall recover interest from the time it became due: <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20203" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="2 Watts 203">2 Watts 203</a>. There cannot be a stronger case; for as a widow’s annuity partakes of the character of a rent-charge, a rent-charge partakes of the character of the annuity, and it is so considered by the court, who put it on the same footing as to bearing interest. The reason is the same in both cases; the annuity is in the nature of maintenance income, and bears interest if not paid punctually, because it is in lieu of the widow’s share of the profits of the land, and all that is reserved to the widow; the rule is the same as to ground-rent, a.s it is of the same nature. But a court never inquires into the fact whether the annuity or the rent is necessary for the support of the widow or the ground-landlord ; the rule is the same whether they are rich or poor, being founded in the nature of the debt, and the manifest justice of the interest being paid as a compensation for withholding payment: <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20203" class="citation" data-index="26" data-cite="2 Watts 203">2 Watts 203</a>.” See Smyser <em>v. </em>Smyser, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 438" data-case-ids="1854644" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0438-01">3 W. &amp; S. 438</a>.

These coupons, which are perhaps copied from coupons or interest warrants attached to English railway debentures (4 Rail, and Canal Cases 709), are negotiable instruments, which may be sued on separately by the holder without the bonds, as soon as they become due, and from their form there can be no reason why interest should not be recovered upon them in the same manner as upon arrears of ground-rent or of annuity. The principal cannot be sued for until 1883, and to recover this the suit would be upon the bond. To secure the payment of the interest punctually, coupons are attached, having the same effect as promissory notes; and if so, can there be any defence to the payment of interest on them, as a compensation for the default of the debtor ? Bonds like these have been declared by the legislature proper investments by trustees and executors, and could it be supposed that the payment of the interest could be indefinitely delayed without any pecuniary punishment ?
