The lot is part of a tract of land which was granted by the Commonwealth to Martin Kercher, by patent dated the 23d of December 1772. On the 23d of January 1779, the patentee conveyed the whole tract to Martin Kercher, Jr., who, on the 1st of December in the same year, conveyed six lots, including No. 110, to Michael Lindemuth, reserving annual ground-rent upon each of five of the lots of 22s. <em>6d. </em>Of the five lots, No. 110 was one. A judgment was obtained against Martin Kercher, Jr., on the 9th of May 1786. An execution was issued in the judgment, and levied on the yearly ground-rents on one hundred and thirty-one lots in Hamburg, into which the tract patented to Martin Kercher, Sr., has been divided. The ground-rents were subsequently sold by the sheriff, who conveyed them, by deed dated the 11th of December 1786, to Charles Shoemaker. On the 16th of May 1791, Shoemaker, by an assignment endorsed on the sheriff’s deed, transferred ‘the within deed-poll, and all the ground-rents thereby due from the 27th day of May [then] last past, to Daniel Ludwig. On the 12th of December 1811, Lud<a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>wig, using precisely similar phraseology, assigned the deed and the ground-rents to Christopher Leis. The subsequent title in the present plaintiff from Christopher Leis is admitted to bo regular.</p>

He sold to Leis the sheriff’s deed-poll, and all the ground-rents thereby due. And as the annual ground-rent on lot No. 110, embraced in the sheriff’s deed, was 22s. <em>6d., </em>the argument is that his assignment did not vest in Leis another ground-rent of 7s. <em>6d. </em>But Ludwig, when he sold to Leis, had an estate in the lot. It was different from the estate which he had purchased; yet it was one which had groivn out of that. He had entered in pursuance of the power reserved in the deed from Kercher to Lindemuth. If he had sold before the entry, he would have clothed his grantee with power to do what he had done himself. But he executed the powrer before he made the transfer. If, after the re-entry, instead of selling the property anew' to Everhart, he had retained it, why would not his assignment of the sheriff’s deed have been effective to vest it in Leis ? It is true that proof of an act <em>in pais </em>would be necessary in establishing the title. But the right to perform that act rested exclusively upon the sheriff’s deed. And if this be so, it is certain that the netv ground-rent of 7s. 6ci. must be treated as equally derived from the same source. It was the acquisition of no new estate in the landi It w'as the result of no independent conveyance. It was a right which rested for its validity upon the assignment by Shoemaker to him in 1791. This assignment was the very original foundation of his interest. And w'hen in his turn he assigned to Leis, he passed <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>over the only muniment of title lie ever held.

One enters upon land under a defective conveyance, which gives him only colour of right. He acquires a title under the Statute of Limitations, and subsequently transfers his original defective conveyance by assignment. Why would not the land pass to his assignee? It can be supposed that instead of creating the ground-rent of 7s. <em>6d. </em>through the form of a re-entry and a new deed, the original rent of 22s. <em>6d. </em>had been reduced by a recorded agreement between Ludwig and Lindemuth, or some grantee of the latter. In that case it would seem obvious justice that an assignment of the sheriff’s deed would have passed the title to the reduced rent. There is an apparent distinction in essential respects between the case presented and the case supposed. And if such a transfer as that from Shoemaker to Leis would have passed title to land, it has been adequate, under the 8th section of the Act of the 25th of April 1850, to sustain the title of the present plaintiffs to this ground-rent. If the representatives of Ludwig were here seeking to recover the arrears now claimed, they would have to be held barred by the assignment. The plaintiffs are entitled to a judgment.</p>
