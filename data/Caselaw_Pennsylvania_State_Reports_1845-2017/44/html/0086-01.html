Some two or three weeks afterward the defendant being informed that a letter was in that office for him, called there and received it. This is the only letter he ever received at that office. He resided in Lower St. Clair township, between two and three miles from Temperanceville, but was engaged in the coal business, and had a platform in that village a short distance from the post-office. There was, at the time in question, a post-office called Mount Lebanon, about a mile and a quarter from his residence, but defendant never either received or mailed any letters at that office. Eor many years üe had mailed and received all his letters, except the one before referred to, at the office in Pittsburgh. His usual route, to the city from his residence was along the Washington <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>turnpike, which lies alongside of the village of Temperaneeville, and he frequently went along the Plank Road, through the village and past the post-office. His neighbours received their letters at the Temperaneeville post-office. The plaintiff, Mr. Woods, was a well-known banker residing in Pittsburgh city, and was the holder of this note at the time of its maturity. The maker and the other endorsers lived in Allegheny City.</p>

If the endorser resides beyond the limits of the city or place where the note is protested for non-payment, the notice may be sent by mail to the post-office nearest to his residence, and this will be sufficient, whether he receives it or not. In the present case, the notice was not sent to Mount Lebanon, the nearest post-office, but to Temperaneeville, which was two miles farther off. The evidence showed that the defendant, Neeld, neither received nor mailed letters at the Mount Lebanon or Temperaneeville post-office, but that all his business was transacted at the Pittsburgh post-office, although he had a coal platform pt Temperaneeville, and a landing.</p>
    <p id="b87-11" data-blocks='[["BL_87.13",87,[212,1640,1171,474]]]'>Under these circumstances the notice might have been legally directed to the Pittsburgh office, but it does not appear that the notary had any knowledge of this practice on the part of Neeld, and he therefore was bound to direct it to the nearest post-office, Mount Lebanon. That the direction to Temperaneeville was erroneous is shown by the fact that the endorser never received the notice for two weeks, and then only because he was told that there was a letter in that office for him. This was the only letter ever received by him from the Temperaneeville post-office. The court below were therefore clearly right, as appears by the opinion of the learned presiding judge.</p>
