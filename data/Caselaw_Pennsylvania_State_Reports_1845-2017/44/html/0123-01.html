The testimony showed the following facts: The date of the levy did not appear by any endorsement on the writ, but the property was advertised before the 17th of July. It was proved by James McGill, who was called as a witness for Childs &amp; Co., and examined under exception, that Dilworth &amp; Bidwell had stated, between July 8th and 17th, that they had stopped the sheriff from making a levy twice, and it was proved by Mr. <em>Barton, </em>counsel for Childs &amp; Co., who was called by McGill &amp; Son, that he was watching the action of Dilworth &amp; Bidwell on their writ; that he went to the sheriff’s office, and ascertaining that there had been no levy on the first writ, had given the sheriff positive directions to levy under his writ.

This information about the existence of personal property was derived from Mr. <em>Barton, </em>counsel for Childs &amp; Co.

After the personal property had been levied upon, Mr. Dilworth repeatedly requested the sheriff not to sell it until after the real estate had been sold, which was refused. The advertising of the personal property was delayed by the sheriff one day, at the request of Mr. Dilworth, who wished to consult his counsel as to the effect the sale might have. No instructions were given to the sheriff about the levy, or to the deputy, by whom it was made, except what he received from the sheriff.</p>

The sheriff then obtained a rule upon the parties to interplead. This rule was entered and docketed only in the case of H. Childs &amp; Co., and was heard and argued by the attorneys of II. Childs &amp; Co. and John McGill &amp; Son, on the one side, and John II. Hampton for the Pennsylvania Railroad Company. Dilworth &amp; Bidwell did not appear to the rule, or take any part in it. On the hearing of this rule, and upon the inspection of a written contract between the Railroad Company and Porter, Rolfe &amp; Swett, the court decided that the right of property in the car-wheels was in the defendants, and refused to direct an issue, but ordered the sheriff to proceed and sell them; which was done, and the proceeds, $2269.50, paid into court, and on the 11th of April 1859, Thomas McConnel, Esq., was appointed auditor to distribute the same.

Upon this judgment a <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued, and placed in the hands of the sheriff, on the 29th of June 1858, by Mr. <em>Shinn, </em>the plaintiffs’ attorney. With this writ was a description of real estate, and Mr. <em>Shinn </em>stated at the time that there was personal property at the works of the defendants in South Pittsburgh, and that he wanted the personal property exhausted, and as there would not be enough to cover the debt, he put in a levy on the real estate. In the bond there was a waiver of inquisition. Now as the execution bound all the defendants’ personal property in the bailiwick, from the time it was put into the sheriff’s hands, and whether a levy had been made or not, it is clear that if the instructions given had been followed out, no difficulty could have occurred from any other execution having been issued afterwards. Owing, however, to some want of attention in the sheriff’s office, the advertising clerk not knowing that there was <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>personal property, or of the instructions given by the plaintiffs’ attorney, advertised the real estate for sale, but one or two days afterwards he learned there was personal property, and he caused it to be levied upon and sold. Other personal property, consisting of car-wheels, was levied upon and claimed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, which claim not being sustained, the same were subsequently sold on the 11th October 1858. The former sale of personal property was on the 24th July 1858, and of the real estate on the 30th of the same month.</p>

Childs &amp; Co. obtained a judgment against Porter, Rolfe &amp; Swett for $450, and on the next day issued <em>a, ft. fa. </em>and placed it in the hands of the sheriff. The levy under this execution was of course subject to the prior lien of the first execution. In a list of personal property furnished the sheriff by Dilworth &amp; Bidwell, it is said the car-wheels were not included, but this is immaterial, as it was the sheriff’s duty to levy upon all the personal estate, no matter by whom the information of its existence was given.</p>

The only delay in advertising it was for one single day, which did no harm to any one. In all this we can see nothing which should postpone the first execution to the second one.</p>
