That it did not decide that a former suit, pending and undetermined, was a <em>good </em>plea in abatement, is shown by Lowry <em>v. </em>Hall, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20133" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 133">2 W. &amp; S. 133</a>; Irvin <em>v. </em>The Lumbermen’s Bank, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20208" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 208">2 W. &amp; S. 208</a>.

The pendency of a prior suit in a state court is not a good plea in abatement to a suit <em>in personam </em>in this court. At common law the pendency of a suit in a foreign court was not a good plea in abatement. In respect to all proceedings prior to judgment, the courts of the different states must be considered as so far foreign to each other, that a remedy sought by judicial proceedings under one, cannot be treated as a mere and simple repetition of a remedy sought under another.

But it was decided by the Privy Council, 1792, in Bayley <em>v. </em>Edwards, 3 Swanston 703, by Lord Camden and the Master of the Rolls, Sir Richard Pepper Arden, afterwards Lord Alvanley, that a suit pending in England is not a good plea to the jurisdiction to a subsequent suit in Jamaica for the same cause of action. Lord Camden said: “ The plaintiff in England attempts to set up the suit here in bar of the jurisdiction of Jamaica, but the causes for allowing the plea of double suits are all where the suits are in courts here, while this is of a second suit in a court which is a foreign court, inasmuch as this country has no process to enforce its decrees in the islands.” “As to the inconvenience considering the difficulties of administering justice between parties occasionally living under the separate jurisdictions, I think the parties ought to be amenable to every court possible where they are travelling from country to country, and we must then endeavour to correct the mischiefs of these double suits, as much as we can, by allowing in each country the benefit of all the other proceedings in the other part of the king’s dominions.”</p>

S. 65, it was held that proceedings pending between the same parties for the same cause of action, in one of the superior courts of the United States, was no ground for staying proceedings in an action in England. Erie, C. J., said : <em>“ </em>No authority has been cited to support it. Although there may be some hardship in having proceedings pending in two countries at the same time, I think we are bound so to enforce the -laws as to enable the plaintiff to obtain satisfaction of his debt. There would be great danger in interfering to prevent a man from being sued in this country, when he may have left his own for the very purpose of avoiding the consequences of a suit against him there.” Williams, J., said: “The question is whether the fact of the plaintiff" having another action pending against the defendant in a foreign court is a bar of his remedy in the courts of this country. I am not aware of any principle upon which such an argument could rest, and in the absence of any authority we cannot interfere.”</p>

In this case the court held that an action for an assault and battery committed at Naples could be sustained in England, notwithstanding the pendency of civil proceedings for the same wrong in a Neapolitan court. The court said (31 L. J. Éxch. 461): “ Then it comes to this: that this is a wrong for which an action would lie here, and for which (as it is not negatived) we must assume an action will lie at Naples, but in respect of which, proceedings are pending at Naples at the plaintiff’s instance. This, however, is no defence. It cannot be a defence in bar of the action. It would be no answer, even in abatement of the writ, that an action was pending here in an inferior court, and how in law or reason can it be an answer that it is pending in a foreign court, when the action is in no sense local ? The case of Cox <em>v. </em>Mitchell is an authority to show that an action pending abroad for a wrong, is no ground for staying proceedings in an action here.”</p>

The same doctrine in effect was enunciated by Judge Washington, in Buckner <em>v. </em>Finley, <a href="/us/27/0586-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Pet. 586" data-case-ids="11339357" data-case-paths="/us/27/0586-01">2 Pet. 586</a>.

In all other respects, the states are necessarily’foreign to and independent of each other.” They are each governed by their own laws, and, their courts having no extraterritorial power to enforce their decrees beyond their jurisdictional limits, they are in that sense foreign to each other, which is the clear and settled doctrine of the common law.</p>

In McJilton <em>v. </em>Love, 13 Illinois 494, and Goodall <em>v. </em>Marshall, 11 New Hamp. 99, the same doctrine is asserted. In White <em>v. </em>Whitman, 1 Curtis 494, Judge Curtis says, after speaking of the New York •cases in 9 and 12 Johnson, “these cases seem to me to have been correctly decided. Though the Constitution and laws of the United States require that the judgments rendered in one state <a id="p331" href="#p331" data-label="331" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*331</a>shall receive full faith and credit in another, yet in respect to all proceedings prior to judgment, the courts of the different states acting under different sovereignties, must be considered as so far foreign to each other that a remedy sought by judicial proceedings under one, cannot be treated as a mere and simple repetition of a remedy sought under another. There may be real advantages to be gained in respect of the property on which an execution may be levied, or otherwise by resorting to an action in another state, and the same considerations are applicable to a second suit in a Circuit Court of the United States while one is pending in a state court,” and the same opinion is expressed by the same judge in Lyman <em>v. </em>Brown, 2 Curtis 559.</p>
