It would be the case of a special partner claiming as creditor of an insolvent firm of which he was a member. The answer to this is just what the learned judge gave, namely, the twelfth section of the “Limited Partnership Act.” “In case of the insolvency or bankruptcy of the partnership, no special partner shall, under any circumstances, be allowed to claim as a creditor until the <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>claims of all the other creditors of the partnership shall be satisfied.” These are the words of the statute.</p>

But in Mills <em>v. </em>Argall, <a href="/paige-ch/6/0577-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Paige Ch. 577" data-case-ids="2181735" data-case-paths="/paige-ch/6/0577-01">6 Paige 577</a>, the chancellor, Walworth, held that he could not so claim.

But there is an implication on the point arising from the legislation of that state; for the provision in question in the original act was amended in 1857 (3 Rev.
