But whether the action be for money paid, or specially for not indemnifying the plaintiff, still it is only a chose in action, which is assignable in equity, and therefore the suit must be in the name of the assignor for the use of the assignee. But as the assignee is the real owner, it would seem but just, if the debtor chooses expressly to promise to the assignee to pay the debt to him, that the assignee might sustain an action against him in his own name, and this was the view taken in the early English cases of Fenner <em>v. </em>Meares, 2 W. Bl. Rep. 1269; Israel <em>v. </em>Douglas, 1 H. Bl. Rep. 239. It would seem, however, that in England the rule at present is to require the consideration of forbearance, or some <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>other new consideration, to enable the assignee to proceed in his own name: 1 Chit.

    <p id="b360-6" data-blocks='[["BL_360.4",360,[291,481,1163,683]]]'>In America, however, the early English doctrine has been adopted, and this is clearly the sound rule, for it is a promise to pay to the real owner of the debt, requiring no other consideration than the fact that the debtor is morally and equitably bound to pay it to his actual creditor, and is not allowed to discharge himself by paying it to any other person. This was the decision in Massachusetts as early as 1813, in Crocker <em>v. </em>Whitney, <a href="/mass/10/0316-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Mass. 316" data-case-ids="2027032" data-case-paths="/mass/10/0316-01">10 Mass. 316</a>, and reaffirmed in Mowry <em>v. </em>Todd, 12 Id. 281.
