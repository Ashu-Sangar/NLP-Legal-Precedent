To have and to hold the said messuage, &amp;e., unto my said grandson, Philip DeTurk, during his natural life, and after his decease, to the heirs of his body lawfully begotten, and their heirs and assigns respectively for ever, in such manner and shares as the said Philip DeTurk may see fit to divide it among them, which he shall have full power to do as he pleases.’ Philip DeTurk took possession of the property under the will, married in the year 1806, and died on the 5th of March 1861. His legal representatives, at the time of his death, were his oldest son, Daniel DeTurk, the present defendant; the six children of Martin DeTurk, his second son, who died in 1850 ; two surviving children of his daughter Anna Iloch, who died twenty-five years ago, and two surviving children of his daughter Esther Yoder, who died in 1838. On the 17th of May 1843, Philip DeTurk made his will, which was proved on the 28th of March 1861, devising to the (then living) four children of his daughter Esther Yoder 3 acres and 115 perches of the land devised by Martin Shenkel, which the jury have appraised at $464.84$; devising to the (then living) three children of Anna Hoch 3 acres and 116 perches of the same land, which the jury have appraised at $465.62$; devising to Daniel DeTurk 130 acres and 148 perches of the same <a id="p530" href="#p530" data-label="530" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*530</a>land, which the jury have appraised at $16,370.25 ; and devising to Martin DeTurk and his heirs 190 acres and 141 perches of the same land, which the jury have appraised at $23,859.53|-. The purpart devised to Daniel DeTurk, containing 130 acres and 148 perches, is that which is now in controversy. The plaintiffs are one of the daughters of Mrs. Yoder and her husband. The appointment by Philip DeTurk is repudiated, and this ejectment is brought to recover the one undivided eighth part of this property, to which it is claimed Mrs. Graeff is entitled as one of the heirs of her grandfather, under the will of - his grandfather, Martin Shenkel. The general grounds upon which this cause is rested by the counsel for the plaintiffs are, that ,the devise to Philip DeTurk was of a life estate in this land; that a remainder in fee was limited to his children, which vested in them upon their birth; that the power granted to him in addition to his estate, was a power to part and divide, and not to create title; and that, for a variety of reasons, this power has not been duly and adequately exercised. If, upon the facts set out in the special verdict, it was necessary to ascertain the exact nature of the legal title of Philip DeTurk, under Martin Shenkel’s will, leaving the question of power out of view, the court would probably be compelled to hold it to be an estate tail. In construing the devise, reliance is placed upon the use of the word ‘ respectively’ superadded to the words ‘heirs of his body.’ It has been held in Pennsylvania, that distributive words following and qualifying apt words for the creation of estates tail, have the effect to reduce such estates to estates for life. Such was the effect of the use of the words ‘ as tenants in common and not as- joint tenants’ in Findley <em>v. </em>Riddle, <a href="/binn/3/0139-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Binn. 139" data-case-ids="1791096" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0139-01">3 Binn. 139</a>, and in Nebinger <em>v. </em>Upp, 13 S. &amp; R. 65. But even where such terms are employed, these authorities are in conflict with the general current of the English cases, which would seem to recognise the doctrine that where there is a limitation in a will to ‘ heirs of the body,’ super-added words importing that they are to take concurrently or distributively, are to be treated as repugnant to the words of limitation, and as such to be rejected: Doe d. Chandler <em>v. </em>Smith, 7 Durn &amp; E. 532; Pierson <em>v. </em>Vickers, 5 East 548; Bennet <em>v. </em>Earl of Tankerville, 19 Ves. 170; Jesson <em>v. </em>Wrights, 2 Bligh 1. With the rule established in Guthrie’s Appeal, <a href="/wright/1/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Wright 9" data-case-ids="626208" data-case-paths="/wright/1/0009-01">1 Wright 9</a>, that estates tail are not within our Intestate Act, and that such estates must descend to the eldest son, courts will not unnecessarily construe any devise as creating such an estate. Still while we are bound by our own authorities to the extent to-which they go, the use of such a qualifying word as ‘ respectively’ added to words that aptly create a tenancy in tail, could not upon recognised principles, in the absence of direct precedent, be held sufficient to reduce the estate to one for life. Even in Guthrie’s Appeal it <a id="p531" href="#p531" data-label="531" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*531</a>was said by the Supreme Court that ‘ it has been ruled that in cases where the remainder has been limited to heirs of the body, a direction that they shall take distributively will not prevent the application of the rule in Shelly’s Case, and this is because the presumption arising from the use of the word “heirs” is too strong to be rebutted by the repugnant provision for distribution.’ It is not necessary in this case even to refer to the doctrine of approximation, or, as it is generally called, the <em>ey pres </em>doctrine, by which the general intent of a testator is said to be attained by a sacrifice of his particular intent. It is enough to say that a settled rule rejects the word relied on for repugnancy, and that no authority is shown to impugn the rule. While the question is probably of no present significance, our opinion is that, apart from the clause conferring a power upon Philip DeTurk, he took, under Martin Shenkel’s will, an estate tail. While the devise was to Philip DeTurk and the heirs of his body, the land was to be divided among those heirs in such manner and shares as he should choose. There is no difficulty in ascertaining the intention of Martin Shenkel in this direction. It is objected that it was not the design to give the devisee authority to do more than make an <em>equal </em>distribution. But he did not say that. Taking the theory of the plaintiffs as sound, that the devise created a life estate, a direction for distribution, if it must be held to have required equal distribution, was simple supererogation, for this would have been effected by the law. We have merely to look to the plain obvious meaning of the language of the testator. No formal set of words is requisite to create or reserve a power. It may be created by deed or will, and it is sufficient that the intention be clearly declared. The creation, execution, and destruction of powers, all depend on the substantial intention of the parties; and they are construed equitably and liberally in furtherance of that intention: 4 Kent 319. While McKonkey’s Appeal, 1 Harris 253, is probably of no value as an authority, as it was overruled in Pennock’s Estate, 8 Harris 268, still the opinion of the court contains the expression of views that are pertinent to the present question. ‘ It is settled,’ said the chief justice, ‘that under a bequest for life, with a power over the residue, all take equal portions immediately under the will in case the power be not executed, and that an execution of it does no more than alter the allotments; but that all must take something, and take it, not from the donee of the power, but from the testator, as a particular bequest of so much to each. If the testator meant to say that Mrs. Pennock should have the personalty, with no other power over the surplus than to divide it equally, he meant to say nothing, for the Statute of Distributions would have said it for him. In a general sense, equality is said to be equity, hut it is not universally so. There <a id="p532" href="#p532" data-label="532" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*532</a>may be cases in which equality would not only be inexpedient but'unjust. A son might forfeit his claim to it by becoming a spendthrift, a gambler, a drunkard, or a felon, while his brother may have been labouring to support the family and improve the. estate.’ There is nothing in the words employed by Martin Shenkel, which expressly or by necessary implication would look to an equal division of this property.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b532-6" data-blocks='[["BL_532.4",532,[277,668,1158,944]]]'>“ It is objected, again, that there has been no due execution of this power. It is said that the will of Philip DeTurk contains no reference to the power. But would this be necessary ? Three classes of cases have been said to be sufficient demonstrations of an intention to execute a power: 1. Where there has been some reference to the <em>poiver </em>in the instrument of execution. 2. Where there has been a reference to the <em>property </em>which was the subject on which it was to be executed. 3. Where the instrument of execution would have no operation whatever, except as an execution of the power: Wetherill <em>v. </em>Wetherill, 6 Harris 265. But how can this question be important to these plaintiffs ? If, under the language of the whole devise to him, he took an estate in fee, his own will passed the land by virtue of his title. If he took an estate tail, and the appointment was void, the land descends to the eldest son as the heir at common law, and that son is the defendant. If he took a life estate, then he had no <em>interest </em>to pass under his will, and to make it operative at all, its operation must be attributed to the power. This point, after all, seems to be the only one which makes the inquiry into the nature of the estate created by the first devisee, a practical one. And in the situation of these parties, it is not seen how the plaintiffs can derive advantage from the result of such an inquiry.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b532-7" data-blocks='[["BL_532.5",532,[280,1606,1155,389]]]'>“It is also objected against the appointment by Philip DeTurk that no authority was given to him to execute the power by will. But in what more appropriate way could it have been executed ? For his own life, at the least, he was to hold the land. He was not required to divide it before his death, and dividing it in contemplation of his death, there is no objection apparent to the mode which he adopted. When the mode in which a power is to be executed is not defined, it may be executed by deed or will, or simply by writing: 4 Kent 330.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b532-8" data-blocks='[["BL_532.6",532,[281,1995,1158,384]],["BL_533.1",533,[199,401,1167,600]]]'>“ The remaining question is founded on the allegation that the division of the estate by Philip DeTurk was illusory, and therefore void. The plaintiffs invoke the aid of the doctrine which long prevailed in the English courts of equity, that where there was a power of appointment among several distributees, it was not sufficient that there should be a legal execution of the power by giving a part to each appointee; but that it should be a real and substantial part, and such as would give the appointee a beneficial interest in the fund, fairly and reasonably proportioned <a id="p533" href="#p533" data-label="533" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*533</a>to the whole amount for distribution. At law, where distribution was made to all the requisite appointees, if there was no control of the discretion of the donee of the power, any plan of division was sustained; but in equity the appointment of a nominal share to one of the beneficiaries was held to be illusory, and the proper court thereupon took upon itself the duty of dividing the fund equally among all the parties entitled to it. This rule of the English chancery is sought to be introduced as the ground for the decision of this cause. It is insisted that the devise by Philip DeTurk to the heirs of Mrs. Yoder was a fraudulent exercise of the power of distribution which Martin Shenkel had conferred upon him; that proportioned to the whole value of the estate, the share set out to these heirs was merely nominal, and that it is the duty of the court to set it aside.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b533-6" data-blocks='[["BL_533.4",533,[195,1003,1168,1070]]]'>“ So far as this court have means of knowledge, this principle has never been applied, formally and authoritatively, in Pennsylvania. And in view of the difficulty and embarrassment which attended its enforcement while it existed in England, there would seem to be slight ground for encouragement of the attempt to naturalize it here. In Vandersee <em>v. </em>Aclom, 4 Ves. 771, the Master of the Rolls said: ‘ There is no question that has caused more doubt or difficulty in the mind of every judge who has sat in this court.’ In Spencer <em>v. </em>Spencer, 5 Ves. 364, he said: !I am not at liberty to depart from that rule which has created difficulty, and given so much uneasiness to every judge since it was first adopted as to illusory appointments. No rule has ever given me so much pain as that; and every judge has felt the difficulties arising from it.’ Kemp <em>v. </em>Kemp, 5 Ves. 849, was argued in May 1795. The Master of the Rolls, in deciding it in March 1801, said: ‘It is vain now to lament, as I have done in many cases, that this court did not follow the rule of law.’ Finally, the statute of Wm. 4, ch. 46, entitled ‘An act to alter and amend the law relating to illusory appointments,’ was passed, declaring that no appointment should be impeached in equity on the ground that it is unsubstantial, illusory, or nominal. With the history before us of the rule in England, it would seem scarcely possible that it could be safely introduced into the jurisprudence of Pennsylvania. At any rate, we do not regard its introduction as the proper function of a Court of Common Pleas.</p>
