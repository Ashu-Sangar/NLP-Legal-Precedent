This contract was ratified and confirmed by the board of directors of the Pittsburgh and Steubenville Railroad Company on the 14th day of August 1856. On the 14th day of July 1857, in the District Court of Allegheny county, McBroom &amp; Wood filed a bill in Equity, in which said contract was fully set forth, and recovered a judgment against the Pittsburgh and Steubenville Railroad Company <em>et al., </em>on the 5th day of January 1858, for $8890.93 (including in said judgment the $5000, assumed on the 12th day of May 1855). The balance was for other work done by McBroom and Wood for the railroad company. On the 27th day of April 1858 they issued an execution attachment, attaching moneys, goods, chattels, &amp;c., in the hands and possession of Thomas Clark and William Thaw, partners, &amp;c., as Clark &amp; Thaw; also in the hands of James S.

Craft, as an indemnity against loss by reason of his endorsement or guaranties made or to be made on account of the company, the unpaid instalments or balances due on subscriptions to the capital stock of the company. This is clearly not an assignment in trust for any one, and is not therefore required to be recorded within thirty days after its execution in the office of the recorder of deeds of the proper county; nor of course is the assignee bound within the same period to file an inventory in the office of the prothonotary of the Court of Common Pleas.

It is unnecessary to decide whether this resolution applies to a case like the present, for it is clear that if it were applicable the appellants do not come within the class of persons who can take advantage of the alleged invalidity, for they were not creditors of the company until more than nine months after the assignment was executed ; nor wore they contractors, labourers, or workmen. The bill in equity sot forth in their paper-books shows that they were not creditors of, nor had any claim on the company until the 14th August 1856, when, as appears by the minutes, with the assent of Manfull, Nicholson &amp; Co., $5000 of the balance due them was appropriated to the payment of McBroom &amp; Wood, for work done under their sub-contract made with the sub-contractor for section 3. The other item of the 19th September 1856 was an order of Manfull’ Nicholson &amp; Co., of that date, for $3228.25, which, if accepted by the company on the same day, only made them creditors from that period. It is unnecessary to examine whether such a mode of becoming creditors of the company would entitle them to dispute any such assignment <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>made by the company at any time, because they were in respect to these claims neither contractors, labourers, or workmen, within the express words of the resolutions.</p>
