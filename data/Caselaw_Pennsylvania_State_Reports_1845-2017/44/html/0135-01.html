Harman and Fulmer were tried along with the plaintiffs in error, but wore acquitted by the jury. Snyder elected to have a separate trial, and his case was continued to February Term 1863. The indictment contained three counts. The first two were for murder, and the third for voluntary manslaughter.</p>

The plaintiffs in error, with other young men in the vicinity, went in the evening to the house of the bride, where the wedding party was assembled, to serenade the bride and groom. In the serenading party there was an old sword, broken off at the point, carried by Philip Walters, who acted as captain, a gun in possession of Joseph Harman, and a pistol in the hands <a id="p136" href="#p136" data-label="136" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*136</a>of some one in the crowd. There was also a fife, a horse-fiddle, and sleigh-bells in the possession of the serenaders, all intended for the purpose of music and noise. The party proceeded very orderly, until they came to the house where the wedding party was, when they entered the yard in front of the house, fired off the gun and pistol, marched backward and forward several times, making music and much noise, which finally ceased.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b136-6" data-blocks='[["BL_136.4",136,[291,686,1157,514]]]'>After the music had ceased, Philip Walters approached the porch of the house, when Thomas McLaughlin, one of the wedding party, asked him what they wanted; Walters replied that they wanted to see the bride and groom. McLaughlin said they were not there. Walters replied that they were. McLaughlin then inquired, What will you do if you don’t see them ? Walters replied, he did not know. McLaughlin then repeated the question, when Walters replied that they would have to, or would, pull down the house. At this time, Thomas Keleher, another of the wedding party, came forward, and, some of the witnesses say, cried out, “If that is what you want, tear away;” others say he used the words, “ Jesus Christ, go to work, boys.”</p>

The witnesses for the Commonwealth testified that Walters struck the first blow with the sword, while the witnesses for defendants swore that, when a rush was made upon him, Walters stepped backward, raised the sword, and held it parallel across his breast, requesting "McLaughlin to keep off. Keleher approached Walters from behind, seized him by the coat collar, and pulled him down. A general melee then occurred around Walters, who was very severely injured, receiving two wounds on his head — one a severe bruise, and the other a cut, some three inches in length, penetrating to the skull-bone.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b137-6" data-blocks='[["BL_137.4",137,[205,664,1167,345]]]'>Which was answered as follows; “We answer, this would be so if defendants did not take part in the serenade; but if they were there, participating and assisting in the serenade, and were within the grounds or yard, drawn up near the porch, and a general fight ensued, without design on their part, and one of the party, though not one of these defendants, struck the deceased, causing death, they would be guilty of manslaughter, as we have explained in our general charge.”</p>

The case of The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Gable <em>et al., </em>7 S. &amp; R. 423, decided in 1821, seems to have settled this question, and the practice has been in accordance therewith, it is believed, ever since. In that case it was held that involuntary manslaughter <em>must </em>be prosecuted and punished as a misdemeanor. The 79th section of the Criminal Code, passed the 31st of March 1860, is a copy of the 8th sect, of the Act of 22d April 1794, upon which that decision was made, and varies from it in nothing but in fixing the maximum of punishment which may be inflicted. I have no knowledge of any departure from the rule there laid down, and, on inquiry, I have been informed by the president of the Oyer and Terminer of this city that the practice under the rule has not been to the extent of his experience, changed by the Act of 1860. Indeed, it could not be without overruling that decision, for the 79th section of the late statute, as we have seen, is but a copy of the 8th section of the statute under which it was made. I therefore think elaboration of the point unnecessary. The decision clearly announces the rule, and sufficiently vindicates it, and no public policy has demanded a change. Indeed, the inducement for compromising a result in the jury-box, where several grades of <a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>offences exist in a single count, as it may in an indictment for murder, is quite as large as it ought to be. By this means the lowest accountability is often made to assume the place of the highest.</p>
    <p id="b139-5" data-blocks='[["BL_139.4",139,[209,571,1165,516]]]'>When the officers of the Commonwealth shall be of opinion that a homicide is but manslaughter, and the degree is doubtful, the statute allows an indictment charging the offence both as voluntary and involuntary, or either. But it is necessary, in order to sustain a conviction'for involuntary manslaughter, that it be distinctly charged as such. Since the case of The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Gable, it must be charged as a misdemeanor, and is therefore not proper to form a count in an indictment for felonious homicide, excepting in the case of an indictment for voluntary manslaughter, where it may be joined by force of the statute. We must therefore reverse the sentence in this case, as there is no legal conviction to sustain it.</p>
    <p id="b139-6" data-blocks='[["BL_139.5",139,[205,1087,1167,857]]]'>We cannot conclude without expressing our regret that the absurd and silly practice exists in some portions of the country of serenading, as it is miscalled, weddings parties, not with music, but usually by making intolerable noises with horns, drums, kettles, pans, and anything which may contribute to .the dissonance of the occasion. This is always offensive, and insulting to the feelings of the parties and their friends, and generally ends in breaches of the peace, and sometimes bloodshed. It is a breach of the peace itself, and when a number of persons, three or more, assemble for such a purpose, and with a common intent carry it out with noise and tumult, it may and ought to be punished as a riot: Ad. Rep. 277. The case before ns is a melancholy instance of the pernicious and indecent practice, and although it may be that originally no harm to any persons was intended, yet it resulted in the death of the bridegroom on the day of his marriage, and in injury to others, besides putting in peril of the highest penal laws of the country the prisoners whose case we have been considering. -This should be a warning to the thoughtless, for none others would ¿engage in it, to abstain from such evil practices.</p>
