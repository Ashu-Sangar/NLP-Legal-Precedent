And the punishment is grossly unjust because grossly unequal, and it can be only by mere accident that it is at all proportionate to the offence. No matter how small the fraud, it forfeits the whole value contracted for, be it ten or ten thousand dollars. And, if nothing can confirm the contract in favour of the defrauder, then the other party may get all he bargained for, and afterwards recover back all he gave; in order to make the punishment as severe as possible, he may, knowing of the fraud, wait until he obtains full performance from his adversary, and then set up the fraud as a ground for rescinding the contract for all he paid under it. This is making a person who is guilty of a fraud practically an outlaw, for all his interests that are involved in the fraudulent contract. The law does not usually deal thus with any offender. It keeps its temper even in dealing with fraud, and especially in the investigation of its existence and degree.</p>

But affirmance here is not by becoming a party to the contract, but by putting oneself or others in such a position that one is no longer allowed to assert the wrong done to him. Nor can there be a rescission of the contract by the party wronged in this class of cases, because rescission can have place only between the parties to the contract' and their privies.</p>

The contract itself must therefore be a nullity as against his rights, though by its performance it may be very far from being a nullity; for if he be not prompt in asserting his rights, it may dispose of all the property so that he can never reach it. It is therefore not absolutely void, but void only in relation to him in so far as he asserts its nullity in time and form to do it effectively.</p>

These are absolutely void, because they have no legal sanction, and establish no legitimate bond or relation between the parties, and even a stranger may raise the objection : 2 Leon. 218; Moore 105.

Of course when two men make a contract in fraud of creditors, neither of them can ratify it, for that would be to forgive their own sins. And so when the contract is in substance or in essential form illegal, neither party can ratify it, because the wrong done is against the state, and it only can forgive it. For this sort of wrong there can be no private ratification. A ratification that leaves the vice unpurged and unforgiven is itself null.</p>

Many have restricted the term <em>void </em>to the former class of contracts which are absolutely void, and adopted the term <em>voidable </em>as the predicate of the latter class which are only relatively void, though it does not exactly express this conception of the infirmity.</p>
    <p id="b15-8" data-blocks='[["BL_15.6",15,[214,1686,1170,345]]]'>The terms void and voidable, as used in our books, would therefore seem to stand for absolutely and relatively void. That is <em>absolutely void, </em>which the law or the nature of things forbids to be enforced at all, and that is <em>relatively void </em>which the law condemns as a wrong to individuals, and refuses to enforce as against them. It is void, because absolutely or relatively invalid, or not binding. The French <em>jurisconsults </em>adopt this distinction of absolute and relative nullity.</p>

A contract may for a time be voidable as against one, and void as against the others, whom it was intended to affect; voidable as against the parties doing wrong, and void as against the persons wronged; or <em>vice versa, </em>voidable in favour of the persons wronged, and void in favour of the wrongdoer; void as not binding to fulfil, and voidable after fulfilment; voidable in fact because void or not <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>binding in right. And when the party wronged elects to avoid the act, it becomes binding on neither or rescinded as to both.

The judgment does not annul the contract, but declares or decides that it <em>is </em>null; that it has an inherent vice that renders it not binding, not obligatory, void. In this sense it is Voidable or avoidable, because void; just as a good contract is available or enforceable, because valid; and therefore void is not an improper term for such vicious contracts.</p>

Many of the cases show that he cannot rescind the contract unless he is able, without inevitable accident, to restore the property received in a condition reasonably approximate to that in which he received it; that is, allowing for the wear and tear that are consistent with reasonable care, and that happen before the discovery of the fraud.</p>

We cannot say that this is wrong. One count for damages for the fraud and one for a rescission <em>would </em>be repugnant: 4 B. &amp; P. 851.</p>

But part of the consideration paid in this case was land and claims against other persons, and these cannot be recovered under a count for money had and received unless and only so far as the defendant has converted them into money. If he wants more than mere rescission, he must sue for damages for the deceit. Rescission is the act of rejecting a contract and all its consequences, and its nature is not changed by the intensity of the. causes that justify it, any more than the nature of a sale Í3 changed by the magnitude of its consideration.

Ratification is in general the adoption of a previously formed contract, notwithstanding a vice that rendered it relatively void; and by the very nature of the act of ratification, confirmation, or affirmance (all these terms are in use to express the same thing), the party confirming becomes a party to the contract, he that was not bound becomes bound by it, and entitled to all the proper benefits of it, he accepts the consideration of the contract as a sufficient consideration for adopting it, and usually this is quite enough to support the ratification. A mere ratification cannot of course correct any defect in the terms of the contract. If it is in its very terms invalid for want of consideration, or for any other defect, a mere ratification can add nothing to its binding force.</p>
