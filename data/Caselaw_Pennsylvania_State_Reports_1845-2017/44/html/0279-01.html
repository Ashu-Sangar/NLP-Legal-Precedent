The appellant’s husband is now dead, and she is left without issue. Whatever reasonable object the two deeds were designed to accomplish is at an end. In each case the property was her own. In the one case, it had before been impressed only with a trust for her separate use, which of course dropped with her husband’s death. In the other case, it had been hers in absolute right. The machinery devised for her protection being, as matters stand, not a protection, but an obstruction, she asks to have it removed, and to have what was and is really her own property placed at her own disposal. The only obstacle in the way of this is occasioned by the contingent personages who in the one deed are described as those who would “ have been her legal representatives, had she died a widow, under and by virtue of the intestate laws of Pennsylvania;” and who, in the other deed, are called, in more assured phrase, “her heirs and legal representatives.” If these remote and undetermined beneficiaries possess an equal right, in their degree and in their due time, with the appellant; if, in other words, they are “purchasers” of the trust funds, not by their own hand, which would be impossible, but by the deliberate bounty of another, even of the appellant herself, then the obstacle is insurriiountable. But if this is not so ; if these “legal representatives,” hypothetical or absolute, can be shown to have no independent legal existence, or to be in no rational sense the objects of a deliberate and irrevocable gift, then the obstacle is overcome. The words “representatives,’.’ “personal representatives,” “legal representatives,” “legal personal representatives,” belong to that class of vague phrases which are employed, after the real meaning has exhausted itself in precise language, to round a sentence or to end a trust, and have therefore called forth a good many decisions. They never correspond to or represent, in a testator’s mind for instance, the conception of any specific person or class of persons; of any, in short, whom or which he would be at the trouble of defining. They are the mere guess-work of draughtsmen, thrown in to supply the want of positive instructions, and <a id="p283" href="#p283" data-label="283" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*283</a>to provide in a general way for future events, for which the testator has cared too little to busy himself. Still they, as well as other phrases, have to be construed by courts, and as these are often more puzzled by the absence of meaning than by its bad expression, the decisions are not only numerous, but somewhat conflicting, at least in appearance. This much is clear, that where the words “legal representatives” are used as the mere continuation of a previous limitation, not as a substitution for it; when the object seems merely to indicate generally who is next to take, not to designate a new and distinct class of beneficiaries ; when there is no context to qualify the words, or to suggest a special intention, then these words “ legal representatives,” as to personal property, mean simply executors or administrators who represent a decedent in the eye of the law, and continue his legal existence, just as his heirs do, in other respects: Duncan <em>v. </em>Walker, <a href="/yeates/1/0213-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Yeates 213" data-case-ids="6773375" data-case-paths="/yeates/1/0213-01">1 Yeates 213</a>; <a href="/us/2/0205-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Dall. 205" data-case-ids="11741664,11742121" data-case-paths="/us/2/0205-01,/us/2/0205-02">2 Dall. 205</a>; Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Bryan, 6 S. &amp; R. 83; Price <em>v. </em>Strange, 6 Madd.

Had the words been “executors and administrators,” the court would have compelled an assignment by the trustees, Holloway <em>v. </em>Clarkson, 2 Hare 523, which is exactly the present case, except in that respect, and in this, that there was no trust as here to convey or assign to the executors ; that this last is not to be considered as making any difference in this state, as settled by Kuhn <em>v. </em>Newman, 2 Casey 227; Kay <em>v. </em>Scates, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Wright%2031" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Wright 31">1 Wright 31</a>. It must be admitted that the words “legal representatives” in the first deed cannot possibly mean executors or administrators. They, particularly the executors, would not take under or by virtue of any intestate -law. And if we regard the intention, rather- than the words, the purpose was to exclude the husband; and as he would take by operation of law, they who are substituted for him must necessarily take by purchase. Of course no subsequent events can alter the construction of a deed. Yet it is absurd that Mrs. Ralston, whose own this fund was — subject to the technical disabilities which attach to a “ separate use” in this state, but which cannot outlive the husband — should be crippled by a trust created only by the executors of her former trustee ; for her own consent and approbation, which she joined in the deed to express, <a id="p284" href="#p284" data-label="284" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*284</a>had then no legal or equitable effect. Perhaps, in the absence of evidence, she has no right to deny that the trusts thus declared were in substantial accordance with those which bound the property in the hands of Robert Ralston, the original trustee. But there is enough on the face of the deed to show that, subject to whatever limitations it creates or repeats, the fund really belonged to her, and not to anybody else. Then we find it limited on her death to the use of such persons as then would have been (say her next of kin), if she had died a widow. If her husband survived her he would have been thereby excluded; if he did not, as the fact is, then the hypothetical and the actual next of kin must coincide at her death. At the present time we have in her, created or submitted to by herself, a life estate, a power of appointment by will, and in default of that, a limitation on her own property to her next of kin. It would not do to apply to such a limitation the strict rules which are intended to protect the bounty of a stranger, which must reach its objects, however capriciously selected.</p>
    <p id="b284-6" data-blocks='[["BL_284.4",284,[275,1138,1169,943]]]'>The solution lies in this. As respects Mrs. Ralston, her next of kin can never be more than volunteers. They will have no rights but such as are derived through her; they will only “represent” her, without any personal claims of their own. Now there is a very material difference between such a case and the common one where the next of kin claims under the will or settlement of a stranger: Tipping <em>v. </em>Pigott, 1 Eq. Cas. Abr. 385. This case has been supposed to have been covertly disparaged in Mansell <em>v. </em>Mansell, 2 P. W. 684, but it is tacitly approved in Moody <em>v. </em>Walters, 16 Ves. 312, and is founded on substantial reason. Eor, to allow the heirs or executors of a settlor, through whose voluntary act alone they can pretend anything, to dispute his acts would be a practical absurdity. See Mackason’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Wright%20330" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Wright 330">6 Wright 330</a>. It is submitted that, as respects both deeds of trust, the appellant being now <em>sui juris, </em>and their objects having ceased, she is entitled to have back the funds which originally belonged to herself, clear of the nominal limitations, which alone now remain in existence. It may be urged that the very term, “legal representatives,” implies a subordination on their part to all lawful acts of the person whom they represent, and that they could hereafter only claim in her right; they could never contest her disposition of the property.</p>

The first deed, of the 4th April 1849, conveyed to the defendant certain stocks and securities therein mentioned, which had been originally held by Robert Ralston, for the sole and separate use of the complainant, then the wife of Ashbel-Gr. Ralston, in trust to receive the income and to pay over the same to the complainant, <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>to her sole and separate use, free, clear, and discharged from the control, interference, engagements, or liabilities of the said A. G. Ralston, her husband, during all the term of her natural life, and from and immediately after her decease to have and to hold the personal property thereby granted for the use and benefit of such persons, and for such estates as she should appoint by 'will, and in default of such appointment “they, the said Lewis Wain and Robert Ralston Dorsey, their successor, or successors in the trust, shall, from and after the decease of the said Eliza Ralston (the complainant), have and hold the personal property hereby granted and settled, or other property or investments into which the same shall or may be hereafter converted, to and for the use and benefit of such person or persons as would have been entitled to the same at the decease of the said Eliza Ralston, as her legal representatives, had she died a widow, under and by virtue of the ‘intestate laws of Pennsylvania.’ ”</p>
    <p id="b287-6" data-blocks='[["BL_287.4",287,[265,1091,1166,430]]]'>We are simply asked to construe this deed of trust, which gives a life estate to Mrs. Ralston, with a power of appointment by will, in default of the exercise of which power it is given to the person or persons who would be her next of kin at her .decease, by the intestate laws of Pennsylvania. There can be no doubt, from the language of this clause, that this is the true meaning of the words “ her legal representatives,” and the provision that they are to take, as if she had died a widow, strengthens this obvious construction: Anderson <em>v. </em>Dawson, 15 Vesey, Jr. 532; Hanson <em>v. </em>Miller, 14 Simons 22.</p>
    <p id="b287-7" data-blocks='[["BL_287.5",287,[265,1523,1163,86]]]'>The trustees under this deed cannot, therefore, be decreed to transfer to Mrs. Ralston, or according to her direction.</p>

Ralston and wife (the present complainant), to the same trustees, demands an entirely different construction of the words “legal representatives,” which here clearly mean executors and administrators. By the very able opinion of V. C. Kindersley, in Re Crawford’s Trust, 23 Law Jour., N. S., ch. 625, 2 Drewry 230, it is clearly shown that the ordinary legal sense of the terms “ legal personal representatives,” “legal representatives,” “personal representatives,” and “representatives,” is executors and administrators. In the present case the words of the conveyance include both real and personal estate, -dot only’of the complainant, but also of her husband, of which he was or might be seised or possessed, by virtue of his intermarriage with her. There is then given a life estate to her separate use, with a power of appointment by will, and in default of appointment, the trustees are then “togrant and convey the said premises, and every part thereof, unto such person and persons as at the decease of the said Eliza (the complainant) shall and may be her heirs and legal representatives.” The word heirs is applicable to real estate, and undoubtedly gives <a id="p288" href="#p288" data-label="288" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*288</a>Mi’S. Ralston, as widow, an absolute estate in fee simple. In the same way the words legal representatives mean executors and administrators, and of course the complainant is entitled to the personal estate absolutely: 2 Wms. on Executors 1015.</p>
    <p id="b288-6" data-blocks='[["BL_288.4",288,[438,564,995,594]]]'>And now, February 19th 1863, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that so much of the decree of the Court of Nisi Prius as dismisses the bill in relation to the relief sought in reference to the deed of the 4th April 1849, be affirmed, the complainant not being entitled to a conveyance from the defendants of the estate embraced in it, and as to the rest of the relief sought by the plaintiff’s bill, the said decree be reversed, and the said defendant’s trustees in the deed of the 25th June 1849, are ordered to convey and assign to the plaintiff all the estate embraced in the said deed and held by them, the said plaintiff being entitled to the same as the absolute owner thereof.</p>
