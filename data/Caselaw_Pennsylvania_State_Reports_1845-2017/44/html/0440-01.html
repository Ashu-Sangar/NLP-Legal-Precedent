No such form of proceeding as this is authorized by any Act of Assembly, or by any usage of legal practice, and therefore we have no rules to govern it. There is a regular and well-known remedy to compel public officers to do their whole duty, and that is by <em>mandamus, </em>and therefore there is no need for inventing a new remedy, and we cannot sanction this one. Sometimes even <em>mandamus </em>is not proper, because the legislature has imposed penalties as the means of enforcing the duty; we do not inquire here whether that is the case here or not. To sanction such a practice as this would be to admit a principle that if carried out would break down all regular practice and all settled law relative to remedies, and leave it all to the mere will or caprice of lawyers, or to the mere arbitrariness of courts. There must be laws of practice as well as laws of general conduct, otherwise all judgment will be mere caprice, and not the application of settled rules to all cases that may arise.</p>
