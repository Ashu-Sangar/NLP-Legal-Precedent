        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered, by\nStrong, J.\nIn Byrod\u2019s Appeal, 7 Casey 241, and in Fisher\u2019s Appeal, 9 Id. 294, it was asserted that where the owner of land encumbered with liens makes a conveyance which is fraudulent as against creditors, a sheriff\u2019s sale, under a judgment subsequently obtained against him, does not disturb the liens existing before the conveyance, and that they are not to be discharged out of the proceeds of the sale. What, then, is sold in such a case ? Not the whole estate of the debtor, disencumbered of the earlier liens, for the land may be sold again as his by executions founded on those liens. In the ca.ses cited, it is said the purchaser at the sheriff\u2019s sale, under a judgment obtained against a grantor after a fraudulent conveyance, obtains the right which the defrauded creditors had, to contest or avoid the conveyance. The purchase-money is therefore the price of those rights, and, as they belonged to all the creditors who held judgments subsequent to the fraudulent deed, it would seem that a junior judgment-creditor cannot appropriate the whole price to the payment of his judgment, on the ground that he was the instrument to effect a sale. Byrod\u2019s and Fisher\u2019s Appeals were ruled as they were to save the liens of judgments from being destroyed by the fraud of a debtor, without payment of the debts, so far as the price of the lands upon which they were liens extends. To prevent the mischief of a divestiture of the liens by a sale under which the debtor\u2019s deed had rendered it uncertain whether the purchaser would obtain any title, it was thought necessary to declare that the purchaser holds, subject to liens prior to the conveyance. Still it is the estate of the debtor, whatever that may be, which is sold at the sheriff\u2019s sale, and therefore the liens upon it which attached after the fraudulent grant must be paid in their order. It follows that the court erred in postponing the appellant\u2019s judgment. Vide Beekman\u2019s Appeal, 2 Wright 388.\nThe decree of the Court of Common Pleas is reversed, the report of the auditor is confirmed, and the record is remitted, costs to be paid by the appellee.",

    "head_matter": "Hoffman\u2019s Appeal.\nLiens, prior to Fraudulent Conveyance, not divested, by Sheriff\u2019s Sale under a subsequent Lien.\u2014 What Estate passes by such Sale. \u2014 Proceeds of Sale distributed among all subsequent Creditors.\n1. Where the owner of land encumbered with liens makes a conveyance fraudulent against creditors, and the land is sold by the sheriff under a judgment subsequently obtained, the liens existing before the conveyance remain, and are therefore not payable out of the proceeds of the sale.\n2. The estate of the debtor is what is sold under the execution ; and those liens only which attached after the fraudulent grant, are payable, in their order, out of the proceeds.\nAppeal from the Common Pleas of Indiana county.\nThis was an appeal by Conrad Hoffman, administrator, &c., of William A. Todd, from the decree of the court distributing the proceeds of the sheriff\u2019s sale of the real estate of William Crawford.\nThe first lien on the land of Crawford, out of which the money in court arose, was in favour of J. & R. McElhose, for $129.29, \u2022 and was entered September 28th 1858.\nOn the 29th of December 1858, Crawford sold and conveyed the land to David Barclay.\nOn the 6th of January 1859, William A. Todd recovered judgment against Crawford for $44.56, and on the 8th of January 1859, Letitia Crawford, under a proceeding for divorce and alimony, recovered a judgment against him for $75 for part maintenance, and $50 annual alimony, with $89.25 costs, under ivhich last-mentioned judgment the property was sold, and the proceeds brought into court for distribution.\nThe property was purchased by Henry Crawford, who, averring that the sale to Barclay had been made to defraud the creditors of William Crawford, brought ejectment against Barclay, and on the 26th of March 1862 recovered judgment upon the ground that the sale to him was fraudulent and void.\nThe auditor appointed to distribute the fund in court applied a portion of it to the payment of William A. Todd\u2019s judgment, and appropriated the balance to the judgment of Letitia Crawford.\nOn the 27th of September 1862, the court below set aside so much of the report as distributed any portion of the fund to the judgment of William A. Todd, and directed that the whole fund (less the costs) be paid to Mrs. Crawford; which was the error assigned by the appellant, to whom, on the death of Mr. Todd, letters of administration had been granted.\nStewart and Olarke, for appellant,\ncited and relied on Byrod\u2019s Appeal, 7 Casey 241, and Fisher\u2019s Appeal, 9 Id. 294.\nTh. $ H. White\ncited and relied on Jackson v.
