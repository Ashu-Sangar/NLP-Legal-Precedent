        "text": "The opinion of the court was delivered by\nRead, J.\nThe only question submitted to us is whether the transaction between Lisle and Edwards was a mortgage or not. If a mortgage, then as the defeasance was not recorded, it was to be treated as an unrecorded mortgage, and as Samuel E. Smith, the subsequent mortgagee, had no notice of its existence, the proceedings under this mortgage vested a good title in the defendants.\nThe words of the paper of the 22d April 1847, signed by George W. Edwards, clearly show that the whole transaction of the deed, the power of attorney in blank afterwards filled up, and the deed to Edwards without any new consideration, constituted only a mortgage. It was in its inception' only a security for the repayment of money and so remained. The court below were therefore clearly right in their charge to the jury.\nJudgment affirmed.\nAgnew, J., dissented and filed a dissenting opinion.",

Edwards, \u2022James M. Smith, and John H. Edwards, executors of the last will and testament of George W. Edwards, deceased, against John M.

Lisle, who by virtue of deed from John Lisle and wife, dated January 23d 1841, and recorded in the recorder\u2019s office of Beaver county, became the owner of th\u00ab whole tract. On the trial the plaintiffs gave in evidence the above deed. They then gave in evidence a written power of attorney from John M. Lisle to Joseph E. Devitt, dated April 22d 1847, recorded in the recorder\u2019s office of Lawrence county, in the book in which articles of agreement, letters of attorney, &c., are recorded, on the 21st day of April 1862, of which the following is a copy:\u2014\n\u201c Know all men by these presents, that I, John M.

Edwards, dated August 21st 1858, for the whole five hundred acre tract, and recorded in \u201c Deed-Book,\u201d on the 25th of August 1858. This deed recited the consideration of \u201c one dollar and other good and sufficient considerations.\u201d\nPlaintiffs then offered will of George W. Edwards, dated August 2d 1861, proved September 4th 1861, devising the whole of testator\u2019s real estate to plaintiffs, and rested.\nThe defendants then showed title to themselves by mortgage John M.

L. McGuffin. The sheriff\u2019s deed and conveyance to defendants, though not given in evidence, were admitted to be regular.\nDefendants then proved by the deposition of Joseph E. Devitt (the attorney named in the above power of attorney), that prior to the date of the deed to George W. Edwards the power of attorney was in blank, that about the time of executing the deed, the blank was filled by Mr. Edwards\u2019s agent, by writing therein the name of \u201c Joseph E. Devitt,\u201d and that the deed was then made by him in pursuance of the said letter of attorney.\nDefendant then gave in evidence the papers of which the following are copies:\u2014\n\u201c 1847.

Lislev a deed for a farm of five hundred acres in Beaver county, Pennsylvania, together with a power of attorney to transfer said farm. This deed is to be held by me as collateral security for the payment to me of the balance due upon four hundred shares of Morris Canal stock, which balance\u2019 will appear upon reference to the receipts which have already passed between us. Upon the said Lisle\u2019s taking up and paying for such stock, this deed with power of attorney to be returned to him \u2014 it being distinctly understood it is only held by me as collateral security for the payment of the balance due me on said four hundred shares of\u2019stock. '\n\u201c Geo. W. Edwards.\u201d\nThis paper was not recorded.\nUpon these facts, the court (Johnson, P. J.) charged the jury that the defeasance of the 22d April 1847, was intended hy the parties to he, and was legally, applicable to any conveyance of the land made under the power of attorney, and that the conveyance, together with the other papers, all together, constituted but a mortgage, and the defeasance not being recorded, the whole should be treated as an unrecorded mortgage, and be postponed to a subsequent mortgage without actual notice of its existence ; and that consequently the defendants were entitled to hold the land. The jury returned a verdict accordingly for defendants, and judgment was entered thereon.\nWhich was the error assigned.\nS. W. Dana, for plaintiffs in error.\nD. Craig, for defendants in error."
