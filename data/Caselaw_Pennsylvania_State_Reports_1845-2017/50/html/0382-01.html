A mere intention to give in the future is neither a contract nor gift, more especially if uncommunicated to the intended donee ; therefore the testimony of Michael Hoover of his conversation with Mrs. Hinney before marriage can have no weight or effect in this action. The money received by Hinney accrued after coverture or marriage, and the wife could make no valid gift to the husband unless in the mode prescribed by said act.</p>

If Mrs. Hinney gave her husband, soon after they were married, $200 as a loan to be repaid to her in one year, there is no reason why it should not bear interest after the expiration of that time ; and the fact that by withholding payment of both interest and principal, <a id="p385" href="#p385" data-label="385" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*385</a>Mrs. Hinney was induced to take a note from her husband on the 1st of April 1860, with interest from that date, will not prevent her recovering the original loan, with interest from its maturity. Any subsequent bargaining or contract between the husband and wife on the subject of interest would not be valid and binding upon the wife. Where a husband receives the money of his wife, the legal presumption is, that he receives it for her use and benefit, and his estate would be liable to account to his surviving widow for the amount received. But if there is evidence to show that the money was given to the husband by his wife as a gift, without any expectation or understanding that the money was to be returned or repaid by the husband, or that his wife should have any claim upon his estate for the same, should she survive hpn, then the widow cannot recover against her deceased husband’s estate.”</p>

There was sufficient evidence to be submitted, and the jury found the fact. It only remains to inquire whether she possessed the power to make the gift. Before the passage of the Act of 1848, securing the separate estate of married women, it was well settled that a wife might dispose of such estate, by gift or loan as well to her husband as to a stranger; and the receipt or use of her money with her consent and without objection or complaint, formed a ground of presumption of a gift to him: McGlinsey’s Appeal, <a id="p386" href="#p386" data-label="386" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*386</a>14 S. &amp; R. 64; Tower <em>v. </em>Hagner, <a href="/whart/3/0048-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Whart. 48" data-case-ids="1833442" data-case-paths="/whart/3/0048-01">3 Whart. 48</a>; Maglee <em>v. </em>Ingersoll, 7 Barr 204. Since the passage of that act, her power over her own estate is not less in this respect than it was before. The provision that her estate shall not be sold, conveyed, mortgaged, or <em>encumbered </em>by her husband, without her written consent, given in the mode provided by the act, is not a restriction upon her own power of disposing of her money or other property capable of transfer by delivery; but was intended to protect her from <em>Ms </em>unauthorized acts.</p>
    <p id="b386-5" data-blocks='[["BL_386.4",386,[249,810,1167,818]]]'>The doctrine of Lancaster <em>v. </em>Dolan, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Rawle%20236" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Rawle 236">1 Rawle 236</a>, and cases in the same class, has no application. It limits her power over trust property to that expressed in the instrument creating the trust. So too, where her power to convey is governed as to the mode by the provision of the law conferring the power, she must execute it in the manner prescribed. But where the property is such that it is consumed in the use or passes by mere delivery, there is nothing in the Act of 1848 forbidding her to exercise her right of control herself. Indeed this absolute power over such separate estate flows from the very language of the act declaring that her property shall continue to be hers as fully after marriage as before, and shall be owned, used, and enjoyed by her as her own separate property. This right does not accrue from any change in the marital relation, or by conversion by force of the act into a <em>feme sole </em>as to her property. On the contrary the relation continues in full force, and still affects her power over some kind of property for her protection. It flows from her absolute ownership and the nature of the property which makes it liable to transmission by the mere act of delivery.</p>
    <p id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[252,1628,1169,332]]]'>It is undoubtedly true that the receipt of the money of a wife by her husband is presumed to be for her use, and the burthen is-cast upon him to remove it by evidence establishing a gift or that it has been expended in the mode, or for a purpose, authorized by her.
