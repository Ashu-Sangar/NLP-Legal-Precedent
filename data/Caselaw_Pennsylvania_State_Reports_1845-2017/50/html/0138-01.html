To August Term 1861 a <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued on it, under which the deféndant claimed the benefit of the Exemption Act, and had set apart to him personal property amounting in value to $300. On this writ $18.22 was made.' Subsequently Margaret Hoshaur issued a <em>fi. fa. </em>on her judgment, under which all the real estate of the defendant was sold to Solomon Gricker for $5005, consisting of a large grist-mill, and farm highly improved with good buildings. Of this sum $4929.72 was paid into court to meet the claims of the defendant and other lien-creditors. Lydia Haldeman was the daughter of Peter Martin, who died in the year 1857, and was married to Dr. Isaac Haldeman about twenty years previous to the trial. Before the death of' Peter Martin, he had advanced to Dr. Haldeman and Lydia Halde<a id="p139" href="#p139" data-label="139" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*139</a>man divers'sums of money, amounting to about $1000. October 11th 1857 the will of Dr. Martin was admitted to probate in Lancaster county, devising his entire estate, excluding advancements (which amounted to $5021.56 after paying all debts), to his five children, including Lydia, in equal shares. It was also shown that the estate of Dr. Martin held a note against Dr. Haldeman for $500, which, with two years’ interest on the same, was deducted from the share of Mrs. Haldeman in her father’s estate. At the time of the appraisement, October 15th 1857, Mrs. Haldeman received from the executors of her father’s estate $175 in specie. January 16th 1860 Isaac Haldeman and wife gave a release to the executors of Peter Martin, deceased, in which they acknowledged to have received $1804.81, in full satisfaction and payment of Lydia’s full share in said estate. Mrs. Haldeman received when the release was given $100 in money from the executors, as part of her share. Dr. Haldeman received money at different times from Dr. Martin, which was included in the $1000 advancement, and was deducted by the executors of Peter Martin from Mrs. Haldeman’s share. It was proved that Mrs. Haldeman at different times had loaned her husband money which she received from her father's estate on a note dated 28th March 1850, for $600 for one year and interest. This note was paid by Dr. Haldeman, giving her another note dated April 1st, 1855, for $780, including interest for one year. For the $500 which Dr. Haldeman had given his note to P eter Martin, and which was included in the settlement with Peter Martin’s executors and Mrs. Haldeman at the time the release was given, January 16th 1860, Dr. Haldeman gave his wife another note, dated April 1st 1860, which two notes, with interest calculated to October 11th 1860 (the date of the judgment in suit), made $1587.03, or $87.03 more than the principal of the judgment in dispute. Dr. Haldeman was attorney in fact for his wife, and as such had general powers granted to him to attend to her estate, by virtue of which he received from John Yundt, one of the executors of Peter Martin, deceased, the note of $500, with two years’ interest thereon, and gave a receipt therefor.</p>

If he exercised the power thus conferred upon him, and reduced the choses into possession during coverture, they became as absolutely his property as the rest of his wife’s personal estate, unless, indeed, he accompanied the reduction into possession with declarations importing his intention to stand as trustee for his wife. In the absence of such declarations, however, the legal presumption which attended reduction into possession was, that the husband intended to exercise his marital rights, and if the wife would set aside this presumption, the burthen of proof was upon her.</p>
    <p id="b140-12" data-blocks='[["BL_140.14",140,[265,1623,1159,599]]]'>But all this was changed by the Act of 1848. Thenceforth marriage was a gift to the husband neither of her chattels in possession, nor of her power over choses in action, but on the contrary every species and description of property owned by a single woman was to continue to be her property as fully after marriage as before, and all property which should accrue to a married woman during coverture was to be owned, used, and enjoyed as her separate property. The statute thus destroyed one great characteristic of the marriage relation, and took away the presumption which at common law attended his accession to her estate, and it shifted the burthen of proof to his shoulders. If a husband receives the money or goods of the wife, the law, since the statute, presumes him to have received them as her trustee or agent, and if he would make title in himself he must prove a purchase or a gift.</p>
    <p id="b140-13" data-blocks='[["BL_140.15",140,[264,2222,1157,215]]]'>And it is immaterial that the marriage was prior to the statute, or that the wife’s estate had descended or vested before the statute: if the receipts by the husband be under the statute, the wife’s title is unimpaired, and his liability to account is fixed: Mellinger <em>v. </em>Bausman, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Wright%20522" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Wright 522">9 Wright 522</a>.</p>

Equally clear is it that such a bond or contract for moneys reduced to the possession of the husband, <em>before the statute, </em>is voluntary and without legal consideration, and will be set aside in behalf of creditors as a fraud upon their rights.</p>
    <p id="b141-6" data-blocks='[["BL_141.4",141,[232,803,1163,637]]]'>This distinction- was well taken, and illustrated in Johnston <em>v. </em>Johnston, I Casey 450, and the fault of the ruling below was, that the cause was not put upon this distinction before the jury. It is strongly alleged, and with apparent support in the evidence, that part of Mrs. Haldeman’s money came into her husband’s hands prior to the Act of 1848, though the greater part seems to have been received subsequently to that enactment. In respect to that which was received before the statute, there were no declarations, as we understand the proof, to qualify the possession of the husband, and his bond for that money, made years afterward, was without consideration, and in fraud of creditors. It was part of his own proper estate, and as such liable for his debts, and could not be given to his wife, though it came from her estate, anymore than he could give it to any other friend to the postponement of creditors.</p>
    <p id="b141-7" data-blocks='[["BL_141.5",141,[231,1450,1164,386]]]'>But in respect to so much as was received since 1848, the bond was well executed, and the attention of the jury should have been directed to this discrimination. The general doctrines of the law were well stated by the learned judge, nor was this distinction wholly overlooked by him, but he did not make it operative in the formation of the verdict. On the contrary, he submitted the cause on the general question, whether the bond was honestly made to secure Mrs. Haldeman for moneys which she had advanced to her husband upon his agreement that she should be repaid.</p>
    <p id="b141-8" data-blocks='[["BL_141.6",141,[226,1837,1166,555]]]'>This was too comprehensive a submission of the case, for unless there was -evidence of the husband’s agreement in respect to moneys received before 1848, <em>made at the time of their receipt, </em>the jury should have been instructed that the bond was void in respect of such moneys; and in respect to the moneys received since 1848, it was error to lead the jury to leave the bond on the husband’s agreement to refund, because, we repeat, the effect of the statute was to raise a legal presumption that the wife’s money, received after and under the statute, was received for her use, and, without an attending promise of repayment, a subsequent bond to secure her would be good against the husband’s creditors. Under the evidence the cause could be submitted properly only by keeping the distinction created by the statute vividly before the jury.</p>

The question was ruled upon the ground that he had assigned his judgment, but quite as good, if not a better reason would have been that he was not a party to the issue and could take no benefit from the verdict.
