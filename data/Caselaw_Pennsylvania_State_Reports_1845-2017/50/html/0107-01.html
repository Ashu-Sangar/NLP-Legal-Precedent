(a. d. 1616), and reported^ in Coke’s Reports, part xi,,p. 93. Bagg was one of twelve chief burgesses of the borough of Plymouth, in England, and having-been guilty of the most scandalous and disorderly speeches to the mayor and his fellow burgesses, was expelled, but the King’s Bench restored him by <em>mandamus. </em>Among other things it was “resolved, 4 that no freeman of any corporation can be disfranchised by the corporation, unless they have authority to do it, either by the express words of the charter or by prescription; but if they have not authority, neither by charter nor prescription, then he ought to be convicted by course of law before he can be removed.’ And in support of this, Lord Coke quotes that famous clause of Magna Charta, beginning 4 <em>JVullus liber </em>homo,’ &amp;c.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b112-14" data-blocks='[["BL_112.12",112,[286,1840,1167,558]],["BL_113.1",113,[209,426,1168,1420]]]'>44 Though much was said about disfranchisement in Bagg’s case, it was really a case of amotion, and not of disfranchisement. Bagg was removed from the office of burgess, and not expelled from the borough by the action of the corporation. Mr. Willcock, in his excellent treatise on corporations, page 270, defines amotion as applicable only to officers, and says it causes ■ a cessation of the particular offices from which they are amoved, but in no manner affects their right to the freedom of the municipality ; whilst disfranchisement is applicable only to the freedom, and cuts off the corporator from all rights and privileges of the corporation. It appears, he says, that there is <em>not </em>an incidental right in corporations to disfranchise their members, but it must be claimed by prescription or express grant of the charter. For this he refers <a id="p113" href="#p113" data-label="113" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*113</a>himself to Bagg’s case, which, he says, has never been expressly overruled; the cases in which it has been questioned having been cases of amotion. He then goes on to make some general observations on the subject, all of which are so excellent, and some of which are so pertinent to the case in hand, that I am tempted to transcribe them. He says: ‘At the time when James Bagg’s case was before the court, their attention had been rarely attracted to the consideration of corporate causes, and the distinction between the right to the offices' and the right to the freedom of a municipality had been little considered. The particular case was of amotion from office; the arguments were in general more applicable to disfranchisement. But there is a material difference in principle. The enjoyment of office is not for the private benefit of the corporator, but an honourable distinction which he holds for the welfare of the corporation, and therefore, though it be an office of a freehold nature, it is entirely conditional. * * * But the franchise of a freeman is wholly for his own benefit, and a private right; a right in the municipality similar to that of a natural subject in the state, of which he ought not to be deprived for any minor offence against his corporate fealty, any more than that for which, as a subject, he ought to be deprived of his franchise as a liegeman. For this reason, all minor corporate offences, <em>such as improper behaviour to his </em>fellow-corporators, where not punishable by the general law of the land, as well as violations of his corporate duties, ought to be punished by penalties imposed by the ordinances of the municipality, and not by disfranchisement. But such offences against the general law as occasion a forfeiture of all civil rights, import in themselves a forfeiture of the corporate franchise; and offences against the corporation which tend to its destruction, such as defacing the charters, altering the corporate records so as to destroy the evidence of their title to privileges, or that of the title of his fellow-corporators to their franchises, are of course causes of disfranchisement.’</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b113-6" data-blocks='[["BL_113.4",113,[213,1848,1166,606]]]'>“ These observations relate to municipal corporations ; but why are they not equally applicable to private corporations ? The interest or ‘ freedom’ which a member has in a private corporation is as truly a ‘ franchise’ as that which any of the burgesses mentioned in Bagg’s Oase had in the borough' of Plymouth, and may often be a much more valuable franchise. Where it has been obtained by the payment of a pecuniary consideration, and property is held in connection with it, it is a vested estate, and certainly ought not'to be sacrificed on account of minor offences, which would not be permitted to forfeit individual interests in a municipal corporation. And if a power to disfranchise in a municipal corporation does not exist unless expressly granted, it is very safe to conclude that it is not inherent in a private corporation, and must have an express grant to support it.</p>

But Bagg’s Case is an authority against the power of disfranchisement no farther than the reasonings therein are entitled to respect, for the point of the case had not reference either to private corporations or the power of disfranchisement.

But does a single instance of disorderly conduct justify disfranchisement ? It is not alleged that the relator is a quarrelsome person, or habitually disorderly.

It was therefore an assault upon Thomas provoked by himself.

Talking or whispering in a reading-room, or wandering from the question in debate, or interrupting another when he is speaking, and very many mere breaches of good manners are disorderly, and injurious to such a club, and fit to be visited by reprimands and fines, but are not such offences against corporate duty as forfeit the franchise. Unless this unhappy occurrence be viewed through an atmosphere of passion and prejudice that shall distort and magnify its proportions, it must be regarded as belonging to the class of minor offences not punishable by expulsion. The relator’s offence was not directed against the society, but against his fellow-member, as in Earle’s Oase and Binns’s Case.
