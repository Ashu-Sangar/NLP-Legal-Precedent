The national government had imposed a national tax upon the borough of Blairsville. Taxes may be in money, kind, or services. This was a tax for services ; a tax falling upon the whole community. It was not a tax or burden upon individuals, for no one was named; nor could it be known upon whom the draft might fall, if the borough failed to fill its quota. The entire community were deeply interested in the services to be performed. Eor taxes, the government gives security to life, liberty, and property. Prohibiting the loaning of credit to a “ party” never contemplated that the legislature and local communities were fettered in the discharge of those great and paramount duties that every people owe to their government in time of war. Our government may, in its necessity, call for our lives and all our property, and we owe both to our country. And shall it be said that a people may not voluntarily tax themselves for a tithe of this property, in time of war, to support their government ? Had the draft taken place, and some, after being drafted had been excused, others had not reported, the community would have been compelled to make good all deficiencies, and the draft would have proceeded until the last man was taken, unless sooner satisfied. How can it be said, then, that the money was raised for a <em>u </em>party ?” The money was raised for the sole and exclusive benefit of the borough of Blairsville, to aid in the discharge of a great public duty, that the laws of the land imposed upon every citizen, without regard to age or condition.</p>

L. 88. It is proper to notice the precise portion to be brought within the scope of our decision, as no opinion should be ventured beyond it. The plaintiff’s bill avers that the defendants are about to contract for and to borrow $5000 in the name and on behalf of the borough of Blairsville, to procure volunteer enlistments by paying to each volunteer a bounty of $300, to fill the quota assigned to the said borough by the last requisition of the president calling for six hundred thousand men, to enter the military service of the United States, and thus to avoid the draft ordered to take place on the 5th of September 1864, and to make payment therefor by the issue of the bonds of the said borough. The plaintiffs suggest their interest as tax-payers, that- the debt of the borough will be greatly increased by the loan, and their taxes largely augmented. The only question before us is, therefore, upon the power of the legislature to authorize the municipality of Blairsville to borrow money and levy taxes for its payment, for the purpose of paying bounties to those who would volunteer to perform the military service due from the citizens of that municipality under an impending but as yet unexecuted draft.</p>

These are ordinary municipal powers of daily use, and when conferred the only test of their validity is, that the object must be public in its nature. Before the amend<a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>ment of the Constitution in 1857 this power was unlimited. Its limitation I shall notice hereafter. Nor is it doubtful in the least degree that this limitation is not a general prohibition to borrow money and levy taxes to pay the same. It would be a startling fact if the people were now to learn from us that a bridge or poorhouse, or a jail or court-house, cannot be built until the taxes have been first laid and collected to pay for it.</p>
    <p id="b159-6" data-blocks='[["BL_159.4",159,[250,710,1173,1590]]]'>The power to create a public debt and liquidate it by taxation is too clear for dispute. The question is therefore narrowed to a single point: is the purpose, in this instance, a public one ? Does it concern the common welfare and interest of the municipality ? Let us see. Civil war was raging, and Congress provided in the second section of the Act of 24th February 1864, that the quota of troops of each ward of a city, town, township, precinct, &amp;c., should be as nearly as possible in proportion to the number of men resident therein liable to render military service. Section 3 provided that all volunteers who may enlist after a draft shall be ordered, shall be deducted from the number ordered to be drafted in such ward, town, &amp;c. Volunteers are therefore, by law, to be accepted in relief of the municipality from a compulsory service to be determined by lot or chance. Does this relief involve the public welfare or interest ? The answer rises spontaneously in the breast of every one in a community liable to the military burthen. It is given not by the voice of him alone who owes the service, but swells into a chorus from his whole family, relatives, and friends. Military service is the highest duty and burthen the citizen is called to obey or to bear. It involves life, limb, and health, and is therefore a greater ££ burthen” than the taxation of property. The loss or the injury is not confined to the individual himself, but extends to all the relations he sustains. It embraces those bound to him in the ties of consanguinity, friendship, and interest; to the community, which must furnish support to his family, if he cannot; and which loses in him a member whose labour, industry, and property contribute to its wealth and its resources ; who assists to bear its burdens, and whose knowledge, skill, and public spirit contribute to the general good. Clearly the loss of that part of the population upon whom the greatest number depend, and who contribute most to the public welfare by their industry, skill, property, and good conduct, is a common loss, and therefore a general injury. These are alike subject to the draft. The blind and relentless lot respects no age, condition, or rank in life. It is therefore clearly the interest of the community that those should serve who are willing, whose loss will sever the fewest ties, and produce the least injury.</p>

It is not voluntary <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>in those who ¡Day it. The community is subject to the draft, and it is paid to relieve it from a burthen of war. It is not a- mere gift or reward, but a consideration for service. It is, therefore, not a confiscation of one man’s property for another’s use, but it is a contribution from the public treasury for a general good. In short, it is simply taxation to relieve the municipality from the stern demands of war, and avert a public injury in the loss of those who contribute most to the public welfare. This is the design of the law, and it is no answer to say that bad men have abused it. The argument which rises, in its conception, no higher than the relief of the drafted man, and asserts that our money should not be taken to pay his debt, if not already answered by the magnitude of the public interest involved, has its reply in the fact that our question presents no such case. In our case it is yet a matter of public concern, the die has not been thrown, the draft is yet impending, and no one knows who will be torn from the community. The case so stood when this bill was filed.</p>

In all these the recipient is directly benefited, while the public interest in many, is not half so imperious or acute as the relief of a community from an impending draft. The pursuit of happiness is our acknowledged fundamental right, and that, therefore, which makes a whole community unhappy, is certainly a social evil to be avoided if it can be. The support of the poor affords one among the best illustrations of what is á municipal or public appropriation of money. The pauper is the party directly and solely benefited, while his pauperism is a public evil, and often is the result of crime. The pauper has not the merit of the volunteer, while the community is injured, not benefited, by his support. There is nothing but a naked public duty performed in his relief. The same may be said of all expenditures of public money in the punishment of crime.</p>

In delivering the opinion, Gibson, C. J., said: “But it is a postulate of the state constitution, which distinguishes it from the Federal, that all the power of the people is delegated by it, except such parts of it as are specifically reserved; and the whole of it is, without exception, vested in the constitutional dispensers of the people’s money. As regards taxation there is no limitation of it. Equality of contribution is not enjoined by the bill of rights, and probably because it was known to be impracticable.” “If equality were practicable, in what branch of the government would power to enforce it reside ? — not in the judiciary, unless it were competent to set aside a law free from collision with the constitution, because it seemed to be unjust.”</p>

The opinion delivered by the present chief justice sustained its constitutionality in forcible terms. After citing the cases I have referred to, he says: “ From the principles recognised in these cases it must be apparent that the exercise of the taxing power by the legislature must become wanton and unjust — be so grossly perverted as to lose the character of a legislative function, before the judiciary will feel themselves entitled to interpose on constitutional grounds.

This then is the next question. The amendment provides that <em>“ </em>The legislature shall not authorize any county, city, borough, township, or incorporated district, by virtue of a vote of its citizens, or otherwise, to become a stockholder in any company, association, or corporation; or to obtain money for, or to loan its credit to any corporation, association, institution, or party.” Granting, for the purpose of the argument, that <em>party </em>here means person or individual, the only part of the amendment to be considered is the clause,” “ <em>or to obtain money for any party.” </em>We have before us no subscription to stock or mere loan of credit.</p>

It certainly does not prohibit the obtaining of money to pay <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>contractors for bridges, paving, market-houses, &amp;c., or to pay labourers, artisans, or material-men engaged upon a public work. In every such case where money is borrowed to pay individuals, it is in a broad sense obtaining money for a party. But the sense of the amendment is evidently a restricted one. Its leading thought is the <em>loan </em>of the public money or credit tp private parties corporated or unincorporated. It is not <em>payment </em>in its proper sense which is prohibited, but the private use or control of the public funds. Payment implies a previous debt or consideration, but here advances or loans, which import no obligation or consideration, are the objects of prohibition. There is not a word in the amendment which interdicts the <em>borrowing </em>of money merely, or the pledging of the public credit for a municipal purpose, to be laid out by authorized public officers or agents. The purpose was to prevent the money of the people from passing into the control of private irresponsible associations or parties, and from being squandered in undertakings of doubtful propriety, or being liable to be lost through the want of integrity of those engaged in its disbursement. It intended to confine the municipal expenditures not only to public objects, but to public officers or agents under their direct responsibility to the municipality. This is seen in the whole section. Therefore the municipality shall not become a stockholder in a corporation or association, for this would be to make it a corporator or partner in the company, and place its funds under -the control of its associates. Nor shall it obtain money <em>for </em>these private parties. If I obtain money <em>for </em>another, I do not mean that I am paying him my own debt. Then I should obtain the money for myself, not for him. If I borrow to pay what I am bound to pay, I borrow for myself. But the expression “ obtain money for” is immediately followed and explained by its adjunct, “ <em>or </em>to <em>loan </em>its credit to,” both being linked together in the same sentence before the object or party, common to both expressions, is reached. The history of the amendment also informs us that subscriptions to stock, and lending the credit of the municipalities to private corporations and associations, were the evils to be remedied. But individuals are always in some capacity the recipients of the public money. It makes no difference, therefore, whether a party paid is a volunteer or a witness, viewer, juror, labourer, pauper, or pensioner. The true question is, whether the money is borrowed for a public purpose, and paid <em>bond fide </em>to a proper person for this purpose, or whether it is money obtained as a loan or advance to the use in all respects of private parties.</p>

The consideration given on his side is most valuable; he enlists into a dangerous service, running the risk of life and limb ; and take upon himself the burthen resting upon the whole community subject to the lot. The public welfare, as I have already shown, is most intimately involved in the draft; which enters directly within the field of municipal affairs. The die is not cast, and the lot is yet uncertain. All are liable within the ages of the greatest capability for usefulness. The chosen may be the most valuable, useful, and needed members of society, whose extradition may produce the greatest injury and the most distress. The public interest is more involved in the ills of a draft, than in many evils recognised as public in their nature. An obstruction to a highway, and a disorderly house, perhaps hurtful to but few, are punished as public nuisances. Even sounds and smells claim public attention. An impending draft is an evil certainly more to be dreaded than the odour of a pig-sty, or the clatter of horns. Can it be that citizens may be torn- from the community, and social ties ruptured, to drag them into a dangerous public service, and yet community cannot interfere to save them on the ground that it is only a private affair ? Their property may be protected from the storage of powder, by municipal regulations; but their bodies cannot be saved from being made food for powder in the public defence. It is possible to hold the disc of the dollar so closely to our eyes, it excludes from sight every object of public interest, and blinds us to every sentiment of humanity. I hold, therefore, that money paid to save a community from a draft is not obtained for a party or individual, but is a direct appropriation to a public purpose, and that raising money by the ordinary powers of borrowing and taxation for a common purpose affecting the interests, happiness, and welfare of a community, is not obtaining money or loaning credit to any party, within the terms of the amendment.</p>

Two invasions of our state, and the character of the war, attest the necessity of this provision. But it is said that protection against invasion and insurrection is a Eederal duty. True, it is so by an express grant of power. But, by the same constitution, every right not delegated is reserved to the states or people; and I find no clause in the constitution by which the right of self-protection is taken away from the states, in all respects. On the contrary, I find that in time of war, or when actually invaded, or in imminent danger not admitting of delay, <a id="p165" href="#p165" data-label="165" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*165</a>the right of the state to keep troops or ships of war is reserved by express exception.

Now, the exception here implies two things: first, that a municipality may be authorized to contract a debt for defence in time of war or of invasion; and next, that such a debt may be assumed by the state. If we suppose a literal difference in the fact that the volunteer goes directly into the service of the United States, yet the motive is state defence; and the means .thus employed not only actually contribute to this purpose, but experience has shown to be most effective to the desired end. In such a war as this has been, wherein is the difference between the strong Federal arm, outstretched for our protection under the injunction of the Federal Constitution, and the feebler hands of the state militia, that we should declare authoritatively that the former cannot be aided by the state while the latter only can be used ? Who has forgotten the mighty shock of arms at Gettysburg, when the whole power of the nation was held in doubtful Conflict by a giant and determined foe; and when, for three anxious days, prayers ascended to the God of battles, and loyal men held their breaths, uncertain upon which side the victory had settled ? It therefore becomes us well to pause before we stand on such narrow ground. Bather should we become humble pupils in that great school of experience which has taught us how near we were to total defeat. In view of these grave realities of war, and of the necessities of defence, how can it be supposed that a free and intelligent people, in avoiding the evils of municipal subscriptions, ran so far into the opposite extreme that they have stripped themselves of the power of incurring a debt in defence of their lives and property at a time of great public exigency ? On the contrary, every line and clause of the exceptions bristle, <a id="p166" href="#p166" data-label="166" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*166</a>as it were with steel, against this artificial, feeble, and unfriendly interpretation.</p>

Then how defend itself ? What provision in the constitution confines state defence to calling out the militia merely ?

There is no conflict of jurisdiction, or of power. Admitting to the fullest extent the incompatibility of any state law assuming to regulate or to interfere with the raising and supporting of a Federal army, there is here no interference, no regulation, and no repugnance. Congress purposely refrained from occupying the whole field of power, and expressly provided for the acceptance of volunteers in discharge of the draft. The Act of February 24th 1864, after providing for the distribution of military service by quotas among the municipalities of each state, declared that “ all volunteers who may enlist after the draft shall be ordered, and before it shall actually be made, shall be deducted from the number ordered to be drafted in such ward, town, township, precinct, election district, or county.” This portion of the field, as to procuring volunteers, was therefore left open to the exercise of any means to induce persons to enlist in relief of the-municipality from the pending, but as yet unexecuted draft. That this was intentional is recognised by the terms of the law. The third proviso of the seventh section, which provides for transfers into the naval service, declares that the bounty money -received from the <em>state, </em>by any mariner or seaman enlisting from that state, shall be deducted from his prize-money. The proviso in the 20th section, authorizing the discharge of minors entering the service without consent of their parents or guardians, expressly requires such persons, their parents or guardians, first to ■repay to the government and <em>to the state and local authorities all </em>

      <em>bounties </em>and advance pay which may have been paid to them. The Federal law, therefore, does not assume to control or direct the procuring of volunteers. It simply suffers or permits the citizens to come forward voluntarily, and accept the service of the men to be drafted, and contemplates that inducements in the shape of bounties will be hel.d out to volunteers by the states and municipalities from which they come.</p>

There is not a single point of conflict. The state bounty operates only upon the will of the citizen to induce him to volunteer, and ends with his acceptance into service. It does not even undertake to determine his fitness to serve, but leaves this to the operation of the Federal law; and this is a decisive answer to the argument that the state bounty throws upon the service unfit persons, while it saves the young and vigorous. If the fact be so, it is an argument to be addressed to Congress to amend its law, or punish the Federal agents. It is a most singular conception that the malpractice of the Federal officials in this respect proves the uneonstitutionality of the state law ; and if it were not uttered with great gravity by counsel of commanding position, I should suspect it of irony.</p>

It was war; so treated by all the branches of the government of the United States; in fact by all foreign powers. In consequence thereof, on the 3d of March 1863, an act was passed by Congress, known as the “ Conscription Law,” by which all able-bodied male citizens of the United States, and foreigners who had declared their intentions to become citizens, between the ages of twenty and forty-five years, were declared to constitute the “national forces” of the country, and made liable to perform military duty as soldiers, when called out by the President for that purpose.

The state is bound to sustain him with the means of living while in it, and the modern rule is, to compensate him also for his services. This, however, is of grace on part of the state ; yet undoubtedly it is his duty to defend it if required, pay or no pay. But it would be a startling assumption to claim that the community, or any portion of it, are bound to contribute money to provide a substitute, to enable him to escape the service altogether!

These alternatives are his, and the public have nothing to do with them. It has no interest in the question of his compensation; the government calling him provides that. If the public can be assessed to raise the means to relieve him from going to the field, or providing a substitute, is this not solely his advantage, and not a benefit, in any sense, to the public ? The inquiry to be answered in this case is simply and singly this, Is it within any grant of legislative power, that the legislature may authorize taxation of the people to pay the debt, or discharge the <em>private </em>obligation of any individual in the community ? I need not argue as to the power of the state over money in its treasury; but can it delegate its power of taxation to a county or township to raise money for a mere private purpose ; for one citizen, or a dozen ? The service of the soldier, it is true, may secure a great public end, but his service is rendered, when required by the government, as a service owing in his own person, and under an obligation resting on him as a man and a citizen, and not on community. The purpose would be no less a private purpose than would an authority to tax the people to pay militia fines, or fines for non-attendance of jurors, or penalties enforced for the non-performance or violations of any statute law. The duty to perform the service or pay the penalty belongs to the individual and not to the public, although the public alone may be benefited by the service. Bounties and gratuities to soldiers are patriotic and commendable undoubtedly, but it is the duty of the government to pay them, if they be deemed necessary; or private liberality should provide them, but it is not a legitimate purpose of a township, ward, or borough to create debts for any such object. While there may be an implied duty to contribute by taxes to <em>local </em>public purposes, and the right to exercise legislative power may possibly be conferred to enable this to be done in some possible cases, yet for <em>private purposes </em>no law can compel it, and the authority of this court clearly stands for this.</p>

And she was forbidden in any manner to pledge or loan her credit to “ any individual, company, corporation, or association, or to become a joint owner or stockholder in any company, corporation, or associationor assume the debt, or any part thereof, of any county, city, borough, or township, or corporation, unless such debt shall have been contracted to enable the state to repel invasion, suppress domestic insurrection, defend itself in times of war, or to assist the state in the discharge of any portion of its indebtedness. So much for the limitations on the legislature in regard to the state. They are clear and plain, and the objects, the security of the people from the dangers of inordinate burthens and taxation, to pay debts contracted under excitement or otherwise, is palpable in every word. The next clause limits the authority of the legislature equally explicitly in regard to the municipal divisions of the state. It is as follows: “ The legislature shall not authorize any county, city, borough, or township, or unincorporated district, by virtue of a vote of its citizens, or otherwise, to become a stockholder in any company, association, or corporation, or to obtain money for, or loan its credit to, any corporation, association, institution, or party.”</p>

State, county, borough, city, and township had grievously sinned in the creation of debts under the constitution. To restrain this disposition, in all time to come, was the object of the people in this legislation. This is the plain, obvious meaning of these provisions, and this is just the rule by which constitutional provisions are to be interpreted: <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20127" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="9 Watts &amp; Serg. 127">9 W. &amp; S. 127</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Wright%20454" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="5 Wright 454">5 Wright 454</a>. The enumerated classes to which the prohibition extends, cover by all fair interpretation every artificial or natural person or thing that can use money. Government, church, state, society, corporation, association, institution, person or persons, are all included in the terms used., If technicality may find any way of escape from the generality of the prohibition, I am not ingenious enough to discover how. But we are not allowed the use of such a process to sap and mine the buttresses of the constitution. It is the legislation of the people we are to deal with, and it is to be read and obeyed in the plain meaning of the words they have chosen to use. This is the judicial rule also, and must be observed. Now, it matters not, in this view of the subject, whether the bounties to be paid by money to be borrowed, by counties, townships, &amp;c., are in aid of the United States, the state, individuals liable to be <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>drafted, "or those who have advanced money to encourage volunteering, or to comply with contracts made with volunteers. All these are either corporations, associations, or parties. A government is a corporation aggregate. It never dies, and it is this that gives it immortality. All its people die in succession, but still it lives ; the king is a corporation sole: 1 Black. Com. 458-9 ; and so is a bishop. Government is also an institution; and if it should ever enter the brain of any school district authority, or supervisor of a township, to lend the credit of his department to the United States, here is, fortunately, authority to prevent it. tí would be, however, to impute an extreme of folly and absurdity to the legislature, far beyond that which might lead to constitutional mistakes, to suppose that the authority to raise bounties was given to aid the government of the ■ United States, already armed with the amplest power, as was said by a majority of this court in the Conscription Cases, 9 Wright, to compel each individual man to enter the military service on its own terms. But even if the folly could be imputed, which decency forbids, the legislature never had the right to grant the power for any such purpose. It was not granted to them to authorize such “ entangling alliances.”</p>
    <p id="b176-4" data-blocks='[["BL_176.4",176,[316,1322,1162,898]]]'>The authority given to these corporations is to borrow money, to repay advancements by individuals and committees, and. to relieve enrolled citizens from the draft. These purposes may not be included in the prohibition to borrow money for any corporation, association, or institution. This is admitted; but it is demonstrably clear “ that any party,” the aid of which is also prohibited, does include all these. Whom do these words describe, if not persons not embraced in the terms “ corporations,” “ associations,” or “ institutions” ? We have seen that these last are large terms, and they embrace every person except private individuals. As the expression “ party” was not used to describe those embraced by the preceding terms, it must have some application, and to what can it have application excepting to the class not embraced by them, which must be unassoeiated individuals ? " The other classes being embraced by the preceding terms, we must give effect to this expression. Nobody ever heard of a constitutional provision being discarded as meaning nothing. This, however, must come to pass before we can find constitutional authority for the borrowing and consequent taxation authorized by these bounty laws. The words used mean unassoeiated or private individuals, or they mean nothing. Such purpose is prohibited.</p>

We say of one, he is a <em>party </em>to be trusted, benefited, or a party proper to be employed, or a party to be avoided, and the like. All these expressions apply as well to individuals as to associations, contractors, or litigants. There is no sense, whatever, in which it can be used in this amendment, but to individuals. But even if there be, the prohibition is no less positive. The power given by the act was to encourage volunteering, no matter whether it be a pecuniary benefit to the party volunteering or to the party who escaped the draft. It was authority to pledge the credit of the municipality to borrow money to be redeemed by taxation, for a <em>u party” </em>and this the people have said, with what effect this decision will show, should not be done.</p>

And it is just in times of public excitement and alarm that such a provision is a protection.</p>

T cannot believe that thus thought the people. It is evident that everything not legitimate to corporate purposes was intended to be forbidden. The words used are broad enough for this. Shall we dwarf their significance to suit the tide of the times ? We ought to have no choice but to give them the construction they ordinarily bear and the effect intended ; this would effectually prevent corporate indebtedness to aid even the Union in carrying on a war, or any other party, outside of the sphere of legitimate municipal operations. It would inevitably condemn such authority as is given by this act and all other like acts.</p>

In one sense, it arises out of a conflict of authority between national and state legislation; or rather it involves the rights and privileges of the citizens of a state, secured by the Constitution of the United States, the benefit of which they may lawfully claim. <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>More distinctly, it is this: Congress has, by express grant, power to declare war, raise and support armies, and <em>maintain </em>a navy. It is invested also with express power to pass all laws <em>proper </em>and <em>necessary </em>to execute these powers. Among these are the right to call for soldiers, and to impose taxes to carry on the operations of the army and meet the general expenses of the war. Roth of these powers Congress had exercised before the passage of any of these acts, and the question now is, can the state authorize a taxation of the people for the same object ? I do not doubt the right of a state to raise money and men to defend herself from invasion; but this must be the real object, and not a pretext. Casuists might argue that the defence of the state is involved in the success of the national arms ; for peradventure in case of failure, invasion might ensue as the result of that failure. But such meaning is inadmissible ; it would justify state armies whenever the necessity for a national army should exist, and thus endanger the defeat of the Federal authority altogether. Whenever a war is waged by authority of Congress, and full power on the .subject by the National Government has been exercised, I cannot comprehend the right of a state to interfere, except in case of actual invasion; and then the interference must be for that purpose primarily, and not secondarily, or as a consequence to flow from want of success against the common enemy. The case of Houston <em>v. </em>Moore, determined by this court, and reported in 3 S. &amp; R. 169, and affirmed in the Supreme Court of the United States, <a href="/us/18/0001-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="5 Wheat. 1" data-case-ids="1442071" data-case-paths="/us/18/0001-01">5 Wheat. 1</a>, has been referred to for an opposite doctrine. This is a mistake. The penalty inflicted by the court-martial in that case was under a state law, copied, it is said, from an Act of Congress; but the action of the court-martial was sustained because the penalty was incurred for disobedience to the orders of the state executive, and before the delinquent had entered the service of the United States at all. The President had made a requisition on the state for a portion of its militia, and, in the process of furnishing it, the offence was committed, and the soldier punished for disobedience to state orders before the Federal authority attached. It was on this ground the case was decided and affirmed in the Supreme Court of the United States. But the opinion of Washington, J., describing a case where Congress has exercised authority, is very direct and in point in support of the position assumed by the counsel for the complainants. “ If in a specified case,” says the <em>judge,“ </em>the people have thought proper to bestow certain powers on Congress as the safest depository of them, and Congress has legislated within the scope of them, the people have reason to complain that the same powers should be exercised at the same time by the state legislatures. To subject them to the operation of two laws upon the same sub<a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>ject, dictated by distinct wills, particularly in a case inflicting penalties, is, to my apprehension, something very like oppression. In short, I am altogether incapable of comprehending how two distinct wills can at the same time be exercised in relation to the same subject, and be effectual and at the same time compatible with each other. If they correspond in every respect, then the latter is idle and inoperative; if they differ, they must, in the nature of things, oppose each other, so far as they do differ. If one imposes a certain punishment for a certain offence, the presumption is that this was deemed sufficient under all the circumstances, and the only proper one. If the other legislature impose a different punishment in kind or degree, I am at a loss to conceive how they can both co-exist together.”</p>
    <p id="b179-6" data-blocks='[["BL_179.4",179,[241,998,1163,1115]]]'>Nothing could more happily express the true idea of the position than this, and goes far to prove its correctness. If Congress impose a tax which it deems sufficient for the war, the people must obey, because they have ordained that the Constitution of the United States, and Acts of Congress passed under its authority, shall be the supreme law of the land. This is their constitution and their delegation of authority. Must they also obey another supreme law emanating from the state on the same subject ? This exercise of the war power was delegated to Congress, and not reserved to the states or people. The people must submit to the authority they have given Congress, but surely ought not to be compelled to submit to a duplicate exaction by the state, much less by every petty municipal authority that the legislature may authorize to try its hand at taxation. Indeed, we have heard an argument of the possibility of a state navy, under, it is true, the idea of a defensive necessity. This idea seemed to me wrapped in a sophism, accidental no doubt, which, in its peculiar connection, was made to assert that defence is often best secured by an offensive movement, and as the state is* authorized to repel invasion she may anticipate it, and send her <em>navy </em>and army abroad to make the assault to prevent the anticipated invasion. This would be good policy on part of a State retaining all its rights and powers over peace and war, but not of a state in the American Union. Such doctrines go far beyond my notion of state rights; but are not at all irrelevant in arguing the point assumed by the defendants.</p>
    <p id="b179-7" data-blocks='[["BL_179.5",179,[245,2113,1161,299]],["BL_180.1",180,[277,442,1157,858]]]'>The harmony of our complex yet simple system of government, is only to be preserved by a strict regard to the operation of its parts, within their assigned limits. A disregard of this will bring, and has brought on, collision between the parts, and will necessarily threaten the evils of discord and perhaps again war. The error in what is contended for on part of the defendants, is in mistaking the right of a state to repel invasion as a war power <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>in all its senses. It is so in a limited sense only; beyond that, the government of the United States has charge and jurisdiction of the matter. A state cannot make war to prevent anticipated invasion. This belongs alone to the Federal Government. The power of the state is by both federal and state constitutions confined to repelling invasion when it attempts to cross her borders. This mischievous act and its confreres have resulted from the error, that the Federal Government either possessed less power than it does, or the state more ; and the interference by the latter, to put the best possible face on it, is to assist the former to raise an army. The former, unfortunately, however, for the exercise of authority by the latter, had fully exercised all the powers it deemed necessary to the end in view; this left the latter without any right to interfere in any manner whatever. This legislation, therefore, in my opinion, can neither stand on the right to find soldiers in relief of the enrolled citizen, nor in the exercise of a war power by the state, not applicable to the case of invasion. Nothing like this was threatened at the time, and there is not the remotest reference in the act to the necessity of soldiers for any such purpose.</p>
    <p id="b180-5" data-blocks='[["BL_180.4",180,[277,1298,1155,430]]]'>These are my views of this momentous question; a question involving a debt — large enough for a nation — to be borne if such views are not to be held for law, by the people of a state burthened by a heavy state debt, by the extravagance of former municipal subscriptions, and by its full share of an enormous national debt. The people have always discharged their duty faithfully to state creditors, and will do so; but it is grievous indeed, if they are to be ground down by impositions against which they have endeavoured, most faithfully endeavoured, but in vain, to provide a protection. I am in favour of granting this injunction.</p>
