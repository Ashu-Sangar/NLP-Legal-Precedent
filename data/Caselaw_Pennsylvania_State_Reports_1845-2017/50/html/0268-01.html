From what is there set forth, it seems that this case is somewhat anomalous. No property now said to he injured was taken by the canal company, whose work was situated at a distance of over two miles from it. But the small stream, passing through the plaintiff’s land, and by which his mills were propelled, was tapped some distance above, and the water taken out by pumping, by which means the quantity, during a portion of the year, was greatly diminished. This first occurred in the year 1834, and long before the complainant purchased the property. No injury was done to the then owner, for he was fully compensated for the diminution by an annual pecuniary recompense agreed on between the parties. That continued to he paid to each successive owner, including the present complainant, down to the year 1855, when the contract expired. It has never been renewed, and the defendant from that time forward continued to take the water without payment. Then for the first time was the owner injured. His property was then diminished in usefulness and value by the act of the defendant, and it is conceded that Mr. Heilman was the owner at that time. In fact, the company would he estopped from denying his ownership, as it had accepted a lease or contract from him to use the water for some ten years previous, and paid him a full annual rent therefor. We have no evidence to show whether this pumping apparatus, by which the water was withdrawn from the stream, was set in operation before a contract was made with the owner in 1834, or whether the contract for compensation preceded the act. In the absence of proof, we must take it for -granted that <a id="p272" href="#p272" data-label="272" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*272</a>they were concomitant, as the 13th section of the Act of 1811 contemplates that,the company, if practicable, shall make an arrangement with the owner by a purchase of his property before taking it, and it is only where the parties cannot agree that an inquest is to be awarded. They did agree in this case; and, even if the same quantity of water was abstracted then as now, yet the owner was not injured — what he failed to receive in the flow of water he was paid in money. The injury was first sustained when the water was withdrawn and the money refused to be rendered.</p>

He has an indefeasible right in that franchise, the water must continue to run as it has been wont to do. Even the state could not deprive him of it without compensation, as it is a mere private creek or watercourse running through the surveyed and granted lands of the people, neither naturally navigable, nor declared so by law. It is as much the property of the landowner as is his spring, or his spring run. There has been no attempt of the legislature to deprive him of his rights, as the law intends that he shall -be fully compensated for any loss he may sustain. His injury and claim for redress, in our opinion, comes within the provisions of the 13th section of the Act of 1811. The lapse of time here is no bar to a recovery; the delay in proceeding is fully accounted for by the facts stated in the petition, and doubtless proved before the inquest. It is a stronger case in favour of the claimant on that point than The Union Canal Company <em>v. </em>Woodside, <a href="/nc/46/0176-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Jones 176" data-case-ids="8681918" data-case-paths="/nc/46/0176-01">1 Jones 176</a>, which was held sufficient. The MS. opinion of Rogers, J., in Canal Company <em>v. </em>Keiser, so much relied on by the plaintiff’s counsel, to show that he is an owner entitled to petition, has, in our judgment, but little application when the facts are examined, as stated in the subsequent report of the same case in 7 Harris 134. There the damage was clearly caused by the erection of the new dam when the petitioner was the owner. This is a case unlike any that have been reported, is one <em>sui generis, </em>yet the principles which govern it are plain and of easy solution. The complainant has clearly suffered a wrong, and the law should afford him redress. It would be a shame and a reproach to the courts to so involve his cause in the meshes of a net of technicalities, as to declare that he had a right without a remedy. He has, as we conceive, sought the proper one under this Act of Assembly, and is entitled to recover his damages as reported by the inquest, which is confirmed, and the exceptions overruled.”</p>

This has, ever since that decision, been accepted as the true meaning of the Act of Assembly. It is within the knowledge of some of us that proceedings to assess damages caused by the construction or enlargement of the canal, have been instituted in the Court of Quarter Sessions of Berks and Lebanon, counties, and that they have been sustained.

In the prosecution of the purpose for which the company was incorporated, power was given to the president and managers to purchase tenements,,mills, millponds, water, watercourses, or other real hereditaments. Power was also given to them to enter upon and appropriate such property without a purchase, with a provision that, in default of purchasing, a <em>venire </em>to assess damages might be awarded, on application of the owner whose property had been taken. The assessment provided for has application only to cases where there has been no purchase. There are no damages to be assessed <a id="p274" href="#p274" data-label="274" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*274</a>until there has been an appropriation, under the power granted by the Commonwealth, and not under a contract with the owner. It is therefore-always a material inquiry, when the appropriation <em>in invitum </em>was made, for it is he who was the owner at that time, who is entitled to the compensation for damages. His subsequent grantee is not a person to whom compensation is due, and he cannot therefore, under the statute, make application for an assessment of damages caused by an appropriation made before his ownership commenced.</p>

The petition avers that the water was diverted in the year 18B4, when John Light was the owner. Had it then been permanently appropriated, without a purchase, a <em>venire </em>might have issued at the suit of John Light, and the damages would have been his. But this was not the character of the appropriation. The petition avers that it was made under a contract with the owner, by which it was stipulated that the company should pay a stated sum per day for each day such diversion of the water (that is, diversion under the contract) should continue. This was in effect a purchase. The petition calls it a permanent diversion of the water. In one sense it was so. The right to abstract the water was under the arrangement to continue, while the company chose to pay the daily compensation stipulated. But whether permanent or no,t, the petition must be taken as an entirety, and if so considered, there is no difficulty in understanding that all that was acquired by the company, or lost by the owner, was the use of the water so long as the company should continue to pay the daily rent. It was so understood by the company. When the water and the water-power of John Light afterwards became the property of Henry Snavely, a similar contract was made with him, and‘when Heilman purchased from Snavely in 1845, the company renewed the contract with the new owner. In 1850 they purchased from Heilman the right to divert the water for five years for a stipulated sum. The petition then avers that whatever rights the company exercised up to 1855, they acquired and held under the successive owners of the land from which the water was taken by virtue of contracts of purchase. And it was not until 1857 that they made any appropriation, in virtue of their power to take property, without a purchase. Under their contracts with the successive owners, the right of the company to take the water did not continue after 1855. The license they previously held was relinquished by them, for they ceased to claim under it, or to recognise the obligations imposed by its continued exercise. The petition avers that in 1857 they first made a permanent appropriation of the water without a purchase. At that <a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>time Heilman was the owner. It is for that appropriation this <em>venire </em>was awarded. "‘In onr opinion it was rightly awarded, for down to 1857 there had heen n$ appropriation under the power granted by the Commonwealth, and, for injury done since, there had been no compensation paid, or secured to be paid by contract. Had the company in 1834 bought a right to use the water for twenty-three years and no longer, it could not be doubted that continuing to use it after the expiration of the term, without an extension of the contract, would be an injury to the person who was the owner when the unauthorized use began, and that then an assessment of damages became his right. Such is in substance the present case. Heilman was the owner when the water was appropriated, within the meaning of the Act of Assembly. The court below was therefore right in refusing to set aside the inquisition, and in confirming the assessment made.</p>
