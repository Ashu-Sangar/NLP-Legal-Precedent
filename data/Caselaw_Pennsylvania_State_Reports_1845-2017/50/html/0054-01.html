These houses were encumbered by building association mortgages. The floating debt was assumed by us when <a id="p56" href="#p56" data-label="56" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*56</a>we took the factory. We assumed to pay all his debts. In January 1854, father concluded to go out of business, and I, individually, agreed to pay the debts due the building associations. We, that is, E., W., and J. Preston, took the factory, and a deed was made to us. A deed was also given to Wallace and John E. for the houses. I paid all his debts that I knew of; all the floating debt of the factory, from $37,000 to $40,000 ; paid every dollar that was presented. I have hunted all the notes I could find. They are the indebtedness of father prior to 1854. Some of the notes are dated after the deed to me. They were given in settling up some old matters, I judge. I paid all the dues to the building associations after father left, in 1854. I paid the mortgages by the dues. The arrangement for fixing up the property was between us boys. There were about twenty houses, ten of them in dispute here. I paid in all $10,000 to $15,000 on all the houses to the building associations. These ten were worth $400 apiece in 1854. They were occupied by the factory hands. They are now worth $700 apiece. Father has not paid anything on account of the houses. He was in bad health when he went away to England in May 1854; he did not expect to return; he is seventy-two years old. He returned in the fall of the year somewhat improyed. He was out of business until June or July 1856 ; then went into business with Kenworthy and Winterbottom; made satinetts, and consigned them to Remington &amp; Co., until they failed in 1857, and that closed them out. We sold to E. Preston, Sr. &amp; Company from $8000 to $10,000 worth of warps, which is not paid. We had no interest in that business. The factory was not worth what we paid. I and my brothers were with him in the factory before he made the deed. I was acquainted with his finances. We knew at the time what debts he owed. I think there is not a debt due in 1854 unpaid. The last instalment to the building association was paid in 1861.”</p>

The recording acts were not made for such creditors. General creditors, before trusting or selling, have no business to search the records. They should go to the property and inquire of the tenants and occupants who owns it. If they don’t do that, but go to the recorder’s office, they spend their money and time for nothing.

What provision had he made for the payment of his debts ? You have the testimony of James M. Preston. If you believe him, he says that the mill and stock and machinery were transferred to the three sons, and they undertook to pay all his debts, and also the building association mortgages on these houses ; and that they have in fact paid them all. Has there been any evidence to show that this is not true ? Any creditors to show a debt not paid ? On the other hand, there is a confirmatory testimony. Several witnesses prove payments to a large amount. Riley proves $15,000, Scull $4200, and other witnesses are called to same point.</p>

If the debt of the creditor by whom the voluntary settlement is impeached, existed at the date of the settlement, and it is shown that the remedy of the creditor is defeated or delayed by the existence of the settlement, it is immaterial whether the debtor was or was not solvent after making the settlement.

We have examined the answers of the court to the third, fourth, sixth, and seventh points of the defendant below, and we see no error in them; and the testimony rejected as stated in the first, second, third, and fourth specifications of error was properly rejected as irrelevant, there being no evidence showing any collusion or <a id="p67" href="#p67" data-label="67" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*67</a>knowledge whatever between the father and 'the grantees, as to the mortgages subsequently made by the father, and nothing was adduced to support the fourth.</p>
