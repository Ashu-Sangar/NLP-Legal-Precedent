Flick, wife of Daniel Flick, went to the eastern cities and purchased goods and organized a business in the town of Somerset, by means which she alleged she owned in her own right. This business, which was one of selling oysters, candies, and liquors, somewhat on the style of a country restaurant, was continued by her up to the time of the levying upon the goods, which constituted the cause of action in this case.</p>

The wife also gave her attention to the business and frequently went to the cities to purchase goods. The stock was kept up by the original capital, investing and repurchasing with the proceeds of the sales.</p>

The receipt of these sums was so long prior to the purchase of the merchandise, that it afforded no adequate ground for a presumption of fact in favour of the wife, and, therefore, there was no error in withholding it from the jury. But in the absence of evidence to raise the presumption of fact, the legal presumption was in favour of the husband’s ownership of all chattels in the joint possession of himself and wife, and the court did no more than give effect to this presumption of law.</p>

We require no unreasonable amount of proof. Absolute demonstration is no more to be looked for in this class of cases than in other lawsuits, and where <em>any </em>evidence is offered from which the conclusion sought can fairly be deduced, it ought to be submitted to the jury, who often decide on less than demonstrative proofs ; but where the only evidence of ownership of money is remote, and there is no proof that what was received, long since, purchased either the goods levied, or those <a id="p268" href="#p268" data-label="268" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*268</a>which were first traded with, it is not error for the judge to withhold the case from the jury.</p>
