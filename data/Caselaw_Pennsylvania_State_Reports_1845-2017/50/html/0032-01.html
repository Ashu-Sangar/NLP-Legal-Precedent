The plaintiffs do not deny their proposition contained in the resolution of 3d April 1860, and the books show an acceptance of the terms by the defendant, and satisfaction received by the plaintiffs. It was a new contract executed and intended to take the place of the old ; it was payment presently, instead of payment by instalments for ten years, and we are to presume it was beneficial to the plaintiffs, if this be necessary, as they received it on the terms of their own offer, and made no objections on that ground then, nor since. The payment by stock was a mode of payment of the loan <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>which was a debt due. A different mode of payment was proposed by the plaintiffs, and accepted by the defendant and executed, which was to apply the value of the stock to the loan and to pay the balance in cash. The defendant acceded to this and executed it. This was either payment direct or it was accord and satisfaction. It would be a fraud on defendant to allow the plaintiffs, after availing themselves of the fruits of the new contract, to insist on the old. The elementary principle is, that satisfaction agreed on between parties, when performed, is a bar to all actions on account of the matter agreed about; 3 Black. Com. 15 ; Bac. Abr. tit. <em>Accord and Satisfaction; </em>2 Pars, on Contracts 193; 2 Greenl. Ev. § 28.

There was no dispute, therefore, about the agreement between the parties as evidenced by the resolution, and payment by the defendant. The latter appeared on the plaintiffs’ books. After a <em>remittitur </em>of a portion of the sum found by the jury, the learned judge ruled the reserved point in favour of the plaintiffs, thus holding that the agreement and satisfaction was no bar, but for what reason we are not informed. It was not because the resolution was void, I apprehend. The association could not allege that, and at the same time hold on to all it had received under it. They must not play fast and loose in that way. The ground taken in argument seemed to be, that the institution was injured by the defendant’s withdrawal from it. But he did so on the terms offered by the plaintiffs, and paid them off in advance of the time in which by the rules of the institution he was bound to pay. If I understand the constitution, any member may withdraw on the terms there provided. But that is of no consequence here, for the authority was by special resolution. The object was to facilitate winding up, and was clearly agreed to at the stockholders’ meeting, and no objection of the kind in, or by the institution appears since. As, therefore, the association has reaped the advantages of it, they are estopped from denying its validity now, as they have not proposed to place the defendant <em>in statu quo </em>in order to avail themselves of such a defence.</p>
