Shank, she became liable to pay a large sum of money, almost equal to the whole of her estate. That her liabilities on this account came upon her so suddenly and unexpectedly that she was troubled, not knowing the extent or amount for which she was liable, or how best to meet it. That whilst thus distressed, her said son-in-law, the defendant, offered his advice and assistance to relieve her of her said trouble. That he represented to her that her liabilities and endorsements, being bank debts, could and would be immediately prosecuted to final judgment; that no stay or time for payment could be obtained ; that the same would be sold by the sheriff for such inadequate sums as to be wholly insufficient to pay her said liabilities ; that she would thereby become impoverished, and a <em>pauper; </em>and that if she would transfer and assign her property and estate to him, he would so manage the same that she would be fully relieved and protected in the premises. That she at first refused, but that he urged it upon her as the only means by which she could fully protect herself and her creditors. That she was also advised by others of her neighbours and friends to assign her property to the said defendant, who she believes were influenced and instigated thereto by his procurement. That on or about the 25th November 1859, he induced her to come to his residence in the night time ; that he had then and there certain writings for her to sign .and execute, the purport, tenor, or effect of which she did not know or understand, nor were they read or explained to her. That she then believed they were such powers and assignments as would enable defendant to manage her property for the benefit of herself and creditors. That she did not intend to make any sale, conveyance, or transfer of any of her property with intent to defraud, hinder, delay, or embarrass any of her creditors, but that she always intended, and still intends, to the extent of her <a id="p241" href="#p241" data-label="241" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*241</a>estate, to pay all her debts, in whatever way contracted. That she has since discovered, as nearly as she can ascertain, that the said writings which said defendant caused her to sign, are the following, to wit: A judgment-bond, dated November 29th 1859, to said defendant, in the penal sum of $2746.22, conditioned for the payment of $1173.11, January 1st 1860, with interest, with warrant of attorney to confess judgment annexed, and which defendant caused to be entered in Dauphin Common Pleas, to No. 166, January Term 1860 ; a letter of attorney to James W. Weir, Esq., authorizing him to transfer, on the books of the Harrisburg Bank, all her stock in said bank to said defendant — in pursuance of which defendant procured the transfer to him of all her stock in said bank, to wit, forty-four shares; that the said stock was of the par value of $25 per share, and of the marketable value of $33 per share, together amounting to the sum of $1472 ; a release of her dower as widow of Jacob Hershey, deceased, charged on certain lands owned and in possession of the said defendant, in right of his wife, of the yearly value of $237.07, of which release she was only conscious by subsequent information from the defendant, and by his refusal to pay her any portion thereof, and claiming the same as his own property and estate.</p>

An agreement void by the statute, as to creditors, is to be administered, as between the parties themselves, like any other agreement, and therefore may be impeached for actual fraud: Buehler <em>v. </em>Gloninger, <a href="/watts/2/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="2 Watts 226" data-case-ids="1840075" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0226-01">2 Watts 226</a>; Sherk <em>v. </em>Endress, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0255-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 255" data-case-ids="1854669" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0255-01">3 W. &amp; S. 255</a>. If the question here were upon <em>enforcing </em>the agreements, there can be no doubt that Mrs. Hershey might avail herself of the fraud she complains of, provided always she could establish it to the satisfaction of a jury; but between <em>enforcing </em>and <em>cancelling </em>an agreement there is a distinction as palpable as that between an <em>executory </em>and an <em>executed </em>contract. And the ground upon which courts of equity proceed in rescinding or cancelling executed contracts is much more narrow than that upon which they refuse specific performance of an executory contract, or even decree its cancellation. Still, actual fraud <em>is </em>a ground of cancellation in equity: Graham <em>v. </em>Pancoast, 6 Casey 99, and Nace <em>v. </em>Boyer, Id. 99.

Who does iniquity shall not have equity. If we could entertain your suit, the fraud practised upon you might be redressed; but equity has no relief for a party who, in the practice of one fraud, has become the victim of another. The old cases often gave relief, both at law and equity, where a party to a fraudulent contract would otherwise derive an advantage from his iniquity; but the modern doctrine has adopted <a id="p245" href="#p245" data-label="245" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*245</a>a more severely just and probably politic and moral rule, which is, to leave the parties where it finds them, giving no relief and no countenance to contracts made in violation of statutes.
