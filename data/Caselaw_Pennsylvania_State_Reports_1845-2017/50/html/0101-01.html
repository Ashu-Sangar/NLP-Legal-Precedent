Keziah having died without leaving <a id="p103" href="#p103" data-label="103" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*103</a>any other child than Mrs. Tyson, who left no issue, and her husband, since deceased, not having reduced the claim into possession, there would seem to be no one standing in the way of the plaintiff to a share of the $303.87, as heirs or next of kin, if it has not been paid. But it is contended by the defendants, that, even supposing this'money never has been paid, the plaintiff has mistaken his remedy. That the sum of $303.87 constituted a part of the personal estate of Keziah Henderson, and passed on her death to her daughter Mrs. Tyson as such. That it vested in Mrs. Tyson, and consequently the plaintiff must claim through her ; but being personal estate it could only be recovered by her administrator, even if an administration on the estate of Keziah could be dispensed with. It does not appear that Mrs. Tyson, afterwards Traquair, left no debts. How her cousin can maintain an action to recover the assets of her estate, consistently with the policy of the law and without infringing upon the rights of creditors, is not perceived, unless a recovery in this case by him could be successfully pleaded by the defendants in an action brought by her administrator, which, it is believed, could not be done. He has given no security, and if he were permitted to recover he would incur no responsibility to any one. [To sustain this action at the suit of the plaintiff would sanction an improper interference with the administration of an intestate’s estate.] And with a view to sustain it the court cannot <em>t </em>go into an inquiry as to the indebtedness of the decedent, which must, in many instances, be attended by unsatisfactory results.</p>

They had a lien it is true, but it could not be enforced by distress, a right conferred on the widow by the Act of Assembly- But no matter in what character it may have been received by Keziah, it would be treated as personalty in the hands of her daughter.,</p>
