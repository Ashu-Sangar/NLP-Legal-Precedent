Every presumption is, that she intended to use the words “ right heirs” in their technical sense, as words of limitation, and there is nothing in the will to rebut the presumption, except the fact that the gift of the remainder was to “right heirs,” their heirs, executors, &amp;c. But superadded words of limitation have never of themselves been held sufficient to convert the words of limitation to which they are added into words of purchase. The most that can be said of them is, that they are ■superfluous. They are not inconsistent. Words of distributive modification may be inconsistent with a, gift to heirs <em>as such, </em>and hence, it has sometimes been held that a gift to “ heirs of the body,” or even “heirs,” in England (where the oldest son takes in exclusion of his brothers and sisters), if followed by added words of limitation, and by words of distributive modification, may amount to no more than a gift to children. Together, they overcome the presumption that technical term's are used in a technical sense; alone, neither of them is sufficient: Smith on Executory Interests 488.</p>
