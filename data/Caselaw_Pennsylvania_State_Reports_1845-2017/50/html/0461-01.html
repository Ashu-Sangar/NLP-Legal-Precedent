They may have their squabbles about rent, the possession, repairs, taxes, or what not, but except in cases of fraud, or conveyance oJ; title by the landlord, they never can come in conflict upon a question of title, not even when a new landlord, to whom the tenant has attorned, appears in the field: Boyer <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Watts%2064" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Watts 64">5 Watts 64</a>. In possession under and by virtue of the title of his landlord, the tenant can neither dis]mte it himself nor assist others to contest it. If sued in ejectment, it is made his duty by the old Act of 1772 to give notice thereof to his landlord <em>forthwith, </em>under penalty of forfeiting the value of two years’ rent, and it is one of the rights of the landlord to appear and defend such suit “ by joining with the tenant.”</p>

Nor were the court ignorant that E. B. Leonard, Jr., proposed to defend in character of tenant of his father, for in both his special pleas, the original and tlie amended,, the tenancy is very distinctly averred. Then he should not have been treated as a defendant having a separate interest to defend, and the learned judge fell into error, when he suffered a confessed tenant to sever, in pleading, from his landlord.</p>

This plea also consists of two parts : a confession of judgment as to the three-story brick house, and a plea of not guilty as to all the rest. We can make nothing more out of it than this.</p>

It was his duty to plead the general issue, both because the statute enjoins it, and because it was the only plea that could protect his landlord’s title. Not guilty is the general issue in ejectment at common law, and it shall be the plea in ejectment, saith our Act of 1807, Purd. 366. More words were employed than were necessary to place this plea upon the record, but they amount to just the statutory plea — ■ nothing more, nothing less. And just that was the plea of the elder Leonard. Where, then, was the severance ? As to the brick house there <em>was </em>a severance, which amounted to nothing, however, for a confession of judgment by a tenant for years touches not the title ; but as to the rest of the premises, the two defendants placed the same plea upon the record.</p>
    <p id="b475-6" data-blocks='[["BL_475.4",475,[290,1052,1168,949]]]'>Seeing, then, that the tenant had no interest to defend that was not identical with that of the landlord, and that their pleas were identical, the next observation to be made is, that if the court had a right, in the exercise of a sound judicial discretion, to order separate trials, they did not make the trials separate. As we understand the record, one jury only were sworn to try the issue as to both defendants. On the 24th of January 1865, after the plaintiffs had closed their testimony, the court directed the jury to find a verdict for Edward B. Leonard, Jr., “ on the ground that he never was in possession of the premises mentioned and described in his plea of not guilty.” Was this right ? I hold that it is competent for a defendant in ejectment to defend himself from all the consequences of an adverse verdict, by showing that he was not in possession of the premises at the service of the writ or since. “ The’ consent rule,” which was invented to dispense with proof of lease, entry, and ouster, is now altered by orders of the different courts in England, so as to include the confession of possession as well as of lease, entry, and ouster, and therefore no proof of possession is required in those courts, unless there should be some dispute as to the identity of the premises, when the consent rule must be produced: Adams on Ejectment, 4th Am. ed., p. 319.</p>
    <p id="b475-7" data-blocks='[["BL_475.5",475,[293,1998,1168,474]],["BL_476.1",476,[245,445,1163,214]]]'>But with us the law is not quite so. We have dispensed with the consent rule by sweeping away the fictions of lease, entry, and ouster, and placing the parties in ejectment upon their respective titles. The plaintiff, however, must still prove the defendant in possession. The 2d section of the Act of 1807, Purd. 365, makes the return of the sheriff, that he has served the writ of ejectment, evidence that all the parties served are in the actual possession of the premises. In Gratz <em>v. </em>Benner, 13 S. &amp; R. 110, it was attempted to restrict this section to persons found in possession by the sheriff AYho were not named in the writ, and the terms of the enactment favoured the argument; but Chief Justice Tilghman <a id="p476" href="#p476" data-label="476" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*476</a>declared that immediately after the passing of the act and ever since, a construction has prevailed which extends the evidence, arising from the sheriff’s return, <em>to all of the defendants. </em>To the same effect see Cooper <em>v. </em>Smith, 9 S. &amp; R. 26, and Dietrich <em>v. </em>Mateer, 10 Id. 151.</p>
    <p id="AOeW" data-blocks='[["BL_476.4",476,[242,663,1164,975]]]'>The plaintiff, therefore, proves the defendant in possession when he gives in evidence the service of the writ, hut it is only <em>primd facie </em>evidence, and may he rebutted. Its effect is to shift the <em>onus </em>to the shoulders of the defendant. He must prove, after the sheriff’s return is in evidence, that he is <em>notin </em>possession, and that proved, he is entitled to a verdict for his costs. But as it is in its nature a question of fact, it must be proved to the satisfaction of the jury and is not to be found by the court. The plea of Leonard, Jr., concluded to the country, and this ground of defence was peculiarly within the province of the jury. It cannot be said there was no evidence to submit to them, for there was first, the sheriff’s return with its legal effect as stated above, and then there were the declarations of Leonard, Jr., to Hackett in reference to the property on the railroad — the six-acre lot as we understand it — that that property was his ; that his uncle William (the late owner) had written a letter to him, if he would come over and stay with him, he would give him that property ; that he had come over and now intended to claim it; that he would see if he could not hold it. And next there was the evidence of Samuel Hoover, who swore that whilst his brother was tenant of William Leonard’s railroad house and lot, he saw Edward B. Leonard, Jr., there, superintending property, planting trees, &amp;c., after William Leonard’s death.</p>
    <p id="b476-7" data-blocks='[["BL_476.5",476,[242,1649,1159,341]]]'>There was other evidence to the same effect from witnesses on the part of the defence, but the above evidence was all given on behalf of the plaintiffs ; and was before the court and jury when the learned judge directed a verdict for Leonard, Jr., on the ground that he was not in possession of any of the premises except for the house in respect to which he had confessed judgment. In that direction, there was manifest error. The question should have been submitted to the jury.</p>

In other words, was there anything apparent in the case which called upon the court to exercise their discretion to give the defendants separate trials ? When a plaintiff in ejectment includes unnecessary parties in his suit, merely with a view of shutting their mouths as witnesses, his suit is, as to such parties, vexatious, and ought to be disposed of like other actions of trespass against several defendants, only some of whom are guilty. The practice is, to take a verdict for defendants in trespass, against whom the plaintiff has failed to make out his case, and to take it, pending the trial against other parties, and I see no objection to applying this prac<a id="p477" href="#p477" data-label="477" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*477</a>tice to actions of ejectment. Whether such a verdict in ejectment would qualify the acquitted parties to testify for their fellow-defendants will be considered when a case presents it fairly, but for the present, it is enough to say, that we do not think this case was ground for a just appeal to the discretion of the court for separate verdicts. The plaintiffs were not bound to show that the defendants stood in the relation of landlord and tenant, and finding them both in possession of premises, which the plaintiffs claimed to own, there was nothing vexatious in including both in the writ. But though they were landlord and tenant, we have seen that they were in, under one and the same title, and that there was evidence of Leonard Jr.’s possession of more than the house and lot occupied by him. Then to these considerations, add the great fact that the titles of the parties litigant, depended on the alleged spoliation by both defendants, but especially by Leonard, Jr., of the will of William Leonard, deceased; and is it not apparent, that if ever there was an ejectment, in which two defendants should have been placed before a jury on the same evidence, this was that case ? To judge of the soundness of the discretion exercised, may not be our appropriate duty, but whether it was a case for the exercise of a judicial discretion is an appropriate question for us,' and when we look at all the circumstances, and especially at the fact that a will was made by William Leonard for this property, in favour of the now deceased husband of Mrs. Helfenstein, and that she alleged, upon testimony more or less convincing, a fraudulent destruction of that will by the defendants; we cannot esteem her joinder of these defendants* one of those unnecessary and vexatious uses of process, which demanded or justified the interposition of the judge. He should have allowed the cause to take the ordinary course.</p>
    <p id="b477-6" data-blocks='[["BL_477.4",477,[259,1728,1167,646]]]'>Had he done so, there wrnuld have been no question about the competency of Edward B. Leonard, Jr., as a witness, for he would not have been offered. As the record stands, however, this question is raised, and we despatch it by saying that on two grounds— the public policy which excludes a party to the record, and the interest which springs from liability for costs and mesne profits— he ought to have been excluded. We decided a case on these principles at Pittsburgh last fall, which was ejectment against three— a confession of judgment by one of the defendants, and an offer of him as a witness for his fellows. There was no verdict and judgment for one of the defendants, pending the trial as against the others, and in this particular that case is distinguishable from the present, but the reasonings and authorities in the opinion of my brother Agnew cover the question here. See the case of The Cambria Iron Company <em>v. </em>Tomb, <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Wright%20387" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="12 Wright 387">12 Wright 387</a>.</p>

The third assignment of error does not deal quite candidly with the" judge, for it breaks off the thought which he was expressing, at a copima, and omits all the rest of the sentence which he employed to express his thought. We think it incontrovertible law, that when a will is shown to be in possession of a testator, and cannot be found or produced after his death, the legal presumption, in the absence of all proof on the subject, is, that it was destroyed by the testator; but this presumption may be rebutted by evidence tending to show a spoliation by others, either in the lifetime or after the death of the testator. This is exactly what the court laid down.</p>

Leonard, Jr. Without discussing the effect of the evidence, we decide that there was no error in this answer of the court.</p>
