I was not sent for that day. Ross White asked me to come out some day, and I went a week or two afterwards, and took my little children along. It was at no time fixed by me or White. On the matter of this will, I saw Ross White only once or twice. I was doing business for Loudon, and Ross White was his agent. I told him to tell Loudon, I thought he had better write a new will. I wrote a former will, and some time after that a codicil. I did not see Ross White when I wrote the codicil, but sent it out. It was written because one of the legatees died. I sent Loudon word to write a new will, because I wanted him to be present at the time I wrote it, and to see him execute it. I wanted his will to have no codicil. I had intercourse with White in relation to Loudon’s other business, but not but once or twice in relation to making a will. I had not blocked it out beforehand. The <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>most of the formal part of this will was taken from a former will I have now in court. When I wrote the former will, Loudon resided with Ross White. . This former will was executed in Ross White’s house. I can’t tell how long after Mr. Loudon .went to Ross White’s house he had this will executed — former will. This is the first will I know anything about. Never saw any other. The first will was written after night, after we returned from fishing. I think Ross White asked me to come up and write this first will. Ross White paid me as agent of Samuel Loudon. He was doing business as agent, and I was the attorney. I think Ross White paid me for this, and paid me all the fees I got, and for the collection of money and for suits. It was in the year 1859, 30th of August. Mr. White told me, after the first will was written, and before the second, that Mrs. Curry was deceased, and Mr. Loudon wanted me to write a codicil to that will revoking that legacy. I wrote it and sent the codicil out.”</p>

By its provisions, ‘ every will shall be in writing, and unless the person making the same shall be prevented by the extremity of his last sickness, shall be signed by him at the end thereof, or by some person in his presence, and by his express direction, and in all cases shall be proved by the oaths and affirmations of two or more competent witnesses,’ &amp;e.</p>

B. Buehler, from the 3d, 4th, 5th, 7th, 8th, and 9th pages of their notes, and the testimony of Mr. Mclntire, from the 5th, 6th, 7th, and 10th pages of their notes.] “ On this testimony the question of the proper attestation of the will depends. If you credit the testimony of Mr. Buehler that the will was written, as he states, in accordance with the directions given by Loudon, that it was either read to him* attested and signed by both Buehler and Mclntire, at the instance and request of Mr. Loudon, or that Mr. Buehler asked Mr. Mclntire, in Mr. Loudon’s presence, within his hearing, and with his assent, to sign it as Mr. Loudon’s will, and that Mr. Mclntire did so sign it, the law would presume that it was duly attested, if the memory of Mr. Mclntire on this subject is either wholly or partially gone. And especially would this be so, if the jury believed (as Mr. Mclntire testifies) that the request was not made in a whisper, but loud enough to be heard by Loudon; and that, in accordance with this request, Mclntire did sign it as a witness. If this is so, we say again that the law will presume that everything else existed to give validity to its execution. It is true the rule is different if the witness is able to recollect that things essential were positively wanting; for when such is the case the presumption of the law is the other way. In the present ease, ■however, the defect of the witness seems to be in want of recollection, or failure of memory. How it is, the jury ¡will decide from the evidence.</p>

One of them recollects all about it, and testifies that he wrote it, and subscribed it as a witness, at the request of the testator, and thinks that the other, whom he called in for .the purpose of attesting the will, subscribed at the same moment of time he did, and also at the like request. The seeming difficulty in the case is, that the second witness cannot remember that he saw the testator sign, or who called on him to be a witness, or that he heard him say anything: but he does recollect that he saw nothing that would induce him to doubt that he was of sound mind and memory, and that he did subscribe as a witness. From this state of the testimony, it is supposed that the proof did not come up to the requirement of the statute, which .provides “ that in all cases, it (the will) shall be proved by the oaths or affirmations of two or more competent witnesses, otherwise it will be of no effect:” Act of 8th April 1833.</p>
    <p id="b359-10" data-blocks='[["BL_359.12",359,[245,1721,1166,729]],["BL_360.1",360,[264,456,1165,689]]]'>In some sense, statutes of wills, prescribing forms and solemnities to be observed in executing and proving them, are statutes of frauds, for the object of all these things is to prevent fraud in setting up as testamentary that which may have been obtained by imposition, coercion, undue influence, or from want of mind and memory equal to the task of making a rational disposition of property. But the form sometimes necessarily stands as evidence of the fact to be established through its medium. For instance, according to the English Wills Act of 1838, the will was required to be subscribed by the authenticating witnesses, and it followed, of course, when any or all became deceased, the will could only be proved by proving their signatures. So with us, the proof of execution, where there are subscribing witnesses, is precisely the same although the requirement of subscribing is not the same. It is just the same as is the proof of any common law contract, where the name of the deceased witness stands for his solemn declaration that it was executed as it appears. This is the <em>frimá facie </em>case <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>made by such proof, and if not overthrown becomes conclusive. No doubt the credit thus given to the attesting name rests upon the presumption of the honesty of the transaction until the contrary be made to appear ; and this presumption applies to every portion and part of the instrument. As witnesses do not live always, the rule must either prevail or instruments requiring attestation must fail in process of time, or their testimony be perpetuated in some mode. But it does prevail, and is I believe without exception in its universality. The same rule applies where the subscribing witness is insane, absent, infamous, or interested. Proof of his handwriting is all that is required. But where he is within the jurisdiction of the court and otherwise competent, he must be called, although he has forgotten all about the transaction — a circumstance not at all uncommon. His recognition of his signature proves the instrument in the first place, and it stands until, like any other fact, it is disproved.</p>

Eor the reasons given and the authorities cited, the proof was sufficient: it was by two witnesses, one of whom recollects distinctly that the other, who does not recollect, did sign in the presence of the testator, and whose very attestation is to the declaration that he subscribed at the request of the testator, and in his presence. If both had been equally oblivious of what had passed, still if they had, as did this one, both recognised each his signature, it would have been sufficient. No error was committed on the trial, and the judgment is therefore affirmed.</p>
