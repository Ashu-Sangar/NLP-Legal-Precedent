Attachments in execution were issued on the judgments, and the money due by Snyder to Swanger had been attached. The process was not served on Swanger, who <a id="p219" href="#p219" data-label="219" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*219</a>resided out of the county, but notice was given him by Snyderj with a request for him to attend to the cases and make defence, if any he had. This was not done, and Snyder put in answers, under a rule, admitting the amount of money in his hands due to Swanger, on which the court on motion rendered judgments in favour of the attaching creditor for the amount of those debts, leaving a small balance still due to Swanger. This money was paid on the attachments, and the present, defendant claimed a credit therefor in this action. This was objected to on the ground that the proceeding was irregular, in this : that no execution was issued and returned <em>nulla bona </em>before the attachments issued, and that the present defendant should have set that up as a defence against the attachment.</p>

That, it is averred, was done here, which is a fact for you to decide. The objection to the want of an execution from the justice is <em>purely </em>technical, even if it applies to this case. The Act of Assembly says that <em>‘ </em>no <em>fieri facias </em>shall issue,’ &amp;c., which this attachment in execution is not. Yet some respectable courts have held that such process is within the spirit -and intention of the act, which we will now take for granted, yet as the provision is introduced for the benefit of the defendant it may be waived. Had Swanger resided in the county, and been served with process, he was bound to make this defence himself, not throw it on the garnishee, and if he was notified by the latter, and requested to defend, he was bound to do so, or inform the garnishee of the facts relied on. Such process is not void, but may be cured by acquiescence: Dunn <em>v. </em>Fries, 4 L. J. 473 ; Moore <em>v. </em>Risden, 5 Id. 429; and after the judgment on the transcript has been revived by <em>scire facias </em>in court, no execution and return of the magistrate is necessary: Green <em>v. </em>Leymer, <a href="/watts/3/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Watts 381" data-case-ids="1841284" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0381-01">3 Watts 381</a>. It has been repeatedly held that such defect would not avail in an action of ejectment founded on a sheriff’s sale, as it should have been raised at the earliest day, and before the acknowledgment of the sheriff’s deed. It is considered so purely technical that none but the debtor couid take advantage of it, and therefore other creditors could not say that the process was void. [We are of the opinion that if Swanger had notice, he should have interposed this defence himself, and cannot now say that the attachments were void — they are at most only <em>voidable, </em>and he has the judgment of the court against him, which protects the present defendant.] We will answer the points:—</p>

The most that can be said of <a id="p223" href="#p223" data-label="223" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*223</a>such attachments is that they are irregular, and even that may he doubted. They are quite unlike writs of <em>fieri facias, </em>for they are required to be served upon the defendant when he is a resident of the county in which the attachment is issued, and the defendant may have a day in court. The Act of Assembly does not in words apply to attachments, and they do not seem to be within its spirit, when the defendant has an opportunity to be heard in opposition to the claim of the attaching creditor. The prohibition of the act is no more positive than is the second section of the general Act of 1836, relating to executions, which enacts that no execution shall be issued upon any judgment, unless the party against whom it shall have been rendered, his heirs, executors, and administrators, shall be first warned by a writ of <em>scire facias, </em>yet this has been held not to prohibit an attachment-execution: Ogilsby <em>v. </em>Lee, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20414" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 414">7 W. &amp; S. 414</a>; Gemmill <em>v. </em>Butler, 4 Barr 232. In these cases the attachment-execution was treated as not even irregular. Conceding, however., in this case that the attachment was irregular, and that it might have been avoided, we think the court was right in holding that the plaintiff in error, who was the defendant in the attachment-execution, is not to be heard now in asserting its irregularity. <em>* </em>If he had notice of the attachment, and still suffered judgment to„go against the garnishee, he waived his fight to object that the writ issued erroneously. It may be that the garnishee may take advantage of irregularities in the proceedings on the attachment, and that he would be liable to the debtor if he paid over the money in his hands on an unsound judgment. This is all that was said in Skidmore <em>v. </em>Bradford, 4 Barr 296, but the judgment against Swanger, on which Snyder paid over the money, is not alleged to have been unsound. A <em>scire facias </em>confessedly might have been issued upon it, to which Swanger would have had no defence ; Green <em>v. </em>Seymour, <a href="/watts/3/0381-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="3 Watts 381" data-case-ids="1841284" data-case-paths="/watts/3/0381-01">3 Watts 381</a>; and he has suffered by nothing the garnishee has done. He has lost the advantage of a mere technicality, and lost it through his own neglect. We think the court below viewed the case correctly, and that there was no error either in receiving in evidence the attachment-execution, or in the charge relative to its effect, or in the answer to the plaintiff’s second and third points.</p>
    <p id="b223-6" data-blocks='[["BL_223.4",223,[262,2020,1165,246]]]'>Nor was there error in the answer to the fourth point.
