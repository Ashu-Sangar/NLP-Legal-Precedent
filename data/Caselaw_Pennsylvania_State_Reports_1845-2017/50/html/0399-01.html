Is the defendant subject to the penalty of the 10 per cent, for failing to report to the auditor-general the amount of its dividends, or an appraisement of the value of its capital stock during the year ? Such a report was necessary under the thirty-third section of the Act of 1844, and is now particularly enjoined by the first and second sections of the Act of the 21st of April 1858 (P. L. 419-20), which directs all corporations taxable under the laws of this Commonwealth, in the month of November of each year, to make such report. The second section of that act provides that, if any such corporation shall neglect or refuse to make such return or appraisement on or before the 31st day of December annually, there shall be added 10 per centum to the tax of .such corporation for each year. Was there such a neglect or refusal here as would subject this corporation to the penalty ? The evidence shows that the ofiicers of this canal company, during the month of November 1858, was in anxious correspondence with the auditor-general on the subject of its taxes, inquiring the rate thereof, how to be computed, from what time, &amp;c.; and, on the 7th of December 1858, that officer wrote, stating that the corporation was not taxable under the Act of 1844, and that there was no tax due from it at that time. The officers of this company had no reason to believe that it owed any tax to the state, after receiving such a notice from the fiscal officer of the government, until the passage of the Act of the 1st day of May 1861, clearly imposing the tax, and from that time forward it has been regularly paid. It is true that every one is bound to know the law, but the Act of 1858 imposes the penalty for ‘ a neglect or refusal’ to make the required report. Could the conduct of this corporation be considered either ? It had applied to the proper office and officer for information, and was informed that it owed nothing— did not come within the tax laws. To call this such a neglect or, refusal as would subject it to a penalty, would confound all our notions of right and wrong, and be at war with the whole system of jurisprudence in Pennsylvania. It never was the intention of <a id="p403" href="#p403" data-label="403" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*403</a>the legislature to impose a penalty in any such case. It is the spirit of the decision,' in The Easton Bank <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 10 Barr 442, that penalties will not be imposed where there are serious doubts as to the proper construction of an Act of Assembly, and no intentional violation of its provisions. Many other cases might be cited to the same effect. It can scarcely be said that <em>no doubts </em>existed here, for it is declared by the legislature, in the preamble to the Act of May 1st 1861, that doubts have arisen as to the liability of this and other similar companies to pay taxes, and provision is then made for their payment thereafter. You will, therefore, render a verdict in favour of the Commonwealth, for the amount of the tax, as settled at the accountant department, for the years 1858, 1859, and 1860, <em>minus </em>the penalty charged, and will compute interest on the sum thus found, after three months from the date of that settlement, and we will reserve the other questions raised and argued in this case, to wit: 1. Was this corporation subject to any tax prior to the Act of 1861 ? Is it absolved from all former taxation by the words of that act, or is the state barred by the several settlements annually made ? And, 2. Does the settlement bear interest, the amount having been reduced by throwing off the penalties ?”</p>

It is so considered and spoken of in ’ the Act of May 1st 1861, but I must confess myself unable to discover any. law giving such a power to the governor. It is certainly not embraced in the Act of 6th of April 1791, or its supplements, and is not authorized by the fifth section of the Act of April 21st 1858, for the sale of the public works. Possibly it may be conferred by some act which has escaped my observation. The company, after accepting and acting under such a charter of incorporation, may be estopped from denying its existence and validity; and if not utterly void, but only voidable, it cannot be inquired into in this case — may possibly come into question when the company asserts some right under it. We have not seen or read the charter, and have it not before us. The Delaware Division of the Pennsylvania Canal was transferred to the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company by virtue of the Act of April 21st 1858, clear of all encumbrance except the unpaid purchase-money, and would be subject to a tax in the hands of that company from thence forward. It probably was transferred to the present company soon after its incorporation, which should <a id="p404" href="#p404" data-label="404" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*404</a>have been reported to the auditor-general during the following November. At that time there was something over six months’ taxes due on .the dividend and capital stock in the hands of the two companies, and the established usage of the department in such cases is to charge for half a year’s tax. No valid or legal reason has been presented to excuse this corporation from paying a tax on its capital stock and dividends, under the Act of 1844, and prior laws, or on its capital stock under the Act of April 12th 1859. Those laws embrace all incorporated companies owning stock within the Commonwealth, unless where the same are expressly excepted by the statutes. Do the settlements which have been made, and receipts given, discharge this company from all taxes prior to that of 1861? We find that on the fifth day of December 1861, a regular account is stated, by the department, of the taxes due for that year, and the same was paid. This appears on its face to have been done under the Act of May 1st 1861. Payment has also been made of the tax due each year since. It must be conceded that in ordinary cases between individuals, a settlement or payment of subsequent years’ indebtedness will be presumed to discharge prior claims. But that presumption may readily be repelled by showing that the earlier one was not included. Conceding, for the present, that an erroneous settlement made of a certain year’s tax by the auditor-general and state treasurer, and payment thereof cannot afterwards be overhauled for mistake, yet that would certainly not debar the state from presenting a claim for a tax never settled by those officers, or paid by the debtor. We think it unimportant that the tax was due for a prior year ; the settlement is no bar. It plainly appears on its face that these years’ taxes were not included. It is a legal maxim that the government is not to be injured-either by the mistake or negligence of its officers, therefore the auditor-general, deciding that this corporation was not subject to taxation, and informing its officers that there was nothing due from it therefor, will not discharge the duty, but it must be paid when the mistake is discovered. In the case of the Easton Bank, already cited, the auditor-general informed the bank officers that it was chargeable with only a certain amount of taxes, which was paid; yet that was held to be no bar to a new settlement, and additional charge of taxes for the same year. In our opinion there is nothing in these settlements and payments which will absolve this corporation from paying the taxes now claimed.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b404-5" data-blocks='[["BL_404.4",404,[263,2197,1163,258]],["BL_405.1",405,[265,428,1175,2025]],["BL_406.1",406,[267,422,1165,171]]]'>“ Is the state debarred, by the Act of May 1st 1861, from claiming any tax from this corporation prior to its passage ? The preamble to the statute declares that it is passed to remove doubts which have arisen relative to the liability of those corporations to which the state canals were sold to pay taxes ; and the body of the act provides that they shall, ‘ hereafter,’ be subject to the <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>payment of a tax on their capital stock, and the second section renders them liable to the penalties imposed by the Act^of April 21st 1858 for a failure to make report and furnish an appraisement. As we conceive, no reasonable doubt could ever have existed as to all of these corporations being subject to the payment of taxes, and bound to make reports as others are required to do. There was no necessity whatever for the law, and there is nothing in its words which releases them from the responsibility fixed upon them by the former statutes. Laws cannot be repealed by implication, nor should a declaratory act be so construed as to relieve a party from a clear fixed liability. This Act of Assembly could not be plead by the corporation as a release from the payment of taxes imposed by former laws. A mistake in the auditor-general’s office, probably made by some clerk, first led to the supposition that no tax was imposed on the stock of any of these corporations, transferees of the public works, and the misapprehension which must, in law, be attributed to the officer, caused them to escape until the legislature acted on the subject. It would ■ have been better to have so worded the enactment as to have made them liable for the past, as well as the future, and required the arrears to be paid as well as the subsequent tax, but possibly the legislature did not take time to examine the matter, and took it for granted that there were serious doubts, and that they could not be compelled to pay if not previously liable, which would have been correct. As we view it, they were all liable from the date of their charter of incorporation, and this law did not relieve them. The charge of arrears of taxes for the years 1858-’9-’60 is therefore right, as settled by the department. Must interest be paid on these arrears after three months from the date of settlement ? The Act of 1811 provides that <em>‘ </em>all balances due the Commonwealth, on accounts settled agreeably to this act, shall bear interest from three months after date of settlement until paid.’ Had no erroneous items been taken into this account, and the ‘ balance’ struck by the accounting officers been sustained, there could have been no question on this subject. A portion of the charge has been rejected by our decision, and the defendant has, in part, sustained its appeal. The <em>balance </em>as struck was not due. The company could not lawfully know what amount to pay or tender, and therefore cannot be required to pay interest. The amount actually due is for the first time fixed on the trial, and interest can, therefore, only be allowed on the judgment. As already stated, in regard to the penalties, we do not consider that there was such default on the part of this corporation in failing to pay its taxes, after the decision of the auditor-general, and the&gt; action of the legislature, as will subject it to the payment of interest. There must consequently be deducted fror the verdict the sum of $&gt;470.96, allowed as arrears of interest, id the ver<a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>diet corrected according to the point reserved, and the amount for which it should have been rendered is now fixed at $9846, for which the clerk is directed to enter judgment, as of the 29th day of November 1864.”</p>

The ground of objection to the ruling of the iearned judge seems -to be: first, that by the Act of May 1st 1861 they were, in effect, declared unanswerable for any prior tax; and secondly, that the action of the accounting officers of the state, in omitting to charge them with taxes for the years mentioned, although they regularly settled their accounts for corporation taxes subsequently to the passage of the act, operated as a release.</p>

The doubts to be removed were, whether they, like “ corporations of a similar character, should pay like taxes.” <a id="p407" href="#p407" data-label="407" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*407</a>But while it is not, perhaps, absolutely necessary to this decision, to spend much time to prove them corporations, for they do not deny it, nor does the Commonwealth, yet it illustrates an idea necessary to a view to be taken of this legislation, to express an opinion on that point. By the Act of 21st April 1858, “ for the sale of the state canals,” it is amongst other things provided, that “ the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company shall have authority to grant, sell, and convey, or to lease for a term of years, the whole or any part of the said property to any corporation of this state, or to any association of individuals ; and their <em>grantees shall hold and enjoy the same, together tvith all the rights, </em>privileges, <em>and franchises granted by the act to the Sunbury and JSrie Railroad Company, ancl under such corporate name as said grantees may adopt,” </em>and these provisions are followed by others important to them as corporators.</p>

What matters it, that the terms of incorporation are less formal than usual ? The intention to create the association of individuals, who might purchase any of the public works, a corporation, is not only apparent in the act, but it is manifest that such an organization was absolutely necessary to the management and enjoyment of such a property. The terms of the act affecting the question have been quoted. They are that the purchasers, whether an association of individuals or a corporation, are to be invested with all the rights, privileges, and <em>franchises </em>of their grantors, the Sunbury and Erie Railroad Company; and in case of an association, they are authorized to choose or adopt a corporate name for themselves. Thus, by relation to-powers in existence in the grantors, the grantees were to be invested with the powers of and to become a corporation. It seems to be impossible to doubt of this. Yet doubt did exist in regard to this matter in the auditor-general’s office; for on December 7th 1859 that officer expressed the opinion to this company, that they were not taxable under the Act of 1844. To remove these doubts for the future was mainly the object of the Act of May 1st 1861. It does not, in any express terms, touch the question of past liability: does it by necessary implication ? I would answer, certainly not, unless there is a repeal by implication of the precedent statute, requiring the payment of these taxes. The rule is that an ancient statute will be impliedly repealed by a^ more modern one, only where the latter is couched in negative terms, or where the matter is so clearly repugnant that it necessarily implies a negative. Implied repeals are not favoured: Dwarris on Statutes 638, 673; Rex <em>v. </em>Barton, 12 A. &amp; E. 470. The Act of 1859 was not affected by any repugnancy between it and the Act of 1861. The latter act declared the former to be <a id="p408" href="#p408" data-label="408" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*408</a>the rule of taxation in the future, and said nothing about its operation in the past. That was left where the act found it. It was for the courts to say whether there were any doubts insoluble, as to the liability of these companies, prior to the passage of the act, and for taxes between their incorporation and its passage. The proper tribunal has had jurisdiction of that question, and has determined that they are liable for the taxes, and are not relieved from its payment by anything, express or implied, in the act; and we entirely approve of the conclusion not only for the reasons given there, but for the foregoing.</p>
    <p id="b408-3" data-blocks='[["BL_408.4",408,[274,860,1168,730]]]'>The second reason for non-liability of this company, viz. that the accounting officers thought so and omitted to charge the tax for the years mentioned, needs but little remark. The mistakes or misapprehensions of these officers could not prejudice the Commonwealth : Easton Bank <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 10 Barr 443. In many particulars and principles, this case resembles the one in hand. That was a case of pretermitted settlement of a claim against the bank. It arose in 1835, ’36, and ’37, and was settled in 1847. The omission of the accounting officers to settle was held to be no relinquishment of the claim, under a new statute, mistakenly supposed not to be in force for two years after it really was in force. The receipt of the tax under the former law for these two years, was held not to bar the Commonwealth from going back ten years and more, and settling anew the accounts of the omitted tax. That is a much stronger case than this, and rules it. We see no ground for complaint on part of the company, and affirm the rulings below against them accordingly.</p>
    <p id="b408-4" data-blocks='[["BL_408.5",408,[271,1590,1166,417]]]'>We must now turn attention to the'Commonwealth’s exceptions in this case. And the first involves the question of the right of the Commonwealth to claim, as against the company, ten per cent, for failing to make returns to the auditor-general on or before the 31st of December of each year, according to the Act of April 21st 1858. The learned judge in the court below was of opinion that the penalty should not be allowed under the circumstances of the case: in other words, that the company had not neglected or refused to furnish the required reports according to the terms of the statute.</p>
    <p id="b408-5" data-blocks='[["BL_408.6",408,[268,2018,1165,429]],["BL_409.1",409,[263,433,1166,259]]]'>There can be no question that this ten per cent, for failing to report is a penalty, and as such, not usually favoured in law. It is imposed in the act as a consequence of the neglect or refusal of the officers to make the requisite returns within the time specified. This undoubtedly implies a necessity of judging from the facts whether there was a refusal or negligence in making the return. There is no evidence of any <em>refusal </em>here, for there was no demand for a return. Was there any negligence in the case? The undisputed facts are, that the company were seeking for information from the department in order to make their returns in 1858, when <a id="p409" href="#p409" data-label="409" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*409</a>on the 7th of December of that year they were informed by the auditor-general that their company was not taxable under the Act of 1844. Thus the matter rested until after the passage of the Act of May 1st 1861, and after that they made their returns promptly enough, so far as we learn, and paid their taxes without being informed that they were in default for the yearll mentioned.</p>
    <p id="b409-6" data-blocks='[["BL_409.4",409,[263,691,1165,1294]]]'>It is difficult to deduce neglect from such circumstances; indeed impossible. Had the company sent their return, accompanied by the cash to pay their taxes, the auditor-general, as a conscientious man, would not have received it, holding the opinion he did, and yet a willingness to comply with the law which required reports would have been no more clearly deducible from this, than that which actually occurred. The Commonwealth is only entitled to the percentage as a result of the negligence or disobedience of the company: but to hold the company liable, not for their own default, but for the mistakes of the agentl* of the Commonwealth, is not to hold them so on the terms of the act, but in disregard of them. If they neither refused nor neglected'to make the required return, it is no matter in what way they may have been prevented; the forfeiture does not accrue. The argument that the mistakes of the officers of the state shall not prejudice her rights, is misapplied in this case. She had no right to the penalty, if the condition on which it was to be paid never occurred, and if her agents prevented the party from escaping a claim for it, it was not the party’s fault but her own. In an individual, such a process to produce a forfeiture would be disallowed, on the maxim that no one shall be permitted to take advantage of his own wrong. I entirely agree with the learned judge below, that it is repugnant to our sense of justice, even if there were some technical default on part of the company, in not' repeating their offer of reports under the circumstances, to insist on the penalty. Until they were notified by the auditor-general that they had been misled in relation to the required reports by himself, they might rely on his decision, without the imputation of having refused, or neglected their duty in the matter. We find no error in the ruling of the court on this point.</p>
    <p id="b409-7" data-blocks='[["BL_409.5",409,[259,1984,1166,474]],["BL_410.1",410,[268,416,1165,86]]]'>As to the question of interest on the account settled in the auditor-general’s office, we differ essentially from the learned judge below. We think it should have been allowed upon all that was found due and owing at the trial of the appeal, after three months from the date of the settlement completed in the auditor-general’s office. Why should the Commonwealth be subject to the loss of interest on her just dues, because she has failed to establish something that was erroneously included in the settlement ? Such a principle exists nowhere that I can discover. The Easton Bank <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 10 Barr 443, gives a very different rule The interest should have been allowed. We <a id="p410" href="#p410" data-label="410" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*410</a>must therefore reverse the judgment entered on the point reserved as to the interest, and enter judgment on the verdict.</p>
