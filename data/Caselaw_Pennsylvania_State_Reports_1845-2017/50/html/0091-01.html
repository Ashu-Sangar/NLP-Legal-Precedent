      <em>“ </em>The grounds upon which the case is rested are, that the defendants, by virtue of their charter, granted on the 13th of February 1822, were authorized to improve the navigation of the river Lehigh, from Wright’s creek to its mouth, by dams, locks, or any other device they might think most convenient; and that the Acts of Assembly under which they were incorporated imposed upon them the duty to complete their improvement on or before the 20th day of March, A. D. 1838, and ever after to keep every dam, lock, and sluice of their construction in good order and repair, and the said river freed from all obstacles and obstructions, so that boats, arks, &amp;c., might safely navigate the same. The improvement was completed within the time designated, and the navigation was maintained until the 4th day of June <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>1862, when a heavy freshet in the river destroyed the dams, locks, and improvements which had been constructed, and rendered the river wholly innavigable. The bill further shows that the defendants have since the freshet, and up to the time when the bill was filed, wholly neglected and refused to take any steps to put again in order or to repair the dams or locks on the upper grand section of their improvement from Mauch Chunk upward,, and that the public highway along the river remains impassable to the great and peculiar injury of the complainants.</p>

Wharton and others, who were the grantees of the defendants; that this adjoining tract of land was secured by them with a view of building a railroad for the transportation of their coal to the navigable improvement of the defendants ; that they constructed such a railroad, and have used the same for about twenty years ; that they have no other outlet for their coal to market, and that in consequence of the continued innavigability of the river Lehigh, and the condition of the defendants’ artificial improvement, their trade is interrupted, and their railroad and other improvements are rendered useless. The case comes before me on a general demurrer to the, bill, and six causes of demurrer have been assigned. I shall notice them briefly.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b95-6" data-blocks='[["BL_95.5",95,[218,1618,1166,861]],["BL_96.1",96,[279,448,1165,471]]]'>
      <em>“ </em>It is insisted the bill does not show that any contract or agreement was ever*made between the complainants and the defendants, by which the latter bound themselves to complete or keep in order that part of their canal which the complainants aver has been suffered to remain in ruins. The exception is true, and were this a bill for specific performance of a contract it would on that account be fatally defective, for there is nothing in it which shows any obligation resting on the defendants to make or to maintain artificial navigation upon the Lehigh river, above Mauch Chunk, growing out of any contract of theirs, either with the comjflainants or any persons whose rights the complainants have acquired. That the defendants were' bound to improve the navigability of the river above Mauch Chunk, and to maintain their improvements so that boats, arks, &amp;c., might safely navigate the,same, free from all obstacles and obstructions, is undoubtedly true, but their duty was one arising out of the act which incorporated them — a duty imposed by the legislature, the price of their franchise — not one voluntarily undertaken by any contract entered into with the complainants. I understand the bill, however, to seek not specific execution of a contract, but an injunction against a public <a id="p96" href="#p96" data-label="96" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*96</a>nuisance, from which the defendants have received a special injury. Consequent upon this is the prayer for an account and compensation. To sustain such a bill, it is not necessary that any contract have been made between the parties. If it was the duty of the defendants to make and to maintain the river navigable, to keep their locks, dams, canals, and pools in repair as a public highway, a duty which the Acts of Assembly clearly laid upon them, and if the complainants have suffered special and peculiar injury in consequence of their failure to perform this duty, for which injury there is no adequate remedy at law, there is sufficient ground shown for the interposition of a court of equity.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b96-6" data-blocks='[["BL_96.4",96,[279,919,1170,1550]],["BL_97.1",97,[227,425,1171,2024]],["BL_98.1",98,[284,419,1165,249]]]'>“ A second cause assigned for the demurrer is, that it does not appear in the bill the defendants have failed to use all reasonable diligence, ‘ since the destruction of their navigation,’ to reconstruct the same as a public highway for the use of the complainants and others, under the chartered rights of the defendants. I am of opinion, however, that want of proper diligence in making repairs is sufficiently averred. The canal and works of the defendants wefe destroyed by the freshet on the 4th day of June 1862, and this bill was not filed until seven months afterward. It charges that up to the time when it was presented, the defendants had neglected and refused to take any steps to place in good order and repair their dams and other works on the upper grand section, and it also charges that when applied to on the 11th of December 1862, for information whether they intended to restore the navigation, they returned an evasive answer. A third cause assigned for the demurrer is, that <em>‘ </em>the alleged damage, if any, done to or sustained by the complainants is consequential merely, and not direct, and gives them no claim on the defendants, such as they have preferred in their bill;’ with this I cannot concur. The allegations of the bill are, that the complainants have for many years been owners of coal-lands near and upon the upper grand section of the defendants’ works; that at large expense, after the completion of the locks, dams, &amp;c., and after the artificial highway had been completed, and opened for public use, they had constructed a railroad from their mines to the highway; that upon it they had erected the necessary works for the preparation and the shipment of coal; that they had transported their coal-over the canal from 1840 until its 'destruction in 1862, and that they have no other outlet for their coal to market. If the navigation be not restored, their railroad and their works upon the river are comparatively valueless, and their business as coal-shippers is destroyed. The injury they sustain, therefore, is a direct result of the nuisance permitted by the defendants, and as it is a continuing one, and is a peculiar and special injury to the complainants, it comes within the class of cases of which equity takes cognisance even at the suit of private individuals : Daniel’s Ohan. <a id="p97" href="#p97" data-label="97" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*97</a>Prac. 1858. It is a constant practice of courts of equity to enjoin against permitting artificial navigation to remain out of repair so as to interfere with its use at the suit of a private person whose business requires its use. A very considerable number of cases of this kind are to be found in the English books, as well as in those of this country, and I think this is a most fit exercise of authority by a chancellor, for it is obvious that the evil of permitting highways to fall into decay, though it may be punishable, is not entirely remediable at law. The other causes assigned for demurrer to this bill, in my opinion, have more substance; the Acts of Assembly under which the defendants were incorporated, and which are recited in the bill, provide a special remedy for neglect of duty to repair the works authorized and required to be constructed and maintained, and they point out a mode by which damages caused by neglect to repair may be ascertained and recovered. By virtue of an act entitled <em>1 </em>An Act to improve the navigation of the river Lehigh,’ passed the 20th day of March 1818, authority was given to Josiah White, George F. A. Hauto, and Erslrine Hazard, to improve the navigation of the river by dams, locks, or any other device which they might think most convenient, and to demand and receive tolls from boats and vessels making use of their improvement. The 9th section of the act provided that, if the grantees of the franchise should neglect or refuse to keep in good order or repair any dam, lock, or sluice of their own construction, or to remove any obstacle which might occur, so that boats, arks, rafts, or other vessels might safely navigate the river, any person might apply to the judges. of the Court of Common Pleas of the county where the default should occur. Whereupon a commission should be appointed to view and report thereon. The section further directed that in case an offence against the act (*. e., neglect to repair) was reported, the grantees might be indicted, and, on conviction, they should be liable to pay all damages resulting from their neglect of duty, to be recovered before a court of competent jurisdiction, and should also be liable to pay a fine. Thus a statutory mode of obtaining redress for private as well as public wrongs was provided. The rights of Josiah White, George F. A. Hauto, and Erslrine ITaz- and subsequently became vested in the defendants, and the legislature, by the Act of February 18th 1822, recognising the transfer, conferred upon them the privileges, and imposed the duties prescribed in the Act of 1818. By the 12th and 13th sections it was particularly enacted that the provisions of the 9th section of the Act of 1818 should remain unchanged, except so far as altered or supplied by the act itself. No change, however, was made in the prescribed mode of ascertaining a default, and recovering compensation for consequent injury. For any injury which the complainants have sustained there is then a remedy provided by <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>the Acts of Assembly under which the defendants exist, and to that remedy I think the complainants are confined. In such a case I understand the Act of March 2d 1806, as denying jurisdiction to this court over the complainants. Eor these reasons I shall sustain the demurrer, and dismiss the bill of the complainants with costs.</p>

The general laws of order so necessary to good government forbid anything like this.</p>

J., said, that “ the obstruction of a sidewalk not being more injurious to the relators in the mandamus, whereby it is sought to abate it, than to the inhabitants at large, the remedy to attain that end is by indictment exclusively.” The doctrine of this point was also fully discussed by the same learned judge in The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Burrell, 7 Barr 34. That was a <em>quo warranto </em>at the suggestion of a private party, and of this attempt he remarked: <em>“ </em>The Commonwealth has her own chosen officer for the protection of her own rights (and the rights of the whole community are what constitute public rights or the rights of the Commonwealth), and as she has not explicitly allowed his office to be assumed by any one who may please to try his hand at the business of prosecution, as his self-constituted <em>locum tenens, </em>we dare not assume the ¡sower to allow it.” I might largely multiply the citation of authorities to the same effect, but these will suffice to prove the principle, and I forbear. It is plain, therefore, that a private individual may not, in the absence of a special right, or special authority, vindicate the public for the breach of duties owing to her alone. Nobody will doubt but that he may enforce against public corporations contracts and duties which they ought to perform towards himself, and in doing this sometimes the public interests are subserved, and this is all right. But it is his special interest that gives him the right to act. This might be enough for this case, but it may not be out of place to add that we have no doubt but the remedy by a bill for an injunction, sued out on the part of the Commonwealth by her attorney-general, would lie against a company to compel them to observe their charter obligations. It would in this case be a substitute for a mandamus, and come within the power given to the courts in equity to control corporations other than municipal.</p>

If they could do that, damages incident to the non-repair, and proper to be allowed, might, on the principle that it arose out of the subject-matter of complaint, and equity jurisdiction having attached the whole subject in all its aspects, would be disposed of. But alone, as an independent ground of complaint and claim, equity would not entertain a bill; damages merely for all sorts of injuries are only properly cognisable at law. A decree or decision, there<a id="p101" href="#p101" data-label="101" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*101</a>fore, against the complainants’ right to maintain an injunction, is necessarily a denial of his equity to have damages on the accounts prayed.

We think the action of the court at Nisi Prius, on the demurrer, must be sustained, and accordingly the decree is affirmed, at the cost of the <em>appellants.</em>
