He was largely indebted in Philadelphia and elsewhere. Thomas L. Gillespie obtained a judgment against him in the Common Pleas of Franklin county, January 26th 1856. On the 10th day of March 1859, Alexander Dale and wife conveyed a house and lot of ground in Loudon to Mrs. Maddan. Thomas L. Gillespie procured an execution to be issued upon his judgment against A. B. Maddan, and the sheriff, levied upon and sold the house and lot of ground as his property. Gillespie became the purchaser, and on 1st of Hovember 1861 the sheriff acknowledged and delivered a deed to him for this property. The wife gave notice to the sheriff, at the sale, that the real estate belonged to her, and refused to deliver possession to.the purchaser. An ejectment was brought against the husband, and possession was defended under the wife’s title. During the pendency of this ejectment the husband died. The widow and two minor children, by their guardian <em>ad </em>litem,, were then substituted as defendants. The counsel obtained leave from the court to withdraw their appearance, and judgment by default was taken in open court. Subsequently to the entry of this judgment, on the 23d January 1863, she conveyed the real estate to her two minor children, the consideration for the deed being natural love and affection. The children by their guardian then brought then the present ejectment against the sheriff’s vendee.</p>

It has been gravely doubted whether they are not already too numerous. Such as are founded on what is called legal policy are of peculiarly doubtful propriety. Their effect is to cover up the truth, without leaving any compensation in additional securities given against either fraud or perjury. If truth be the object sought, it is difficult, in most cases, to perceive why a jury may not be trusted with the testimony of a witness, and why they are not competent to make all fit allowances for any peculiar position in which the witness stands. The probable influence upon his testimony arising from any contingent interest, moral or pecuniary, he may have, is as apparent to a jury as it can be to a court, and it certainly ought not to be assumed that even a prejudiced witness can be of ho assistance in ascertaining the truth.</p>
    <p id="b264-15" data-blocks='[["BL_264.16",264,[293,2243,1161,215]],["BL_265.1",265,[277,456,1167,692]]]'>The objection urged against the admission of Mrs. Maddan to testify in behalf of the plaintiff in this case, rests entirely upon some supposed - policy of the law. She was not disqualified by interest, for it is well .settled that .a grantor of land, without covenant or warranty of title, is competent to testify in support of the <a id="p265" href="#p265" data-label="265" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*265</a>title of his grantee. Nor ordinarily does any known legal policy prohibit it. It is no reason for exclusion, that the title of the grantee was derived from the witness. If then there be any policy which would justify the exclusion of Mrs. Maddan, it must grow out ■ of tb,e nature of the title set up against the plaintiffs below. But surely it cannot matter for what' reason the title of the grantees of the witness was assailed. Had the husband and the wife conveyed in his lifetime to the plaintiffs, both would undeniably have been competent witnesses for their grantees, and each might have defeated the claim of the creditors of the husband by giving testimony against it. Where the wife has conveyed after the husband’s death, there is no rule of policy, of which we have knowledge, that makes her any more incompetent than she would have been had her husband in his lifetime joined her in her deed, and we are not inclined to introduce a new rule of exclusion. The first assignment of error is therefore not sustained.</p>
    <p id="b265-6" data-blocks='[["BL_265.4",265,[279,1147,1166,519]]]'>The second assignment is also groundless. The plaintiffs do not claim through Hr. Maddan or under him. His declarations, therefore, made in their absence, and not in the presence of any one under whom they claim, can amount to nothing. True, Mrs. Maddan was the grantor of the plaintiffs, and she was the wife of Hr. Maddan. But neither a wife’s declarations are evidence to affect title of her husband, nor are a husband’s declarations admissible to destroy a title of his wife. In Murphy <em>v. </em>Hubert, 4 Harris 56, and in Jones <em>v. </em>McKee, 3 Barr 496, this was ruled of declarations of a wife, and in Smith <em>v. </em>Scudder, 11 S. &amp; R. 325, it was held that admissions or declarations of a husband were not evidence against his wife, or to affect her interests after his death.</p>
    <p id="b265-7" data-blocks='[["BL_265.5",265,[279,1666,1167,518]]]'>The third assignment is also not sustained. It complains of the rejection of the husband’s declarations made some two years before the deed for the house and lot in dispute, was made to Mrs. Maddan. The only possible pretext for the admission of such evidence against the grantees of the wife is in the assumption that husband and wife confederated to defraud his creditors by covering up his property from their reach. Of this we see no evidence, but if there were such evidence it would not make the husband’s declarations, made long before the combination and not in pursuance of it, evidence against her. It is only acts and declarations of a conspirator in furtherance of the common design, or during the prosecution of it, that can affect his confederates.</p>
