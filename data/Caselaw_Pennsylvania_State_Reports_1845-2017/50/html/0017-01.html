We asserted, as the bond asserted, that he had made our money as commanded by our writ, whence it followed that he should have paid us the money — that we were legally entitled to have it from him; and yet the court say that this undoubted legal liability to pay us the money was no defence to the claim for indemnity for not thus paying it. Surely in this there was error. The negative answer admits our right to demand and receive the very money now in controversy, and yet holds that we are bound to repay it. In effect, we could legally require the sheriff to pay us this $578.91, and yet he can legally require us to pay it back to him. We conceive the adjudications amply demonstrate the error of the answer. See McLelland <em>v. </em>Slingluff, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 134" data-case-ids="481821" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0134-01">7 W. &amp; S. 134</a> ; Watmough <em>v. </em>Francis, 7 Barr 206. We'showed, and such is the hypothesis of the point, that Sheriff Cope had really levied and sokl under our writ, and we argued he was liable to pay us the money. The fact that he had Collmar’s writ first is no answer, since he chose to disregard that fact and execute our writ first. Under the decisions just cited his liability to us became clearly established; and he showed his sense of this liability by paying us the money thus made on our writ.</p>

For, 1st, it was raised and put in issue by the pleadings, and the parties were thus placed fin the very position they would have occupied if the action had been for a false return brought by Noble <em>v. </em>Cope. The truth of Cope’s return to Noble’s writ was the very identical issue which the jury were sworn to try. And, 2d, even if this were not so, the sheriff’s return to Noble’s writ was not conclusive, because it was set up by himself in his <a id="p22" href="#p22" data-label="22" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*22</a>own action. The rule that a sheriff’s return is conclusive is limited to controversies between third parties, and does not hold where the return is set up by the sheriff, either in support or defence of an action in which he is himself a party: Sheerer <em>v. </em>Lautzerheizer, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20551" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="6 Watts 551">6 Watts 551</a>.</p>

The view of our defence taken by the learned President of the Common Pleas, we respectfully submit, was an entire misconception of our case. The court looked upon it as a contest between two execution-creditors for the proceeds of sale after they were paid into court, each claiming priority of right. That Mr. Noble participated in the contest, preferring then the same claim he now makes; that the Court of Common P,leas heard and adjudicated his claim, deciding against him; and therefore, his claim having been already disposed of, cannot be set up here. This is all a mistake. There was no contest between Noble and Colimar upon a question of priority of right for the proceeds of sale in court. A petition is alleged by the record entries to have been filed, asserting that Collmar’s judgment was fraudulent and praying for an issue to try that fact, and an issue was awarded, but it was never tried. There was no adjudication upon the question. If there had been such an adjudication it would not have determined any question of priority of right, as among the execution-creditors. This latter question could not have arisen, for the court and all the execution-creditors were bound, as to all such questions, by the return which Sheriff Cope, saw fit to make to Collmar’s writ. There was no discretion left. The court was bound to award the money to Colimar.</p>

There is a record entry declaring him to be such a party, but such an entry cannot suffice to prove such a fact. The very utmost it could prove would be that a petition was presented purporting to be signed by him. Proof of the direct fact of signature must have been made in the ordinary way, to charge him with the consequences of such signature. He denies the signing of such'a-petition. No one ever saw such a petition. No kind of proof of contents 'was offered, not even the existence of the paper was shown; so that np proper ground for proof of contents was laid, and no such search as the law requires was made for the petition.

He had a right, knowing at that time that- Sheriff Cope had entirely <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>changed his ground in reference to his writ, to take his chance of success on another and totally different question. If he could defeat Oollmar’s judgment because it was fraudulent, he could get part or all of his money out of the fund in court in that mode, and thus avoid the necessity of a lawsuit with Cope on the question of the falsity of his return. There is no sound reason why he could not buy his peace in that manner, without prejudicing his right to avail himself of his defence against the bond, when his defence was founded not upon the invalidity of Oollmar’s judgment, but upon the falsity of Cope’s return. The latter defence grows exclusively out of Sheriff Cope’s own act, while with the former question he had nothing whatever to do ; and yet we were denied the benefit of a controversy upon the one, because the court below thought it was identical with the other. Noble might be liable to the sheriff on the bond in suit, if his own judgment could be successfully impeached by the other creditors, and therefore he would have a distinct personal interest in contesting Colimar’s judgment as fraudulent, as he would thereby take from him his character of creditor and deprive him of the opportunity to contest his own judgment. If we are correct, the error of the court in denying our first and second points was manifest.</p>

Pie had the power to sell undér our writ without any regard to other writs, and no man but himself could know, conclusively, whether he had done so or not.

It is said that Cope <em>“ </em>alone knew whether he had made Noble’s money.’’ If by this it is meant that Cope knew anything more about either the facts or the law, we deny the assertion. He knew the facts and so did Noble ; he refused to take the responsibility of deciding the law, and Noble acquiesced in the refusal by giving the bond, which otherwise had no meaning. It is said that the bond contains a solemn averment that the money was made on Abie’s and Noble’s writs exclusively, and not at all upon Collmar’s. That also we deny. To make the bond intelligible it was necessary to make some statement as to the circumstances, otherwise the transaction would have been a mere private loan of money from Cope to Noble. The description of the money was necessary for the purpose of identification. It would have been perhaps more correct to say money made by the sale of Klusmeyer’s goods under several Avrits, &amp;e., Afithout naming anybody ; or Avrits of Able-, Noble, and others.

    <p id="b30-6" data-blocks='[["BL_30.5",30,[273,1104,1167,341]]]'>The writs of Colimar and Noble having both issued the same day, the question of priority was to be decided by the time at which they came to the sheriff’s hands. Collmar’s writ was left with the jailer at the sheriff’s office, in his absence on the morning, and Noble’s writ was placed in the sheriff’s hands on the evening of the 10th July. Whether that entitled Collmar’s writ to preference was one of the questions that must have been passed upon in the decree of distribution of March 24th 1857.</p>
    <p id="b30-7" data-blocks='[["BL_30.6",30,[273,1445,1168,432]]]'>Then it was alleged, in behalf of Noble’s writ, that the levy was made upon that, and not upon Collmar’s, so that if Collmar’s writ was indeed prior, Noble was entitled to the money, because it was raised upon his writ — an allegation which brought the sheriff’s return of both writs and several disputed facts into litigation, and which were or might have been decided in the matter of distribution. In his charge to the jury in the present case, the learned judge said, in respect of the decree of distribution, that “ <em>the court decided that Noble’s execution was not entitled to any part of the proceeds of the sale.”</em>
    </p>
    <p id="b30-8" data-blocks='[["BL_30.7",30,[272,1876,1166,557]]]'>Such was undoubtedly the effect of that decree, and it was neither excepted to nor appealed from, but was acquiesced in by Noble, and all other creditors of Klusmeyer. It concluded, of course, every issue that could have been properly litigated therein. With the exception of a question of estoppel, raised upon the bond in suit by the defendant’s 4th point, every question discussed here ought to have been, and we are bound to presume was, discussed and decided then and there. Surely we are not expected to reverse that decree in this collateral action. Nor can it be considered as brought up by this writ, of error. Standing unreversed and unappealed from, it is conclusive as a decree of distribution, and establishes, by a final judgment of the law, that Colimar was entitled to the whole proceeds of the sheriff’s sale.</p>

      <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>But before the sheriff returned the writs in his hands, he let Noble have part of the money — that is, he paid Noble’s judgment out of the proceeds, and.for his own indemnity took from Noble and Sitgreaves the bond in suit, dated July 20th 1855, which recites, among other things, that the moneys in his hands were made out of the goods of Klusmeyer, under and by virtue of writs of <em>fieri facias, </em>“ <em>at the suit of the said IP. W. Noble and one David Abler </em>This is alleged to estop the sheriff from enforcing the bond of indemnity, and this question, I agree, was not affected by the decree of distribution.</p>
    <p id="b31-6" data-blocks='[["BL_31.4",31,[237,848,1171,218]]]'>Although the recitation is that of Noble and Sitgreaves, and not of Sheriff Cope, yet as he accepted the bond, and his personal representatives now claim under it, he is affected by all it contains as much as if he were the author instead of the acceptor of the instrument. But what is the extent of the estoppel ?</p>
    <p id="b31-7" data-blocks='[["BL_31.5",31,[237,1064,1170,260]]]'>Sheriff Cope having several executions of different creditors in his hands against Klusmeyer, sold his goods and raised a sum of money which he had a right to distribute to creditors, but at his peril. He had a right also to retain the money in his hands until the return day of the writs, and then bring it into court for distribution by the court.</p>
    <p id="b31-8" data-blocks='[["BL_31.6",31,[236,1324,1170,560]]]'>In these circumstances he allows Noble to take the amount of his execution upon giving the bond of indemnity, which recites, as before stated, a sale by virtue of the writs of Noble and Able. But it does not assert that the sale was on those writs alone. It is a fair construction of the recitation that the sale was made on the writs of Noble and Able, in connection with the other writs i^, his hands. Where a sheriff levies and sells goods by virtue of several writs of <em>fi. fa., </em>that which first came to hand will be entitled to priority, but if the levy and sale be exclusively on a writ which came to hand subsequent to another, the subsequent writ will take the money: McLellands <em>v. </em>Slingluff, <a href="/watts-serg/7/0134-01" class="citation" data-index="27" data-cite="7 Watts &amp; Serg. 134" data-case-ids="481821" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/7/0134-01">7 W. &amp; S. 134</a>; Watmough <em>v. </em>Francis, 7 Barr 206 ; Shafner <em>v. </em>Gilmore, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0438-01" class="citation" data-index="28" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 438" data-case-ids="1854644" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0438-01">3 W. &amp; S. 438</a> ; Wilson’s Appeal, 1 Harris 426.</p>
    <p id="b31-9" data-blocks='[["BL_31.7",31,[235,1884,1169,467]]]'>The sheriff’s return of the writs showed that he levied and sold by virtue of Colimar’s writ as well as by virtue of those of Noble and Able, and the decree of distribution established the priority of Collmar’s writ. Now, we see no necessary inconsistency between these facts and the recitation in the bond. Estoppel excludes truths which are inconsistent with itself, but not such as agree with it. Whether the fact be so or not, we are bound to presume as against the sheriff, that he levied and sold by virtue of the writs of Noble and Able, but we are not forbidden to believe, from other evidence, that he levied and sold also by virtue of Collmar’s writ.</p>
    <p id="b31-10" data-blocks='[["BL_31.8",31,[237,2359,1167,84]],["BL_32.1",32,[286,392,1180,859]]]'>Then, upon this state of facts, the ultimate and final conclusion of law was that Colimar was entitled to the money, but on the <a id="p32" href="#p32" data-label="32" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*32</a>20th. July 1855 the sheriff did not so understand it, or he would have paid no money to Noble. And yet he did not recognise Noble’s absolute right, else he would not have taken the bond of indemnity. The bond must be so construed as to stand in place of the money during the interval of doubt and litigation. If effect were given to the recitation according to the argument, the bond would be nullified, and had as well not have been given. Without the bond Noble would not have got the money, for the sheriff was not bound to pay it to him till the court had passed upon his right, and the express purpose of the^ond was to “ <em>indemnify the said Jacob Cope, sheriff as aforesaid, from all suits, actions, claims, demands, accounts, and damages whatsoever, for or by reason of the payment of said sum of money.'” </em>The bond stood instead of the money, and meant-that if the money should be finally adjudicated to some other creditor, Noble would return it to the sheriff. On the 24th of March'1857, it was adjudicated to Colimar, and was paid by the sheriff, whereby his right of resort 'to the bond became complete. To give the extravagant effect to the recitation of the bond which is claimed for it would defeat a transaction that was plain and fair on its face.</p>
    <p id="b32-6" data-blocks='[["BL_32.4",32,[298,1251,1167,294]]]'>Another question was argued that was not raised in the court below, that the bond was void on account of illegality of consideration. This is an ungracious defence for a party to set up who got the use of money that should have remained in the sheriff’s hands. If 'it were fairly upon the record, it would not be worthy of support, but as it was not made in the court below we will not consider it.</p>
    <p id="b32-7" data-blocks='[["BL_32.5",32,[298,1554,1166,87]]]'>We see nothing in the errors assigned to justify a reversal, and therefore the judgment is *</p>
