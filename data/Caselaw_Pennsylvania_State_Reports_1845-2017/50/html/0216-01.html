He made his will, bearing date the 8th day of May, A. d. 1845, which was duly admitted to probate by the register of Eranklin county on the 13th day of the same month. The testator left surviving him a widow named Sarah, who is the defendant in the above action. By his will he made the following provision for her:—</p>

The plaintiffs recovered a judgment against the widow to No. 72, August Term, a. d. 1858, of the Court of Common Pleas of Eranklin county, for $240. On the 18th of April 1862 they caused an attachment-execution to be issued on said judgment to No. 22 of August Term, a. d. 1862, to levy and attach the dower coming to the widow from the land bought <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>by George Johnston. The writ was served by the sheriff of Franklin county, on the 22d day of April, A. D. 1862, and George Johnston summoned as a garnishee. The money which became due to the widow for her dower, on the 10th day of May, A. d. 1862, had been paid in full to her by George Johnston, the garnishee, prior to the issuing and service of the attachment-execution. The interest on the dower, to wit, $198, which commenced to accrue on the 10th day of May, A. D. 1862, and which became due and payable to the widow on the 10th day of May, A. D. 1863, was paid over to her by the garnishee, after it became due, and after the service of the attachment-execution upon him. Sarah Mahon, the widow, has other property besides this dower, worth $300. The will of Robert Mahon and the deed from David Mahon and wife to George Johnston, are made part of this case stated. If upon this statement of facts the court should be of opinion that the interest upon the dower, becoming due on the 10th day of May, A. D. 1868, was bound by the attachment-execution in the hands of the garnishee, and that upon the case stated the plaintiffs are entitled to recover, then judgment to be entered for said plaintiffs for $175.08 and costs; otherwise judgment to be entered for the defendant for costs.</p>
