Less than an hour before the mortal stab was given to McMarity, the prisoner declared he would kill somebody before twenty-four hours ; he hallooed it all around the deck, says a witness. Now it was of material consequence that the Commonwealth, who sought to convict the prisoner of .murder in the first degree, should give evidence of a premeditated purpose, a formed design to kill or to do some great bodily harm; for without malice prepense there could be no conviction of the higher grade of murder.</p>

If the jury believed that the prisoner had formed the deliberate design to kill somebody, and in pursuance of that purpose, within an hour after declaring it, did kill McMarity, the Commonwealth had a right to insist upon his conviction of murder in the first degree, and that they might thus insist, they had a right to prove his declaration an hour before the deed. Blackstone ranks “antecedent menaces” and “former grudges” as evidences, of malice prepense; and he tells us, moreover, that malice prepense is not so properly spite or malevolence to the deceased* in particular as any evil design in general, the dictate of a wicked, depraved, and malignant heart.

The record in this case was made up in substantial conformity to the general practice.
