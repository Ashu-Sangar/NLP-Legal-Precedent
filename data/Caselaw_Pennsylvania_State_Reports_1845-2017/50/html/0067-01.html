Persch was the owner of fifty shares of stock in the defendants’ association, on which he paid dues to the 15th day of May 1861, at which time the shares were worth about $22 per share. After that time, the dues upon his stock were paid by what was called relief loans, the association taking bonds from Persch, and giving orders on their treasurer, which orders were credited against the dues. No money whatever was paid by Persch after the 15th day of May 1861. The dues on the stock were paid by giving credit to Persch upon the books in this manner, commencing on the 19th day of June 1861, and ending on the 1st day of September 1863. The dates at which the credits were given him, by way of relief loans, were July 10th 1861; Pebruary 1862; June 3d 1862; January 21st 1863 ; and September 1st 1863. He gave powers of attorney to the association (without producing the certificates of stock) to transfer forty-three shares of the stock as security for these relief loans, and such other loans as might be made to him. At the time the powers of attorney were given-, Persch promised to deliver the certificates to the association. The power of attorney given to the secretary of the association to transfer nineteen shares of stock, was dated Pebruary 18th 1862.

It was proved that about two and a half years before the time of trial, the defendant in error had submitted to counsel for his opinion of their sufficiency, a power of attorney from Persch for the transfer of certain shares of the stock of the association, plaintiffs, and the certificates thereof. The power of attorney and certificates produced at the trial could not be identified, nor was it necessary that they should be ; for in the absence of any evidence that the defendant in error ever held any other power of attorney Or certificates, the conclusion was legal and logical that the power of attorney and certificates produced at the trial were the very same which had been submittéd to counsel about two and a half years before.</p>

The only question in such cases is whether the blanks have been so filled up as to carry out the intention of the constituent. In Denny <em>v. </em>Lyon, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Wright%20101" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Wright 101">2 Wright 101</a>, it is admitted that blank powers of attorney for the transfer of stock are customary.

The evidence shows that the secretary of the association, had notice of the assignment before the demand for transfer was made — how long before could not be proved. It is submitted there was no necessity for any notice beyond the knowledge which the plaintiffs possessed that Persch did not produce the certificates. The knowledge of this fact was sufficient; they could not be benefited by any other notice or injured by the want of it, as, under their constitution and by-laws, no use could be made of stock without producing the certificates. Their treasurer testified that it was customary to require the certificates. If they were satisfied with Persch’s promise, they have their action over against him. If their officers failed in their duty, they can be made responsible on their official bonds. Had they insisted on the production of the certificates, either they or the defendant would have obtained Other security, which Persch was then abundantly able to give. They had the means of protection in their own hands, and if they failed to use them, they should not ask that the defendant should suffer loss through the default of their own officers.</p>

The general rule that the assignee of a chose in action takes subject to the equities between the original parties, before notice of the assignment, can have no application in this case.

The defendant held the certifidate of stock duly assigned by the lawful owner thereof, and the plaintiff’s books showed that all dues had been fully and regularly paid, and that for all money borrowed and all credit given the required security had been executed and delivered to them.
