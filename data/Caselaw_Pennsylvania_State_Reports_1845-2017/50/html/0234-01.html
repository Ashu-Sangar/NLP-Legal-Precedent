This principle was taken by the auditor and the court below as only applicable to the case where the interest of third parties, purchaser or creditors, intervened. The Supreme Court have viewed it, however, as a question of intention, and declared that taking a conveyance as tenants in common is evidence that the partners did not intend to bring the property into partnership stock, but that they intended and did take separate interests: Erwin’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wright%20535" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="3 Wright 535">3 Wright 535</a>. In this case the parties took a deed, in the <em>habendum </em>of which the conveyance was to them as tenants in common. They never afterwards manifested any purpose of converting it into partnership property by any deed or writing, and they therefore stand toward each other as they would to third parties under our decisions as tenants in common, and each be entitled to one-fourth of the proceeds of the sale of the land.</p>

Ho such necessity is shown here. The old firm has no debts except a secured mortgage. Appellees have not shown that they are creditors of the firm, except by their own allegation, and if they had any equities to work out through the partnership property, why did they not do so long ago ? Their delay in so doing argues doubts whether such equities, if any existed, would be advantageous to them. If appellant is their debtor, it would have been profitable to them to have had a settlement long ago. At the dissolution of the firm, the appellees formed a partnership, continuing the business, taking possession of all property of the old firm, including material, which for five years they have worked, during the most prosperous time iron manufacturers have ever known. During this time there has <a id="p237" href="#p237" data-label="237" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*237</a>been no settlement of the affairs of the old firm, nor is there any evidence that appellees made any attempt.</p>

The purchase-money of this real estate may be considered as divided profits, and if appellees can follow and claim them in this case as partnership property, they can follow and claim any other profits for the same which appellant may have received. The principle contained in the decisions of this court upon this subject, regards as divided profits, investments made by a firm in real estate to themselves, as tenants in common.</p>

The partners, as individuals, never had anything to do with it, the purchase having been made by the manager or agent of the firm, and the payments having all been made by their book-keeper. In some cases the courts regard the question, whether or not real estate is partnership property, as mainly one of intention: Hoxie <em>v. </em>Carr, 1 Sumner 181. The object of the purchase, the subsequent use of the property, and the manner of payment, show very clearly that it was a partnership transaction.</p>

Yet there is no doubt that, by the agreement of the partners, it may be brought into the stock, and considered as personal property, so far as concerns themselves and their heirs and personal representatives. It was so decreed by Lord Eldon, in Ripley <em>v. </em>Waterworth, 7 Ves. Jr. 424. But if a conveyance of land is taken to partners as tenants in common, without mention of any agreement to consider it as stock, and afterwards a stranger purchases from one of the partners, it would be unjust if without notice, he should be affected by any private agreement.”</p>

So, in Kramer <em>v. </em>Arthurs, 7 Barr 165, Chief Justice Gibson held that a joint stock company to deal in land is essentially a partnership, and land purchased by it as an article of trade is not subject to judgment and execution at the suit of a separate creditor. So in Overholt’s Appeal, <a href="/nc/47/0222-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Jones 222" data-case-ids="8682199" data-case-paths="/nc/47/0222-01">2 Jones 222</a>, Judge Rogers held that where land has been purchased for partnership purposes and was so held, judgments for partnership debts are payable out of the proceeds in preference to judgments against partners individually.</p>

It is true he says, p. 537, “ Had the title been taken to both Imhoff 'and Myers, without any assertion on its face that it was treated by them as partnership property, under the ruling in Hale <em>v. </em>Henrie, <a href="/watts/2/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="2 Watts 143" data-case-ids="1840152" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0143-01">2 Watts 143</a>, and several subsequent cases, <a id="p239" href="#p239" data-label="239" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*239</a>they would have been but tenants in common. The absence of such an assertion would have been evidential that the partners did not intend to bring the property into partnership stock, but that they intended to take separate interests. But the legal title was conveyed to Jacob Myers alone. We are now looking for the use.” But the cases of Hale <em>v. </em>Henrie, Ridgway, Budd &amp; Co.’s Appeal, 3 Harris 181, and the language of Coulter, J., in Lancaster Bank <em>v. </em>Myley, 1 Hands 549, all relate to purchasers and creditors, and not to the partners themselves, considered simply as members of the firm. Our recording act affects purchasers and creditors, but does not, independent of them, disturb the actual relations of the partners to each other in respect to partnership property, whether real or personal.</p>
