      <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>The court below (Linn, P. J.), on hearing the cause, delivered the following opinion, June 1st 1863 :—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b87-6" data-blocks='[["BL_87.4",87,[233,513,1167,776]]]'>“ The defendants are admitted by the case stated to have acted as agents of Langdon &amp; Diven, and to have been furnished with money or means to pay for the work done as it progressed. As a general rule, an agent becomes personally liable only when the principal is not known, or when there is no responsible principal, or when the agent becomes liable by an undertaking in his own name, or when he exceeds his power. In this case the agency of the defendants was known to all parties, but the allegation is, that defendants undertook in their own name and upon their own responsibility to pay the amount which should be coming to plaintiffs, according to their agreement with Goss. As we view the facts stated, we see nothing more in them than that Goss ordered, or gave authority to the defendants, as agents of Langdon &amp; Diven, to pay the plaintiffs out of the sum agreed to- be paid to Goss, $2 per thousand feet less what Goss had already paid them; and the defendants, acting as agents of one of the original contracting parties,' agreed to recognise this sub-contract, and pay to plaintiffs accordingly.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b87-7" data-blocks='[["BL_87.5",87,[233,1289,1166,302]]]'>“ In all this ive can see nothing which would render the defendants personally bound, if Langdon &amp; Diven failed to pay. But it seems that Langdon &amp; Diven did not fail to pay, but actually furnished the defendants with the means of payment; and the facts as admitted show that defendants had in their possession that which had been furnished to them by their principal to meet this very balance due to plaintiffs. •</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b87-8" data-blocks='[["BL_87.6",87,[230,1591,1175,730]]]'>“ In this view of the ease the defendants are clearly bound to pay over, according to their agreement, to the plaintiffs the moneys received by them from their principals- for that purpose. As known agents, and acting as such, the defendants would not be bound for the performance of the original contract, nor for the payment to Goss or to the defendants (his sub-contractors), in case of their inability or failure to pay. This is, however, a very different thing from an agreement by them to pay the defendants $2 per thousand out of moneys actually furnished- to them by their principals to meet this very undertaking. The means, or moneys being-proved, or admitted to be in the hands of the agefits, and direction by the principal not to pay over, clearly the defendants are bound' by their engagement, and the balance may be recovered from, them either upon footing of an express or implied undertaking. Perhaps in the absence of an express agreement to pay to plaint-tiffs, the action upon the implied promise could only be brought-by Goss ; but of this it is unnecessary to inquire.</p>

Certainly only as agents ; and the fair construction of the case stated, is that they are described as such with the right to disburse the money when received. There is no admission of their receipt of this money; and the only language that could be construed into such an admission, expressly refers to the Goás log job, and says not a word about Kepharts’ job.

The contract of Whitcomb &amp; Sons was not merely an agreement by them as agents of Langdon &amp; Diven, but was a personal contract on their part with the Kepharts to pay them for their work, except what Gross paid them, and in consideration of this agreement or contract with Whitcomb &amp; Sons, Kepharts were to go on, and afterwards did go on, and put in the logs and do the work for which this suit was brought. This contract can admit of only two constructions ; the one construction is that they (Whitcomb &amp; Sons) were to pay the Kepharts; and this would render Whitcomb &amp; Sons liable at all events. This is the true construction of the contract. For the object of Whitcombs was not to pay Kepharts the money furnished by Langdon &amp; Diven, but to pay them chiefly out of their own store at a profit to themselves, and then retain the money furnished by Langdon &amp; Diven; and this seems to be what the contract says. The other construction is that Whitcombs were to pay Kepharts out of the money received by them from Langdon &amp; Diven. And in this latter case Whitcomb &amp; Sons would be liable only when they were furnished by Langdon &amp; Diven with the means of paying. The court below adopted the latter view, being the one most favourable to the plaintiff in error. The case stated admits that Whitcomb &amp; Sons were furnished with money or means to pay for the work done as it progressed.</p>
    <p id="b89-7" data-blocks='[["BL_89.7",89,[224,1718,1171,346]]]'>2. The objection that Whitcombs’ attorney could not bind his clients in the case is not sustained by argument or authority. It is surely as regular and as clearly within the power of an attorney to agree to a case stated for his client as it is to write out his ■ declaration, enter his plea, or admit evidence in the course of a trial. In all such cases it is presumed that the client has informed his attorney of the matters pertaining to the case. The very fact of employing him as attorney gives him this authority.</p>

      <em>meat. These </em>powers are confessedly his. But the only question for us is whether, on the case as stated, the court érred in giving judgment for the plaintiffs. The important facts as agreed upon are, that one Goss had a contract with Langdon &amp; Diven to cut saw-logs for them on their land for a stipulated price per thousand feet. Afterwards Goss gave a sub-contract to the plaintiffs below, by which they undertook to cut a part of these logs. Whitcomb <em>&amp; </em>Sons, the defendants, were agents of Langdon &amp; Diven, and were furnished with money or means to pay for the work done as it progressed. The sub-contractors meeting with some real or supposed difficulty in obtaining payment from the defendants, a new arrangement was made between the three parties, Goss, the plaintiffs and the defendants, by which it was agreed that the plaintiffs should go on with their work, that the defendants should pay them according to the rate fixed in their sub-contract, except so far as Goss himself might pay them, and reserve the amount paid by them out of the sum coming to Goss under his contract with Langdon &amp; Diven. The plaintiffs then went on with the work, and there is an unpaid balance due them of $288.10, with interest from March 15th 1861. On this state of facts judgment for the plaintiffs was inevitable. The new contract was made by them with the defendants personally, and not with them as agents of Langdon &amp; Diven. Nothing in the case shows that the plaintiffs undertook to work for Langdon &amp; Diven, but they prosecuted their work in fulfilment of their new engagement with Whitcomb &amp; Sons. It is noticeable that the contract of the defendants was not to pay out of money furnished by their principal. They were to be reimbursed with that money, but they did not limit their obligation to pay by any mention of the fund to be used for such a purpose. And if they had thus limited it, the case stated finds they had funds in hand to pay as the work progressed furnished to them by Langdon &amp; Diven. It is said this means money furnished for the Goss job. Admit it. The work of the plaintiffs was a part of the Goss job.</p>
