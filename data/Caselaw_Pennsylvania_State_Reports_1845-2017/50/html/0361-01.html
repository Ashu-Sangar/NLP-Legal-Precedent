This seemed to have been acquiesced in, the owners and occupants of the Arnold lot still using the right of way to the pump on the Wendell lot, by passing, not due north and then west, but by going north-west and in between the front and back buildings on the Wendell lot to the pump on the north side of said lot. The right of way and use of the water was thus enjoyed till 1855, when Mr. Arnold extended his building east so as to include the gate, which was built up and formed part of the wall of his house, shut up the old gate, and opened a new one, the near' side of which was fifteen feet two inches from the north-east corner of the old Foster house. At the time the new gate was made and the old one nailed up, Mrs. Gallaher owned the Wendell lot, but made no objection to opening the new gate at the time, and Arnold continued to use the new gate and get water from the well as long as Mr. Gallaher lived there. No new contract, however, was made. He moved from the property in 1838. Mr. Woods then occupied it as his tenant for two years, and in 1860 G-allaher and wife sold to Cornman, the present defendant.

We may remark, however, that there is nothing in the verdict and judgment which negatives the existence of a right of way over the lot of the defendant. It is a mistake, therefore, to assert that the plaintiff has lost his right, whatever that may be, without evidence against it. Some right was conceded by the court, but whether it was along the precise line claimed by the plaintiff was all that was necessarily involved in this suit. We have not the declaration before us, but it appears to be conceded that it does not complain of any disturbance of the right reserved in the deed from Thomas Foster to Michael Wendel in 1798. That way was closed in 1838, by the erection of a permanent building across it; and the most that the plaintiff now claims is a right to a substituted way over another part of the defendant’s lot. It is vain to insist that this is identical with the one expressly reserved in Foster’s deed. If the plaintiff has any right to this way over the line where the obstructions complained of are erected, it is by virtue of an agreement of substitution, or by virtue of continuous user for a sufficient time to warrant the presumption of a grant. We see no direct evidence of an agreement of substitution, and no evidence at all of it, except such as is inferrable from the user of the way by the plaintiff. It is manifest, therefore, in both aspects, whether the plaintiff’s right to a passage-way over the route which he alleges has been obstructed, depends upon an agreement to substitute that route for the one described in Foster’s deed, or whether it depends upon continued and adverse user alone, the nature of the user is all-important. If it was rambling, sometimes along one line and sometimes along another, it was inadequate evidence either of an agreement of substitution or of an original grant. By such usage no such right could either be evidenced or acquired. Hence there was no error in instructing the jury that “ the plaintiff must show how and what way he passed over to the well. By a loose and rambling way of passing over the lot, sometimes in one way and then in another, he could not acquire a right.” This language was used by the court in reference to the acquisition of a right of way different from that reserved in the Foster deed, and that deed is material in this case only as aiding the presumption that a new and different way was granted.</p>

But we think there was evidence of such conduct on the part of the plaintiff as would make it inequitable for him now to insist upon an unobstructed passage-way along the line where he alleges his right is. The defendant became the purchaser of the servient lot in 1860. <a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>At that time the gate which opened from the plaintiff’s lot, the entrance to the way reserved in Poster’s deed, had been closed hy a permanent wall, and the way itself was obstructed by a building. Finding matters in that condition, the defendant commenced the erection of a new building across the line of what the plaintiff now insists is his substituted way. Of this the plaintiff was cognisant. He saw the building in process of erection, without complaint, or any assertion of rights that could be interfered with.
