      <em>“ </em>We, the jurors impannelled in this case, find the following facts: On the 27th February 1861, Thomas P. Cochran obtained a judgment on a judgment-note, in the Court of Common Pleas of Perry county, against Samuel Chathams, the defendant, for $953.84, on which a <em>fi. fa. </em>issued, and a levy was made on defendant’s personal property, except that exempt from execution, which was sold by the sheriff on the 6th March 1861 for $573.73, and purchased by Thomas P. Cochran, the plaintiff in the execution. The property thus purchased is the same enumerated in the indictment. Before the sale commenced Mr. Cochran told defendant that he would purchase the property, if it did not go above what he considered its value, and loan it to him to have the use of it for a time, until he (Cochran) saw proper to take it again. Mr. Cochran purchased the property and left it in defendant’s possession. Both parties then lived in Perry county. About the 1st of April following (1861), defendant, with the knowledge of Mr. Cochran, removed to a farm in Juniata county, and took the property with him and used the property in farming. In the following December, January, or February, Mr. Cochran went to defendant’s to look after the property. He saw the greater portion of the property ; some of the cattle were in the field which he did not see. Defendant told Mr. Cochran he was going to another farm, and did remove to Dr. Crawford’s farm in the same county about the 1st April 1862. In the fall of 1863 Mr. Cochran sent an agent to look after the property. The agent returned and told Mr. <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>Cochran he did not think all the properly was there. On the 1st December 1863, Mr. Cochran issued a writ of replevin for the property, and an agent went with the sheriff of Juniata to execute the replevin. Defendant denied that he had any property of Mr. Cochran’s, and the sheriff could find none. 'The defendant sold a mare and some cattle, and killed for his own use three hogs, of the property purchased by Mr. Cochran. The mare was sold in March 1862. There was none of the property in his possession which could be ftiund by the sheriff when the replevin issued, and the defendant denied that he had any of Mr. Cochran’s property. The defendant on several occasions after he removed to Juniata county claimed all the property in his possession as his own.</p>

And so it would be, were not the sense in which it is used limited and defined in the latter clause of this section, by the words, <em>‘ </em>although he shall not break bulk, or otherwise determine the bailment.’ This clearly points to the species of bailment intended to be embraced in the 108th section by the codifiers of the penal laws, and that this section was only intended to apply to carriers. This species of bailment is enumerated by Chancellor Kent under the fourth subdivision of <em>loeatio, </em>or hiring for a reward, and of which he says: ‘ it is by far the most important, extensive, and useful of all the various contracts that belong to the head of bailment.’ This construction is strengthened by the remarks of <a id="p184" href="#p184" data-label="184" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*184</a>the commissioners who framed the penal code, who say: ‘This section is new, and framed to meet a strange anomaly in the common law. If a carrier is intrusted with the transportation of a package of goods, and appropriates the whole to his own use, he is not criminally liable, but if he opens the package and withdraws a portion of its contents, he is guilty of larceny. * * The section proposed will, if adopted, place the law and common sense in harmony with each other on this subject.’ This shows that the section was only intended to apply to carriers, and subject them to criminal liability, whether they stole the whole or only a part of the goods intrusted to their care. The words, <em>‘ </em>although he shall not break bulk,’ is only applicable to this kind of bailment. But if we give them the extensive meaning, contended for by the learned counsel of the Commonwealth, and apply them to any and every bailee within the general meaning of that term, it would lead to strange results. The 114th section provides for the punishment. of bankers, brokers, attorneys, merchants, or agents appropriating to their own use the property of others intrusted to them for safe custody. The 116th section provides for the punishment of officers, directors, or members of any bank, or other body corporate or public company, who shall apply to their own use the money or other property of any other person deposited therein.</p>

If the 108th section is general and applies to all kinds of bailment, then bankers, brokers, bank officers, or officers of any body corporate or public company, may be indicted for larceny under the 108th section, or for a misdemeanor under the subsequent sections, at the option of the district attorney.

This may well be admitted. We have heard no apology or excuse for the ingratitude with which he treated Mr. Cochran, who, doubtless, prompted by the kindliest and most benevolent feelings of the human heart, provided defendant with the means of supporting himself and family. The defendant has repaid the kindness of Mr. Cochran as the adder repaid the kind husbandman who warmed it into life. But there are many great immoralites fwhich are not the subjects of criminal <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>punishment, and however we may reprohate the conduct of defendant, we cannot sentence him for conduct not recognised as criminal either at common law or by our penal code.</p>

A pawnee is a bailee within the general meaning of the term.

While the broker or banker who committed the more aggravated crime, of applying his neighbour’s money, deposited for safe keeping, to his own use, could be convicted, under the 114th section, of a misdemeanor only.

The indictment is framed upon the 4th section of the 20 &amp; 21 Vict. c. 54, which applies to bailees ; and it is only necessary to say the word bailment must be interpreted according to its ordinary legal acceptation. Understood in that sense, a bailment relates to something in the hands of the bailee, which is to be returned in specie, and does not apply to the case of money in the hands of a party who is not under an obligation to return it in precisely the identical coins which he originally received.”</p>

Cases) 206, it was held that the prisoner, who was a trustee, treasurer, and secretary of a savings bank, was rightly convicted under the same act, of fraudulently appropriating money received from the depositors, he being a trustee upon an- express trust created by an instrument in writing, since the set of rules of the savings bank was an instrument of writing within the meaning of the act, and the eighth rule contained an express trust to invest the moneys for the benefit of the institution, <em>i. e., </em>the depositors.</p>

Cases) 22, it was held that an innkeeper’s wife, breaking open a box containing money intrusted to her husband’s care and fraudulently taking-the money, might be convicted as a bailee. Martin, B., saying: “ I do not think it necessary that there should be a contract of bailment to make a person liable as a bailee. In my opinion the prisoner comes within the statute as a bailee by license.” Pollock, C. B.,: “I am disposed to be of the same opinion.” The rest of the judges concurred. In Mr. Greaves’s note, p. 73, to his edition of the Criminal Law Consolidation and Amendment Acts, in speaking of this clause and of the decision in Regina <em>v. </em>Hassall, he says: “ The object of this clause was simply to make those eases larceny where the general property in the thing delivered was never intended to be parted with at all, but only the <em>possession ; </em>where, in fact, the owner delivered the property to another, under such circumstances as to deprive himself of the <em>possession </em>for some time, whether certain or uncertain, and whether longer or shorter, at the expiration or determination of which time the owner was to have restored to him the very same thing that had been so delivered. In order, therefore, to bring a case within this clause, in addition to the fraudulent disposal of the property, it must be proved: first, that there was such a delivery of the property as to divest the owner of the <em>possession, </em>and vest it in the prisoner for some time ; secondly, that at the expiration or determination of that time the identical same <a id="p189" href="#p189" data-label="189" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*189</a>property was to be restored to the owner. Proof of all these facts will be all that is necessary under this clause. The discussion in Regina <em>v. </em>Hassall was clearly right, and will apply to the present clause.”</p>
    <p id="b189-6" data-blocks='[["BL_189.4",189,[235,620,1160,550]]]'>The construction of this section therefore seems to be settled by the highest judicial authority in England, and we see no reason why we should not adopt it as a fair and reasonable interpretation of the words bailee and bailment, and which properly punishes an individual who is really more guilty than the starving woman who steals a loaf of bread. The language of the judge as to the prisoner’s base conduct is very emphatic: “We have heard no apology or excuse for the ingratitude with which he treated Mr. Cochran, who, doubtless prompted by the kindliest and most benevolent feelings of the human heart, provided the defendant with the means of supporting himself and family. The defendant has repaid the kindness of Mr. Cochran as the adder repaid the kind husbandman who warmed it into life.”</p>
