R. vol. 83), in the Exchequer Chamber, the limitation of responsibility of the shareholders of the assurance company was on the face of the policy, and there was an express agreement between the assurers and the assured that the capital stock and funds of the company should alone be liable to answer and make good all claims under the policy. Here therefore was an express and positive agreement to limit, and that is really the extent of the decision. Baron Martin says, “ It seems clearly established by <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>the authorities that, with respect to those persons who have no notice of the terms of the partnership, the stockholders and partners in joint stock companies are liable to the same extent and in the same manner as the partners in ordinary partnerships, and that the law pays no regard to the stipulations in the partnership deed as to the restriction of the liability, or to any particular provisions as to the mode of carrying on the business different from that ordinarily used in such concerns.</p>

R. 627, it is not distinctly so stated by the’Lord Chancellor, Cranworth, but it seems to have been the inclination of his opinion that if third parties, knowing the stipulation for limited liability, enter into contracts with the directors, they cannot set up unlimited liability against the body of shareholders. In Re The Sea, Fire, and Life Assurance Co., 18 Jurist 118, 387, 23 Eng. L. &amp; Eq. R. 422, the same Lord Chancellor said: “ Supposing, in order to test the point, that there had been a clause in the deed stating that the parties thereby stipulated that in no contingency, and under no circumstances whatever, whether the affairs prospered or failed, should any one of the shareholders become liable for more than ¿61 per share. What would be the effect of such a stipulation ? His honour’s judgment proceeded upon the assumption that the effect of such a clause would be that no creditor could ever come upon any shareholder <em>ultra </em>the ¿61 per share. That was a very strong assumption, because it militated against the doctrine of partnership as hitherto understood in this country. Whether the principle was right or wrong was a question then under investigation before the legislature ; but that it was the law at that time could not, for one moment, be disputed— that every person engaged in a partnership was liable for everything. If three persons agree to carry on a business together, notwithstanding they stipulate among themselves that no one should be liable beyond ¿61000, if a debt were contracted in the conduct of the business to the extent of ¿610,000, every one of <a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>them would be liable for the ¿610,000 and the stipulation so made would be inoperative.</p>
    <p id="b486-5" data-blocks='[["BL_486.4",486,[270,548,1167,774]]]'>“ That doctrine did not defend upon the persons dealing with them having or not having notice of such stipulation, for the creditors would only know what engagements the partners had made amongst themselves, and their rights were rights extrinsic of any such contract, and therefore notice would be wholly immaterial. If the deed of partnership were hung up in a shop and it contained a provision ‘ Notice is hereby given that it is agreed that none shall be liable for more than *100,’ it would make no difference. How could a person tell whether they would be liable or not ? He might trust them to the amount of ¿650, but they might already have incurred debt with other persons to the extent of ¿6100, and therefore how would it be possible for him to ascertain the extent of their liability ? Whether there ought to be such a limited liability was not the question. The court had only to enunciate what was then the law, and that was, that such a notice would be of no avail. That was the law in common partnerships, and although joint stock partnerships might differ from them in some respects, they agreed with them in the main.</p>

It seems to have been thought that such a stipulation can in nowise operate as a limitation of the general liability of all the partners for all their debts, even though the creditors have full notice thereof. It may, however, be still deemed an open question, whether creditors, with <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>such notice, can proceed against the members upon their general responsibility as partners, where they have expressly contracted only to look to the social funds ; and whether, if they have notice of the qualifying stipulation, and contract with reference to it, it may not be easy to assign a reason why it does not amount to an implied agreement to be bound by it as much as if it were expressly agreed to. But a qualified agreement of this character must be proved, and is never presumed without some reasonable proof thereof.”</p>
