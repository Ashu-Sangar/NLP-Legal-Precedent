Supposing the question to be open to the defend<a id="p546" href="#p546" data-label="546" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*546</a>ant to defeat the city, by showing there was no employment of Emannel Peters to do the work, the court were in error in rejecting the offer to prove by McCarthy, chief commissioner of highways, that he employed him to do this paving, and also in refusing to allow the subsequent questions by the plaintiff to be put to the witness. We think also that the plaintiff should have been allowed to prove: 1st. That Dr. Burgin waived his right to a notice required by the ordinance ; and 2d. That he had stated to the workman who was going on with the work that it was all right, to go ahead.</p>
