It is a maxim of the law, ‘ that penal statutes must be construed strictly,’ and no one can doubt but that the present act comes within that category. Yet, while the courts concede the truth of the general maxim, they must take care to carry into effect the actual intention of the legislature, and not, by a forced construction or verbal nicety, exonerate those who come within the plain meaning of the law.

The 1st section of the act requires a return to be made of the business done, and set forth the amount thereof, and pay three per centum of a tax thereon into the state treasury. The 3d section requires a report of the names composing the firm, or of the individuals engaged in the business. It must be conceded that these sections command the performance of distinct duties. The 3d section imposes the penalty in these words: Any stockbroker, &amp;c., ‘who shall neglect or refuse to make the return and report required by the 1st and 2d sections of this act, shall, for every such neglect or refusal, <a id="p204" href="#p204" data-label="204" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*204</a>be subject to a penalty of $1000, which penalty shall be collected on an account settled by the accountant officers, as taxes on bank dividends are now settled and collected, and shall not be relieved from paying the amount which he is liable to pay to the Commonwealth, under the provisions of the 1st section of this act, on account of having been compelled to pay the said penalty.’ The word <em>‘ </em>return’ is best applicable to the duties required by the 1st, and ‘ report’ to those commanded by the 2d section; yet, when the law comes to impose the penalty, it speaks of ‘ a penalty of $1000’ for every neglect or refusal to perform the duties required by the 1st and 2d sections; and again it says, <em>‘ </em>which penalty’ shall be collected on an account settled, &amp;c. In the latter part of the section, the <em>‘ </em>said penalty’ is again used in the singular number, but that gives us but little light, as it refers to the duty to be performed under the 1st section alone. On the whole, I am of the opinion that we cannot, in accordance with the rules prescribed for construing penal statutes, impose more than one penalty of $1000 for a breach of this law. Penal statutes must be taken literally in defining and setting down the crime and the punishment, says Dwarns, p. 634, edition of 1848; and from that to page 642, he gives us references to the various cases decided from time to time. We cannot, therefore, without a departure from the rules prescribed for construing penal statutes, bring a penalty within what might be considered the equity of the law, which does not come within the letter. If the legislature wishes to prescribe a double penalty, it should do it by plain and explicit language, not leave it to be made out by construction and intendment. It is very true, a double duty is directed, but a single penalty is imposed for its breach. It has been argued that if the defendants should merely report the names of the firm, refusing to render any account of their business, or pay the tax imposed, by our construction they would escape the penalty. Such is not our opinion. On the contrary, a violation of the duty prescribed by either section subjects the party to the penalty. It is like the rule laid down by a higher law, that he who breaks it in the least is guilty in the greatest, and he who offends in any one particular is guilty in all. Had the duty of making payment been thrown into another section, and it had been referred to in connection with the penalty, as are the duties prescribed by the 1st and 2d, the party would be subject to the penalty, although he had reported the names of the firm, and stated a full account of the business, yet failed to make payment; and a neglect or refusal to do all, would subject him to no greater penalty. If the one prescribed is inadequate, it is for the legislature to increase it, or impose an additional punishment, in explicit terms. The court cannot make the law, nor extend it by construction.</p>

No damages can be given for its detention, and interest is given by way of damages: 1 Boll. Abt. 574; 4 Burrows 2018, ’22. Our own Supreme Court has so decided in several cases, the last of which is Bank of Chambersburg <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 2 Grant’s Cases 384. That case was first brought into this court on appeal, and we held, on full consideration, that interest could not be recovered, but ultimately dismissed the proceeding, on the ground that the penalty imposed could not be collected by a settlement at the department.</p>

We have now an opportunity of re-examining the subject with more care on this special verdict. The ground for the claim of interest is, that the Act of 1861 provides that <em>‘ </em>the penalty shall be collected on an account settled by the accountant officers, as taxes on bank dividends are now settled and collected,’ and the 35th section of the Act of March 30th 1811, relating to <em>‘ </em>Public Accounts,’ declares c all balances due the Commonwealth on accounts settled agreeably to this act, shall bear interest from three months after the date of settlement until paid.’ It cannot be doubted but that the balance found due the state, on the settlement of bank dividends, will bear interest after three months, but that is not conclusive of the present case.</p>

There are ample matters on which these words may operate, without introducing so great an innovation on the common law as to give interest on a penalty before judgment rendered. It is to be settled by the same officers, subject to like decision by the governor, in case of disagreement; the same notice to be given in order to render it conclusive, and like time for taking an appeal, with similar form of exceptions to be filed, and the money to be collected by a suit in this court if no appeal is taken. It may possibly come within the letter of the law, but not within the spirit and intention. The Act of 1811 speaks of <em>‘ </em>balances’ found due the Commonwealth on the settlement, which clearly imports an account in which there may be partial payments, or claims on both <a id="p206" href="#p206" data-label="206" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*206</a>sides, and a balance struck, which can scarcely <em>be </em>predicated of a proceeding to collect a penalty, even on a settlement by the accountant officers. It has often been declared that the best construction of a statute is to construe it as near to the rule and reason of the common law as may be, and by the course which that observes in other cases: 6 Wilson; Bacon’s Abr. 388, title <em>Statutes. </em>In all doubtful matters, and where the expression is in general terms, statutes are to receive such a construction as may be agreeable to the rules of the common law in cases of that nature. In all general matters the law presumes the act did not intend to make any alteration : Id. 384. Acts of Parliament, in what they are silent, aré1 best expounded according to the use and reason of the common law: 1 Stra. 45 ; 11 Mod. 150. A thing within the letter of a statute is not within the statute unless it be within the intention of the makers: Bacon’s Abr. 385, with numerous examples given. Our own Supreme Court has frequently recognised this rule of expounding statutes, as near to the provisions of the common law as their words would bear. Although the Act of 1861 is a great innovation of the common law, in providing that a penalty shall be collected from a citizen or firm by means of a settlement at the department, yet we do not feel ourselves authorized to say that still greater or other innovations shall follow as an incident, and that the penalty, when thus stated, shall bear interest after three months, especially when by taking an appeal the sum never became a judgment until trial in court. We cannot believe that such was the intention of the legislature, or is the fair meaning of the Act of Assembly.</p>

An appeal having been taken to the Court of Common Pleas of Dauphin county, that court held that but one penalty could be recovered for <em>both </em>neglects, and also that no charge for interest could be made.

But this strictness, which has run into an aphorism, means no more than that it is to be interpreted according to its language. <em>Literal </em>interpretation is but a figurative expression, meaning, perhaps, that we are to adhere so closely to the language we are not to change the signification by dropping even a letter. The purpose of the rule is to prevent acts from being brought within the scope of punishment, because courts may suppose they fall within the spirit of the law, though not within its terms. To create offences by mere construction is not only to entrap the unwary, but to endanger the rights of the citizens. But in the case before us it is wholly unnecessary to run away from the language of the act.

It is to be observed it is the language of reference, and we are therefore, by the words themselves, sent to inquire for the delinquencies referred to. But the moment we start off on this errand, we discover that the reference is to a return, to be found only in the first section, and to a report, provided for only in the second, and that they differ widely. Each is indispensable — the report, that it may be known to the Commonwealth who is liable to taxation; the return, that the means of assessing the tax may be furnished. The report is once for all time the party may continue in business; the returns annually until he ceases. It is clear that the offences being different in kind, independent in act, and distinct in time, each is liable to punishment. When the legislature therefore said, every such neglect or refusal should be the subject of a penalty, it becomes very plain it did not refer to a <em>joint </em>neglect of <em>several </em>acts impossible of simultaneous performance. Had the word “ every” been omitted, the language might have been dubious, but with it before us, as a part of the very <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>letter of the act, we are admonished by the reference to resort to separate sections to ascertain the neglect or refusal referred to, and thus compelled to give the distributive word <em>every </em>a reference to each: <em>reddendum singula singulis.</em>

    <p id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.4",208,[258,593,1163,1154]]]'>We think that under the 35th section of the Act of 30th March 1811, interest should have been allowed, beginning to run from the end of three months from the time of the settlement. It is pot denied-that a'penalty generally bears no interest before judgment. But a judgment which ascertains the liability bears interest. So here the legislature has said the balance of a settled account shall bear interest after three months from the date of settlement. The settlement ascertains the debt which the party owes to the Commonwealth. The balance is the sum found due. , When the legislature provided that this penalty should be collected on an account settled by the accountant officers, as taxes on bank dividends are now settled and collected, it fixed the mode of procedure governed by the Act of 1811. There is no reason, therefore, to exempt this ease from the provisions in the 35th section as to interest. By the settlement the penalty becomes a debt, and the balance in the settlement bears interest as' other debts thus ascertained. Now, unless the appeal of the debtor opens this settlement to the prejudice of the Commonwealth, clearly the time of the commencement of the interest- being fixed by the law on the actual debt of the debtor, there is no just principle which can relieve him. The legislature has determined the right of the Commonwealth to have interest on all such settled demands. Then can it be tolerated, that when a debtor makes an unfounded appeal, and is at last condemned to pay all that was settled against him, he can make a virtue of his own wrongful delay to escape payment of what he justly owes as interest? We think not, and that he should pay interest as well as debt.</p>
