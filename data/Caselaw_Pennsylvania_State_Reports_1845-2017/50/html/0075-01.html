It was a gift by a man wholly insolvent. Here is a man who has taken a sum of money which he possessed, and has bought with it a policy on his life. This is a piece of property. Suppose it were a policy of insurance against fire. Suppose Mr. Elliott, as a creditor, had insured the life of a debtor, and assigned this to his wife. There is nothing in the nature of the property which- enables an insolvent debtor to give it away. It may be argued, that this is a species of property that a creditor could not touch. What foundation is there for such an allegation ? A life policy passes to assignees in bankruptcy (Schendess <em>v. </em>Wall, 1 Camp. 487), and their title will cut out a subsequent assignment. And notice to insurers is necessary to prevent such a title from vesting in assignees: Williams <em>v. </em>Thrope, Sim. Ch. Rep. 257 ; West <em>v. </em>Reid, 2 Hare 249; Ex parte Price, 13 L. J. Rep. Bank. N. S. 15 ; In re Styan, 1 Philips’ Ch. 105. What is to forbid a creditor from laying an attachment in the hands of the insurer, and obtaining the avails of it when the debtor dies ? But if there were technical difficulties in the way of an attachment, equity would interfere in the creditor’s favour, as in case of a legacy, prior to our act allowing it to be attached.</p>

There is no evidence that the fact of such transfer was communicated to any one. It was in proof that the trustee did not know of the transfer. There is no pretence that value was paid — but the transaction was purely voluntary. Under these circumstances, the authorities all maintain this ruling. The distinction is between a declaration of trust and a. gift, or transfer: Ex parte Pye, 18 Ves. 149. A gift, if complete, passes the property. If the subject be a chattel, delivery is <a id="p80" href="#p80" data-label="80" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*80</a>essential; without it, all declarations are ' but evidence of an intent unexecuted. If it be stock or a chose in action, and is assignable at law, there must be a complete transfer, so as to pass the title. If not assignable at lawy-&gt;there must be such a perfected transfer as would pass the right at law if assignable. Where the transfer is by way of assignment — there being no binding contract — there must be delivery of the evidences, or of the instrument of transfer. Want of delivery of an instrument purporting to be an assignment, is as fatal in equity, as at law. Retention of the instrument, if once complete by delivery, is immaterial; but the <em>factum </em>of delivery is as essential to its existence as an assignment as to a deed. Nor can an incomplete assignment operate as a declaration of trust. It is only where assignments cannot operate at law that equity enforces them upon the maxim <em>ut res magis valeat, </em>as a declaration of trust, because the equitable or beneficial right had thereby passed: Mark <em>v. </em>Kettlewell, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Phil.%20347" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="1 Phil. 347">1 Phil. 347</a>. Neither can it operate as a declaration of trust, because it is not binding as a contract at law or in equity. See Earle <em>v. </em>Law, 15 Sim. 95 ; Antrobus <em>v. </em>Smith, 12 Ves. 39. Nor can it operate as a declaration of a trust any more than would any other instrument intended to evidence a gift, but incapable of passing the property. See Fletcher <em>v. </em>Fletcher, 4 Hare 80 ; Uniacko <em>v. </em>Giles, 2 Molloy 257 ; Edwards <em>v. </em>Jones, 1 M. &amp; Cr. 226 ; Fortescue <em>v. </em>Barnet, 3 M. &amp; K. 36. Had the executor of Mr. Elliott been a stranger and taken possession of the policy, Mrs. Elliott and her trustee must have asked the aid of the court, when she would have been met by the want of delivery, and hence the imperfectness of her title.</p>

But “ the contract commonly called life assurance, when properly considered, is a mere contract to pay a certain sum of money on the death of a person, in consideration of the due payment of a certain annuity for his life;. the amount of the annuity being calculated in the first instance, according to the probable duration of the life ; and when once fixed it is constant and invariable. .The stipulated amount of annuity is to be uniformly paid, on one side, and the sum to be paid in the event of death is always (except where bonuses have been given by prosperous offices) the same on the <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>other. This species of insurance in no way resembles a contract of indemnity.” This is the measured language of Baron Parke, now Lord Wensleydale, a very learned judge, in delivering the unanimous opinion of the Court of Exchequer Chamber, in Dalby <em>v. </em>The India and London Life Assurance Company, on the 2d December 1854, reversing and overruling the decision in Godsall <em>v. </em>Boldero, 15 Com. Bench 365 (80 E. C. L. R). In this case, which is now the settled law of England, it was held that independent of the Act of 14 Geo. 3, c. 48, as to assurances of lives, all contracts for wager policies, and wagers which were not contrary to the policy of the law, were legal contracts at common law ; and that under that statute, if there was an interest at the inception of the policy, it was not necessary that it should exist when it became payable.</p>
    <p id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[215,1051,1165,950]]]'>Life assurance, as by a Gallicism it is called in England, commenced there upwards of a century and a half ago, and in 1859 there were one hundred and fifty-nine companies, comprising proprietary companies based upon a paid-up or promised capital, for which interest is paid upon shares; mutual societies founded upon the asserted sufficiency of the premium fund, and mixed companies proceeding upon a combination of both principles. As a broad principle large companies can afford to be generous, and the Equitable boasts that it has never “ but in two instances disputed a claim out of its numerous and vast engagements,” and that is remarkable for a society that has paid away in all forms twenty-nine millions sterling, or one hundred and forty-five millions of dollars. Policies in good offices after five or seven years’ standing are always saleable, and a considerable number are sold by auction every year. “We noticed,” says the Edinburgh Review, of January 1859, “the advertisement of sale of a sale in Dublin of twenty-seven policies of assurance in various offices. It is worthy of remark that they generally find purchasers at fair values when effected in the first class offices. The offices themselves will state the value of their own policies for a fee ; and the common practice is to obtain the office value, and that of an independent actuary, before the sale.”</p>

In the case before us the dececent effected four policies on his life, in four distinct companies, each in $10,000. One of these was not assigned, and its proceeds have passed into the accounts of the <em>executors; </em>all the other policies, three in number, which were effected on the 12th February and 2d and 3d March 1859, were on the 10th September in the same year, by assignments on the respective policies, assigned to “ J. Thomas Elliott in trust for the only use and benefit of my wife Eliza T. Elliott, her heirs and assigns,” and to two of the compa<a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>nies notice of the assignments whs given in due form by Mr. Elliott, the decedent, agreeably to their rules, but no notice was given to the International Life Assurance Society of London, that company not requiring such notice of the assignment; the three documents remained together in his fire-proof, and were there found after his death in November 1859. The auditor charged the executors with the International policy, but refused to surcharge them with the other two policies, which report was confirmed by the Orphans’ Court, from which the executors have appealed as to the surcharge of the one policy, and Mr. Clay has appealed from the other part, declining to surcharge them with the other two policies. I am ^inclined to think under the decision of the Lords Justices, reversing the Master of the Rolls, In re Ways’ Trusts, 34 L. J. C. 49, 10 Jurist N. S. 1166, that all these assignments stand on the same footing, notice of the assignment to the trustee or to the company in the case of the International being unnecessary. These assignments were all voluntary, and would have been good against heirs, devisees, or legatees, but here the decedent died insolvent, and the question is, are they good against creditors. These policies were securities for money,, valuable dioses in action which could be sold at public and private sale, and are included in the general words personal estate or property, and would pass under that head by deed or will. The words used in the statute of 13 Eliz. c. 5, are goods and chattels, which is the generic denomination of things personal as distinguished from things real, or lands, tenements, and hereditaments, and therefore includes life insurance policies, although unknown at the time of the passage of the statute, and it is clear that the voluntary assignments in the present case did disturb, hinder, delay, and defraud the creditors of the decedent. In England, in the later cases, it has been held that unless the property conveyed can be reached by execution, the conveyance is not fraudulent, because it does not delay or hinder creditors ; a very narrow and inequitable rule, and contrary to the earlier cases as held by Chancellor Kent, (1 Story’s Com. 368).</p>

N. S. 901, life policies are regarded as securities for money, and a voluntary conveyance of them was held fraudulent as against creditors under stat. 13 Eliz. c. 5. But in Norcutt <em>v. </em>Dodd, 1 Craig &amp; Phillips 100, it was held in. a case unaffected by the statute of 1 &amp; 2 Vict. c. 110, that a voluntary alienation of the property by a party who, at the time of such alienation, was insolvent, may be set aside in a suit by his assignees subsequently appointed under the Insolvent Debtors’ Act, although the subject <a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>of such alienation be a cbose in action. Lord Chancellor Cottenham said: “ This being an assignment of a chose in action, and the debtor being still living, the transaction is not fraudulent under the statute of Elizabeth alone,"but under that contract taken in connection with the Insolvent Debtors’ Act, I am of opinion that it is. The difficulty which arose upon the statute of Elizabeth with respect to voluntary assignments of choses in action was, that during the lifetime of the .debtor, creditors could not be said to be prejudiced by them, inasmuch as that species of property was not subject to be taken in execution; but after his death it was otherwise, because then the creditors might reach all his personal property, of whatever kind; and the same reason applies when the debtor has brought himself within the operation of the Insolvent Debtors’ Acts, because under those acts all his property becomes applicable to the payment of his debts.” This is also the case in bankruptcy, so that assignees in bankruptcy and in insolvency, and executors or administrators of an insolvent, may as representing creditors set aside any fraudulent conveyance, of any property of the bankrupt or insolvent, whether it be liable to execution in his lifetime or not. In Pennsylvania, under the mixed jurisdiction of our courts, it is settled that the executor or administrator of an insolvent estate may set aside a fraudulent conveyance, as he is in such a case a trustee for creditors.</p>
