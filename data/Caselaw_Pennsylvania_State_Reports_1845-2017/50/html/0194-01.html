Smith, administrator of Esther Bartholomew, deceased, who was a distributee of the estate of said David Herr, deceased, a certain sum of money; whereupon he entered into a bond with Charles Edwards, as his surety, in the sum of $2000. The condition whereof was, that the said Matthew Bartholomew should appear at the (then) next term of the Court of Common Pleas of the said county, and then and there present his petition for the benefit of the Insolvent Laws of this Commonwealth, and comply with all the requisitions of the said law, and abide all the orders of the said court in that behalf, or in default thereof, and if he fail in obtaining his discharge as an insolvent debtor, that he shall surrender himself to the jail of the said county, then such obligation to be void. This bond, on the 14th February 1861, was approved by the court, and on the 15th April 1861, his petition for the benefit of the Insolvent Laws was presented, and according to an endorsement on the petition, an indefinite time was fixed for his hearing, which in fact amounted to nothing. How this omission to fix a definite time, which is the practice of the court, occurred, does not appear. The court has no standing rule in regard to the time when insolvent petitions are to be heard, or in regard to the publication of the same, except the following:— ‘ September 26th 1857. The court direct the following be made a rule of court, that all applications for the benefit of the Insolvent Laws be published for three successive weeks in one German and two English newspapers, printed in the county of Lancaster.’ This rule was not referred to on the argument of this case, and I presume has no bearing upon it, for it evidently was intended to apply to cases where the time of hearing had been designated by the court. It was, however, contended at the argument that it was the duty of BartholomeAY to see that the necessary order Avas made, and to obtain his discharge, or to surrender himself to jail in default thereof, and having failed to do so, that <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>the condition of the bond was forfeited, that he ought to have been the actor in the case. The practice of our court doubtless is, when a petition is presented to ask the court to fix a time for the hearing of the petition; but supposing this was not done, or the court should fix an indefinite time, would this work a forfeiture of the bond ? I think not. The petitioner was bound by the conditions of the bond to comply with the requisitions of the law, and abide the order of the court; but if no order was made, or one which it %vas impossible to fulfil, the non-performance of it would not mulct him in the penalty of the bond. He has done everything which the letter of the law required of him, and the liability of sureties will never be extended by implication, but the condition will in general be construed strictly in their favour. It was as much in the power of the creditor interested in the bond to have the time fixed for the hearing by applying to the court, as the debtor. The right of the creditor to sue the insolvent bond, in my opinion, did not attach until the petitioner failed to present his petition, or failed to comply with the order of the court, or surrender himself according to the conditions of the bond. In the case of Claxton, 1 Ash. 102, Judge King intimates an opinion, that the law requires a petitioner to be discharged at the same term at which the petition is presented, unless the cause should be regularly postponed by the court beyond the term to which the petition is presented. This opinion, however, was predicated upon the former Insolvent Laws, and the conditions of the bond required by that law were somewhat different from the one required by the present law; besides, the Supreme Court has decided that the time for the surrender is the day fixed for the hearing of the case, should the court on that day refuse to discharge the prisoner. I am therefore of opinion that the case falls within the principle of law, which holds that if a condition of a bond be possible at the time of making it, and afterwards becomes impossible by the act of the law, then the penalty of obligation is saved: 2 Bl. Com. 340.</p>

Did they see that the proper time was fixed by the court, and a proper record thereof was made ? Did they see that there was a publication of notice of the time and place of hearing ?

The court (having no standing rule in matter of insolvents) made an order impossible of performance. Does the failure to perform an impossibility ordered, render the surety liable ? This is the sole question. The court is to fix the time; they fix a blank time. If the party fill the blank to suit himself, can it be said the court fixed the time; and would a party thus fixing a time be entitled to a discharge ? Courts are presumed to do right in all things, but there is no such violent presumption as that they are incapable of mistake, especially in the face of the record and their own declaration that they made one.

The first section of the Act of 16th June 1836, gives power to grant relief to insolvent debtors, in the manner provided. The mode is for the debtor to come into court, present his application, ask a hearing, give notice of it to his creditors, exhibit the state o'f his affairs, take the required oath, <a id="p200" href="#p200" data-label="200" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*200</a>make an assignment, and ask for Ms final discharge. In all this, he is the actor and only one to set in motion the machinery of the law, which is to result in his discharge. His creditor performs no part of it, is not bound to appear, and cannot prevent his discharge except by showing that he is not a fit subject of relief. He may appear to do this, but it is not to do an act in furtherance of the discharge but against it. The purpose then is relief, the provisions of the law must be pursued, and the debtor is the only one who sets them in motion and keeps them moving.</p>
    <p id="b200-6" data-blocks='[["BL_200.4",200,[293,825,1164,427]]]'>The bond is but a part of the machinery. Its purpose is temporary enlargement while prosecuting the necessary measures for relief; and to enable him to prosecute them with more convenience than he could under confinement. Its purpose is also to secure his creditor by compelling him to proceed towards his discharge in due course of law, or to return himself into prison in case he fails to procure his discharge. This being the purpose, it is clear that no construction of the bond can be right which postpones the discharge indefinitely, and at the same time prevents his return into the power of his creditor.</p>

If, by the failure of the court, the proceeding has come to a stand, and no duty rests upon him to extricate it from this dead-lock, he has failed to obtain his discharge, and he must perform the alternative by surrendering himself to prison. But if he is unwilling to accept the alternative, and claims his right to keep the proceeding in motion, then clearly his duty is to have the omission of the court corrected at the earliest moment, by 'asking it to fix a day for his hearing. Supposing that he may fairly deny the forfeiture of his bond at the time when the court, by its omission, prevented his immediate action; yet, being the only actor in the case, and his duty being to go forward in pursuit of the relief, he was bound to come into court at the next term at farthest, and renew his application for a hearing. Indeed it may be — but it is unnecessary to decide this — he was bound to see that a day was fixed for his hearing, or at least a continuance of his application granted. But, certainly, an appearance at the next term was due from him, as the actor seeking a relief he could obtain only by pursuing it, and as a proper measure of protection of his creditors, to whom he had become bound. If we assume that he need not move, and that his total cessation is no failure to procure his discharge, he is set at liberty without any security to his creditor, and may take himself beyond the reach of his process without remedy.
