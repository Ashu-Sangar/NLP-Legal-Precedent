In order to have discharged the trust thus undertaken by them, they ought to have sold the lands intrusted to them for the payment of the debts and legacies within a year after the testator’s death, and to have paid the debts and legacies with the moneys arising therefrom. Neglecting, however, it would seem, to proceed in this way, they were sued by William Morris, a creditor of the testator, <em>before the year </em>expired, and a judgment obtained for the amount of his claim within less than three months after the commencement of the suit. The executors, however, notwithstanding this early and complete notice.of Morris’s debt, which the testator had expressly made a charge upon the land in dispute, still neglected to raise money by a sale thereof, as was their duty, to pay this debt.” Again he says: “ The executors, or more properly speaking, James and Robert Blaine, who took upon themselves the offices of executors and trustees, were merely entitled to the surplus of the residuary estate, if any should remain after paying the debts and previous legacies; and it is not to be tolerated that any lapse of time shbuld operate in their favour, so as to give them an interest, or to increase it beyond what they would have a right to upon a faithful execution of the trust, short of that which would raise a presumption of the debts and legacies having all been satisfied.”</p>

The debt was now a record liability, expiring only upon payment or the presumption of it from lapse of time. But for the decision in Penn <em>v. </em>Hamilton, it would now have been an indefinite lien, the Act of 1797 having been satisfied by the performance of its condition, viz. the bringing of suit prosecuted to judgment long before the limitation could visit the debt. The very purpose of the doctrine of Penn <em>v. </em>Hamilton was to further limit the lien of the debt, <a id="p525" href="#p525" data-label="525" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*525</a>which must become indefinite by performing the condition of the Act of 1797, and therefore it held that the judgment obtained must be revived within the period of five years after the seven years had run, by <em>scire facias, </em>in analogy to the requirement of the Act of 1798. Now we see the true principle of Alexander <em>v. </em>McMurry. What right has a trustee, himself the residuary legatee who has had this early notice of the debt, and whose duty is to sell and to pay the debt, to take advantage of the lapse of time caused by his own postponement of sale and neglect of duty, and thereby put that portion of the proceeds into his own pocket which should have gone to the judgment ? Hence the court well said to him, as against you the testamentary charge is sufficient, and you cannot claim that the judgment must be revived. The doctrine of Penn <em>v. </em>Hamilton does not apply to you. Nothing in that case runs counter to the general doctrine of the court and the state policy as to liens. The debt was not secret, the creditor was not negligent, the statutory limitation had not run, and the residuary legatee was estopped by his own laches.</p>

Admitting that the duty devolved upon the executor to ask the Orphans’ Court for direction to sell under the power, yet no debts had appeared to prompt him, and without legal proof of their existence as a charge on the land, the Orphans’ Court would refuse its direction: Puy’s Appeal, <a href="/watts/8/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="8 Watts 253" data-case-ids="1848398" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0253-01">8 Watts 253</a>; Blawson’s Estate, <a href="/watts-serg/1/0315-01" class="citation" data-index="14" data-cite="1 Watts &amp; Serg. 315" data-case-ids="1852635" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/1/0315-01">1 W. &amp; S. 315</a> ; Brown <em>v. </em>Phillips, 9 Id. 21; Sample <em>v. </em>Barr, 1 Casey 457; Soles <em>v. </em>Hickman, 5 Id. 342. Nine years elapsed had given the devisee an assurance that he might improve his property or sell it without danger from encumbrances. It is clearly the case of a dormant secret lien so much reprobated by the same judges who decided Alexander <em>v. </em>McMurry and Steele <em>v. </em>Henry. It has not a single feature to liken it to those cases. Then we should not be astute to carry their principle beyond their scope, and the views of those who decided them. We should accomplish no good end, but run directly counter to the plain intention of the Act of 1834, and the views of this court upon it as evidenced in the cases of Sample <em>v. </em>Barr, 1 Casey 457, Soles <em>v. </em>Hickman, 5 Id. 342, Walthour’s Heirs <em>v. </em>Gosser, 8 Id. 259, and McGlaughlin <em>v. </em>McCumber, 12 Id. 14. Indeed, I think that Sample <em>v. </em>Barr in effect decides this case. That was a case where the devise was of that part of the testator’s land which should remain after payment of his debts. This court held that the debt must be enforced <a id="p526" href="#p526" data-label="526" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*526</a>by suit against the devisee, otherwise his title was unaffected. In the argument the counsel put the case expressly upon the trust, citing Alexander <em>v. </em>McMurry and Steele <em>v. </em>Henry. Justice Woodward, after stating the devise subject to payment of debts, says, <em>“ </em>that is generally the case, but to assume the existence of the debt which the statute, says shall be proved, and then to argue that the will devised only what remained after the payment of debts, is to sacrifice the statute to a <em>petitio prineipii.” </em>How I take it to be a settled principle that every terre-tenant of an encumbered estate can take advantage of the expiration of the lien of the encumbrance and plead it in bar of the recovery of the debt. It is on this principle the Orphans’ Court acts in refusing to order a sale for payment of debts where the lien has expired.</p>

He is often the chief object of the testator’s regard, who frequently supposes his debts to be few, and that a large surplus will remain. How often men take no account of their debts of suretyship, and of liabilities which are uncertain and contingent ? They become bound for administrators, heirs, tellers, treasurers, and public officers ; and in bonds of indemnity, covenants for title, and other contingent debts which, after death, rise to derange their plans, and strip their families of their bounty. Take away the protection of the limitation of the Act of 1834, and see what consequences must follow. Wills frustrated, expectations disappointed, and families ruined by old and long-dormant claims. The title thus subject to unknown encumbrances becomes embarrassed, and pro<a id="p527" href="#p527" data-label="527" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*527</a>perty can neither be improved nor sold by the devisee. A contingent liability may lie for years before the breach occurs, a question is then presented whether its indefinite aud contingent character as a lien was divested by a sale. The case falls clearly within the very letter and spirit of the Act of 1834. Then why should its requirement of suit or copy, filed within five years, be repealed by the mere reasoning of Alexander <em>v. </em>McMurry, when the judgment there, which is the only precedent, was founded upon a case where the very letter of the act had been complied with ? Had the naked case of a secret lien, lying dormant in the drawer of the creditor for nine years after the testator’s death, been presented to the eminent judge who decided that case, he would not for a moment have held that it was- a continuing lien without suit. Its glaring inconsistency with his own view's and those of his brethren would have brought him to a different result. But there the Act of 1797 being satisfied by an <em>early </em>suit,'he sought only to distinguish the case from Penn <em>v. </em>Hamilton, requiring the <em>judgment </em>to be revived, and he found in the charge of the debt by the will the due notice of the debt, and the laches of the executor himself, the legatee of the fund, a sufficient distinction. But this will not excuse a dormant creditor, and enable him by the charge in the will to embarrass the property, defeat the public policy, and postpone showing title to the trust until the grave has closed over the proofs which would have blown his debt away. Upon this theory of testatorial power to defeat the express words of the law, a bond or note under seal exhumed for the occasion before twenty years have expired, may sweep away the improvements and labour of years.</p>

Shippen’s Heirs <em>v. </em>Clapp, 5 Casey 265, and Shippen’s Executors <em>v. </em>Clapp, 12 Id. 89, have no application. In Hare <em>v. </em>Boyd, 6 Barr 267, the decision was against the debt as stale by lapse of time, and because the judgment confessed by one of the executors more than thirty years after the testator’s death,.was void against the co-executors and the estate. Deferring to Alexander <em>v. </em>McMurry, Justice Coulter remarked: <em>“ </em>The decision goes on the ground that the executors were guilty of laches and gross negligence in not selling the property and performing the trust confided to them <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>by the testator, and that such negligence ought not to prejudice the creditor.”</p>

No case brought to my notice, or of which I have any knowledge, has ever decided that a general direction to sell real estate for the payment of debts, not ascertained or identified, will extend the lien of these debts indefinitely, without suit or notice by filing a copy under the Act of 1834.</p>

In the 24th section the term of limitation is reduced to five years, recognisances and all record-debts not secured by mortgage or judgment are excluded from the exception; and the proviso as to married women, minors, &amp;c., is dropped.</p>

In reference to the exception in favour of married women, minors, &amp;c., they say: “We have also omitted the proviso to the 4th section of the Act of 1797, which continues the lien in certain cases to an extent which we think operates very injuriously for the general interest by impeding the transfer of real estate.”</p>

The 34th provides: “ In <em>all </em>actions against the executors or administrators of a decedent who shall have left real estate, where the plaintiff intends to charge such real estate with the payment of his debts, the widow and heirs or <em>devisees </em>
      <a id="p529" href="#p529" data-label="529" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*529</a>and the guardians of such as are minors, <em>shall </em>be made parties thereto.” But if the creditor’s debt is founded in the paramount trust, which can continue the lien without suit, logically it may be argued that he is not entitled to notice. But this has been answered by Sample <em>v. </em>Barr, <em>ante, </em>which decides that the creditor is subject to the provision of this section notwithstanding the trust. The 25th section fixes the lien of judgment existing at death, at the same period of five years, and requires the lien to be continued by revival. A record-debt, therefore, will lose its lien as between it and other lien-creditors unless revived. Now it would be a most absurd anomaly, that unrecorded, unknown, and dormant debts should have their lien continued by the dash of a testator’s pen, while record-liens must be preserved by process, in order to. maintain their place beside other creditors. The 42d section of the Act of 1834 exempts real estate from the lien of debts upon a sale in partition made two years after the granting of the letters upon the estate. The 52d section of the Act of 16th July 1842 applies the favourite legislative period of five years to debts, when the proceeds of a sale for distribution are taken to pay them. These provisions furnish strong analogies and exhibit the determination of the legislature to fix a limit to the encumbrances upon the real estate of a decedent. In the light of all these provisions and the judicial decisions upon them, let us read the language of the 24th section of the Act of 1834. It is peremptory and general. “ <em>No debts </em>of a decedent, except they be secured by mortgage or judgment, <em>shall </em>remain a lien on real estate for a longer period than five years after the decease of such debtors unless, an action for the recovery,” &amp;c. It seems to me it is not possible to find language which expresses more clearly the legislative intent to bring all debts to the test of this limitation, else why the exception of mortgage and judgment debts.
