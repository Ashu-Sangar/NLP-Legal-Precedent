The weather was, at that time, very dry and windy, the wind blowing strong across the road towards plaintiff’s house. Sparks were seen flying from the engines to the distance of more than 50 yards from the road, and fences and fields were set on fire in several places about the same time, and at considerable distances from the road.</p>

It is a question of fact, whether the small sparks that escape through a good spark-catcher will ignite wood at such a distance. We see wooden houses, and lumber, and firewood, and shingles standing all along the very edge of railroads without being burnt; how can we say that the happening of several fires, all about the same time, along the line of the road, is no evidence of carelessness ?</p>
