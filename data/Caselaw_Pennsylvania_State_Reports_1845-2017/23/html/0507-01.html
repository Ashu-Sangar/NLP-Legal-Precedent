Void for want of signature, was the will validated by the subsequent Act of 1848 ? Undoubtedly it was if the legislature were competent to pass a retroactive law on the subject, for this will is within the very words of the enactment. But in Greenough <em>v. </em>Greenough, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20489" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Jones 489">1 <em>Jones </em>489</a>, it was demonstrated by the late chief justice that the Act of 1848, so far as it was retroactive, was unconstitutional and void. The same thing was asserted again in Snyder <em>v. </em>Bull, 5 <em>Harris </em>58. This conclusion has our hearty concurrence. As the law of the case stands, therefore, we are obliged to say that this will was not duly executed, and was, consequently, an abortive attempt at a testamentary disposition.</p>
