That if the jury believed that the people generally in the neighborhood of this road, have used it as a horse and foot path without hindrance or obstruction for fifty years, then the plaintiff has failed to show that it is his private way, and he could only recover by averring in his declaration, and proving some extraordinary and special damage suffered by himself. 2d. That under the pleadings and evidence in this cause, if it has been used as a public foot path, the plaintiff cannot recover. 3d. That if the jury believe, that where this right of way is claimed, had been uninclosed woodland, and was cleared and fenced by the defendant for the purpose of farming and tillage, he was protected in doing so and authorized by the Act of Assembly of the 25th April, 1850, and the plaintiff cannot recover.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b502-7" data-blocks='[["BL_502.5",502,[354,1280,1157,557]]]'>The first point was answered in the affirmative. In respect to the question involved in the <em>second </em>point, the Court submitted to the jury to inquire whether the evidence showed a private right by such user by which the Court intimated such a right of way could be acquired; but instructed them that if the way had been used as a public foot path, common to the use of any person who had occasion to use it as a foot path, the plaintiff could not recover under the evidence and pleadings in the case. As to the <em>third </em>point, the Court instructed the jury that the Act of 25th April, 1850,-in relation to roads through uninclosed woodland, did not give the owner of the land the right to obstruct a road by fencing where a right of way had been acquired by use for the length of time from which such a right would be presumed.</p>

    <p id="b503-11" data-blocks='[["BL_503.13",503,[179,1527,1162,129]]]'>1st. That the right of way was a public and not a private right, and therefore there could be no recovery, as no special damage was alleged or proven.</p>
    <p id="b503-12" data-blocks='[["BL_503.14",503,[181,1654,1160,132]]]'>2d. That if the right was a private one the defendant was justified in putting his fence across the path by the Act of 25th of April, 1850.</p>
    <p id="b503-13" data-blocks='[["BL_503.15",503,[182,1784,1159,257]]]'>The first ground was affirmed by the Court of Common Pleas, but it was left to the jury to say from the evidence whether the right was public or private. This was so clearly correct that it needs no argument to sustain it. The point submitted was this: “ That under the pleadings and evidence in this cause, if it has been used as a public foot path, the plaintiff cannot recover.”</p>
    <p id="b503-14" data-blocks='[["BL_503.16",503,[182,2040,1158,172]]]'>To which the answer was: “ If it has been used as a public foot path common to the use of any person who has occasion to use it as a foot path, the plaintiff cannot recover under the evidence and pleadings in the case.”</p>
    <p id="b503-15" data-blocks='[["BL_503.17",503,[181,2211,1159,214]]]'>It is difficult to perceive how the point could have been more directly affirmed, and yet we have two errors assigned upon the answer. “ 1st.

    <p id="b504-5" data-blocks='[["BL_504.3",504,[331,400,1159,343]]]'>
      <a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>These assignments are sufficiently answered by what has already been said, viz. That the point was answered according to its prayer, and the question submitted as requested. Where the Court is asked to instruct the jury that if they find a certain state of facts, then the law is as stated, it will not do after an affirmative answer to allege that it was error to leave the question at all to the jury. Cases would seldom be finally disposed of if judgments were reversed upon such grounds.</p>
    <p id="b504-6" data-blocks='[["BL_504.4",504,[332,744,1154,85]]]'>The second assignment arises under the construction of an Act of Assembly passed 25th April, 1850, in the following words</p>
    <p id="b504-7" data-blocks='[["BL_504.5",504,[329,829,1159,339]]]'>“ No right of way shall hereafter be acquired by user where such way passes through uninclosed woodland; but on clearing such woodland the owner or owners thereof shall be at liberty to enclose the same, as if no such way had been used through the same before such clearing and inclosure: Provided, that the provisions of this section shall in no way affect any suit or suits now pending in any of the Courts of this Commonwealth in relation to any right of way or any other matter embraced in this section.”</p>
    <p id="b504-8" data-blocks='[["BL_504.6",504,[321,1168,1170,799]]]'>It was held by the Court of Common Pleas that this Act did not apply to a case where the right was perfect before its passage. In this there was no error. It would be a manifest perversion of the language of the statute to give it a retroactive effect. This is never done unless in obedience to a legislative mandate clear and unequivocal, and not then if within the constitutional prohibition. Were the rule otherwise 'the case would still have been properly decided, for here the language most clearly refers to rights to be acquired after the passage of the Act — “ No right of way shall be hereafter acquired by user, &amp;c.” The legislative intention, as here expressed, is too plain to be controlled by an inference deduced from the proviso that the Act should not affect pending suits. This was inserted from an abundant caution to prevent what has too often resulted from legislative action, viz. interference with existing rights by a denial or change of remedies. After having provided by apt words that the Act should be prospective only, a-superfluous addition is made that pending suits shall not be affected. The first includes the last provision, but the last does not destroy the first.</p>
    <p id="b504-9" data-blocks='[["BL_504.7",504,[320,1978,1161,255]]]'>The jury, after agreeing upon their verdict, sealed it up and separated. Upon its presentation in Court it was found to be deficient in not assessing any sum as damages. Against the objection of defendant’s counsel the Court refused to receive the verdict, but referred it back to the jury, with directions to assess the damages, which was afterwards done at one dollar.</p>
    <p id="b504-10" data-blocks='[["BL_504.8",504,[320,2234,1157,131]],["BL_505.1",505,[192,400,1162,218]]]'>It is very evident that the principal if not the only matter of contest between the parties was as to the right of recovery. No special damage was claimed, and the amount found was merely <a id="p505" href="#p505" data-label="505" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*505</a>nominal. This is substantially the same as the first finding, which was generally for the plaintiff. The change was therefore merely formal, and properly allowed. Due regard for the administration of justice requires that considerable discretion in this respect should be given to the Court before whom the trial takes place.</p>
