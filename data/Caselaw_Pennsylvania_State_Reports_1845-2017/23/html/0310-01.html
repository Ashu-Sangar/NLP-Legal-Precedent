The Act of 1849, allowing a debtor to retain, exempt from execution, property to the amount of $300, or money from the sales to that amount, was not to take effect until the 4th July, 1849, and was to apply “only to debts contracted on and after that date.” Property to the amount of $300 not having been set apart to the defendant, the question was, whether he was entitled to a part of the proceeds of sale to the amount of $300, or a less amount. Before the auditor appointed, $300 was claimed for the debtor. The claim was resisted by creditors.</p>

David Candor <em>v. </em>Same—entered November 30,1849, for $400. Interest from day of entry. Next, judgment of R. C. Hale <em>v. </em>Same—entered August 4, 1850, for $146.53. Interest from 7th August, 1850. Another judgment followed, viz., judgment of <em>Henry </em>Smith — entered to November Term, 1850, for $200. Interest from October 12, 1850.

The Court decided that Candor must first resort to the $300, which Guthrie could not, and by this means Guthrie will get his whole debt. This is in effect deciding that Guthrie, whose debt arose after the 4th July, 1849, has more equity than the debtor has under the Exemption Act. No process of subrogation should be resorted to to deprive him of such - right. In this case all of the debts contracted before the Act of 1849 took effect, can be paid, and $300 be left for the debtor. (Thus: Candor’s, $288.11; costs, $26.11; Hale’s, $166.04 — $480.26.)</p>

The difficulty in the case grows out of his claim to the sum of $300 ■under the exemption law. Setting that sum apart for the present, we have the residue — $641.50—to dispose of among the parties entitled; and it seems to require no argument to show that it ought to be appropriated to the judgment-creditors in the order of their liens upon the estate which produced it. As the judgments in favor of Candor and Guthrie are the two oldest liens, they are entitled to this money. As they were both entered on the same day, and amount to sufficient to exhaust this fund, it must be distributed between them <em>pro rata. </em>Thus far the case seems entirely clear of doubt or difficulty.</p>

If the Act of 1849 is to be carried into effect, it is certain that the judgments entered upon debts contracted after the 4th July, 1849, cannot dispute the debtor’s right to this portion of the fund, no matter what may be the order of their liens. Their claims to this money are therefore out of question. The only judgments which can contest the debtor’s right, with any show of plausibility, are those founded on debts contracted before the 4th July, 1849. Those debts, according to the express provisions of the exemption law, are not in any manner affected by it. The two judgments in favor'of Candor and Hale, respectively, so far as they are founded on debts of this character, have a claim to the money superior of that of the debtor. Rut it appears that only a portion of the Candor judgment is founded on a debt of this grade. After crediting the money to be received under the <em>pro rata </em>distribution, already directed, there will be but a small <a id="p314" href="#p314" data-label="314" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*314</a>sum due to Candor on that part of his judgment.
