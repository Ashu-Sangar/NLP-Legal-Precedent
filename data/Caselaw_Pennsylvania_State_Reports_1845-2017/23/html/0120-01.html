It was contended that the possession of Hellings was such as to put Wood on inquiry. Though he were a mere <em>intruder, </em>it was said that he possessed such information as would have led the plaintiff to a discovery of the claim of defendant. If the plaintiff had inquired of Hellings, he would have found that he was in possession not under the <em>heirs </em>of Jane Vanschuyver, and that Hellings could have told him that the land had been sold to Osmond under an order of Orphans’ Court, as the property of James H. Wright; and that on the 21st October, 1846, about six weeks before Wood obtained his title, the sheriff had, <em>on the premises, </em>made sale of this land to Wright, the defendant, under the execution against Osmond. Hellings paid dower charged on the land to the widow of James Wright, deceased. He held the possession in subordination to the title under which the defendant claims.</p>

None of the Vanschuyvers had been in possession of it from 1821 till the conveyance to Wood, the plaintiff, in 1847, a period of 26 years. Nothing but the coverture of Jane Vanschuyver prevented the operation of the statute of limitations.</p>
    <p id="b128-7" data-blocks='[["BL_128.5",128,[298,1508,1160,726]]]'>4. It was further contended, that the Orphans’ Court and sheriff’s sale of this land amounted to notice to Wood. The doctrine of <em>lis pendens </em>is not constructive notice of a prior unregistered deed; and the suits between Wright’s administrators and Osmond had been prosecuted to judgment <em>before </em>the purchase by Wood (3 <em>Atk. </em>391); yet it was suggested whether <em>judicial sales </em>do not place a purchaser in a different position than a suit pending: <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%2046" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="10 Watts 46">10 <em>Watts </em>46</a>, and 5 <em><a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%2046" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="10 Watts 46">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%2046" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="10 Watts 46">77</a>, 14 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>118. The sale in 1846 under the judgment against Osmond was held on 21st Oct., 1846, and the deed was acknowledged on 9th Nov., 1846; and on the 1st Dec., 1846, two of the Vansehuyvers conveyed to Wood, and others conveyed to him on 21st Dec., 1846, and on 3d Jan., 1847. The sheriff’s sale was held at the time the plaintiff was about to purchase, and it was held on the premises. It was said, that, at all events, the jury would have had the right to infer knowledge by Wood from these facts, which should have been submitted to the jury.</p>

The only possession at the time of Wood’s purchase and for several years before was that of Hellings. He did not hold under Wright, the defendant, or any person under whom Wright claimed. He was a mere intruder. The law formerly was that notice of a <em>tenancy </em>will not affect a purchaser with constructive notice of the lessor’s title: 2 <em>Sugden </em>293; but it is now settled that possession of <em>a tenant </em>is notice of his actual interest whether as lessee or purchaser: <a href="/watts/7/0382-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="7 Watts 382" data-case-ids="1846806" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0382-01">7 <em>Watts </em>382</a>, Woods <em>v. </em>Farmere. But the possession of <em>an intruder </em>is evidence of <em>Ms </em>interest in the premises and no more: 6 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>469, Boggs <em>v. </em>Varner. If Hellings was tenant of no one, he was not the agent of any one, and it was said that the information derived from him would have been of the character of common rumor, which would have been insufficient: <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%2078" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="2 Watts 78">2 <em>Watts </em>78</a>; 7 <em><a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%2078" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="2 Watts 78">Id. </a></em><a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%2078" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="2 Watts 78">167</a>. It was further said that before Wood could be affected with notice of the unrecorded deed, it should have been shown that Hellings possessed requisite information and that he would have communicated it. Knowledge of the possession has not the effect of visiting the purchaser with every fact and circumstance which he might have learned by making inquiry of the person in possession: 1 <em>Barr </em>474, Hood <em>v. </em>Fahnestock. Hellings did not rent of any one, and there was no connexion between his possession and the unrecorded deed.</p>
    <p id="b129-8" data-blocks='[["BL_129.6",129,[160,1774,1159,343]]]'>There was no evidence of actual notice by Wood of the sheriff’s sale in 1846. Besides, it may have been that the right of Osmond was only to two-thirds of the premises, which would have been consistent with the purchase of the other third, for which alone the plaintiff obtained a verdict. The deed to Osmond was left for record by Wright himself in 1848, in order to complete the chain of title to him, after Wood had bought and had his deeds recorded, the deed to Osmond never having been delivered to him.</p>

It was not the instrument upon which the suit was founded, and Wright, the defendant below, was in no wise connected with it. It was offered solely for the purpose of showing that the possession of Anson was under Wood, and having been proved by one of the parties to it, the rule which requires proof by subscribing witnesses was inapplicable.

The deed from which the defendant below deduced his title, was prior in point of time to that of the plaintiff from the heirs at law of defendant’s grantor. It had never been recorded, and thus it became essential to prove that the plaintiff had either actual or constructive notice of its existence. The charge of the President of the Common Pleas upon this branch of the case, contains an elaborate review of all the evidence relied upon to prove notice of the defendant’s title. Without examining it in detail, it is sufficient to say that the effort to show actual notice was a failure. It would have been clearly erroneous had the jury been permitted to find actual notice from the communication made by Hellings to Squires and Anson.</p>
    <p id="b130-11" data-blocks='[["BL_130.9",130,[347,1983,1158,386]]]'>As to constructive notice. The possession of one either in person or by his tenant is notice of his unrecorded title; but the possession of an intruder cannot be held to be notice of the title of a stranger. The evidence was clear that the possession of Hellings had no connexion -whatever with the title under which the defendant claimed. It is barely possible that an inquiry of Hellings would have elicited some information in regard to the claim of Wright. A mere possibility will not suffice to obviate a difficulty occasioned by the neglect to comply with the recording acts.</p>
