It was long an institution among our Anglo-Saxon ancestors; and perhaps it was never positively abolished, but rather died out under the influence of the Norman conquest, and the centralizing powers of the king’s Courts, which treated all such wrongs as wrongs done to the king — and hence as criminal offences. It seems to have been an institution common to all Germanic nations, and perhaps to every people that rose one degree above the savage life, and were still striving to rise. With them it was intended as a compensation to surviving kindred, and as a means of preventing the disorders that follow in the train of private revenge.</p>

Yet the English Courts have not known how to estimate the damages, except according to the value of the life lost: 10 <em>Eng. L. </em>&amp; <em>Eq. Rep. </em>437; Armsworth <em>v. </em>S. E.

The precept involved in the law is, “ Thou shalt not by negligence or violence take away the life of anotherand the sanction of the law lies in the duty of compensation for the life destroyed, measured according to its own merits and not according to the necessities and circumstances of his kindred.

But it is the best standard we have, and in practice it is not found to be absurd. The duty of the wrongdoer to make compensation is very plain, and such as he has, which the law can reach, it compels him to give: though it may never reach the consciousness of the person injured. It is an. act of distributive justice in vindication of invaded right, and it adopts the best approximation to compensation, which the authority of the law can enforce. And in these times, when criminal justice presents so many symptoms of going out of repute, and police officers are so often held up to public indignation for their performance of duty, it is found to operate well. Call it punitive; yet it is only indirectly so, as all compensation is, and does not wipe out any offence that is involved against the state. From our present experience and observation, therefore, we are unable to discover any substantial error in the instructions complained of. It would be wrong to limit the value of a man’s life by his probable accumulations, for many men make none in a lifetime, and many have arrived at an age when they no longer attempt to make any, and many women never make any; and yet every one is entitled to his life, and we have as yet discovered no standard for its valuation.
