This is a question of intention; and, applying the principles settled in Levering <em>v. </em>Rittenhouse, <a href="/whart/4/0130-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Whart. 130" data-case-ids="1835004" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0130-01">4 <em>Wh. </em>130</a>, King’s Case, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Whart.%20373" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="6 Whart. 373">6 <em>Wh. </em>373</a>, and Haverstock <em>v. </em>Sarbach, 1 W. &amp; <em>Ser. </em>392, to the facts in evidence before the auditor, we have no difficulty in affirming the judgment of the Orphans’ Court that this was a gift and not an advancement. Mr. Snowden made no charge against his sons for the money and stock in trade with which he set them up, and they gave him no note or other memorandum to indicate that they owed him anything. He often spoke of it as a present or gift to his sons, and never as an advancement. He had made valuable presents to his married daughters; and it is reasonable to infer that what he gave to start his sons was intended in the same manner to be gifts. Nor is this inference excluded by the proportion of the gift to his whole estate. Twenty-five hundred dollars given to each of two sons is not an extravagant provision for a father worth twenty-five thousand dollars, and whose other three children were married daughters. Deducing his intention from what we have in evidence of the transaction, we think the sound conclusion is that he meant a gift rather than an advancement ; and the character impressed then must remain. That which was a gift at first cannot become advancement, no more than an advancement can become a gift.</p>
