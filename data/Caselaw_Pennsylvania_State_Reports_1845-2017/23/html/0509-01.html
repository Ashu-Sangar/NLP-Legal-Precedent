To this A. J. and O.

They were, in truth, two debts, differently authenticated and secured ; and the payment of one of them does not affect the existence or amount of the other.

It is the policy of the law that the highest price should be obtained at the least expense. It is against the interest of debtors and creditors that the property should be sold for less than its value, or that the proceeds should be eaten up by the costs of unnecessary proceedings. Common humanity requires that the misfortunes of life should not be aggravated by such harshness, and common justice demands that legal proceedings should not be made a snare for innocent citizens who repose confidence in them. When the officers of the law sell the real estate of a debtor for the price publicly bid for it, it is unjust to exact anything more than the sum thus agreed to be paid, or to deprive the purchaser of the benefit of his purchase, by means of encumbrances not understood- to be continuing liens. Such an act in an individual would be condemned as a fraud. It loses none of its turpitude by being clothed in the garb of public authority. Even the boasted omnipotence of Parliament cannot change the code of morals, and make that just which is in its nature absolutely wrong. In accordance with these principles, it was the settled law, in regard to judicial sales for the payment of debts, that the parties interested were not put to the expense of any more than one sale — that such a sale worked an absolute conversion of the property into money, and consequently discharged the land in the hands of the purchaser from all encumbrances which in their nature admitted of being reduced to certainty in amount. It substituted the proceeds for the land, and gave to the lien-creditors a claim on the fund instead of their liens on the land. The salutary effect of this rule was, that it encouraged competition at such sales, and property brought its full value. The plain business man could bid with as much safety as the more wary speculator. Thus, all parties interested in the property derived the full advantage of its conversion into money. But the Act of 1830 changed this policy so far as to protect the holders of mortgages, having prior liens, from sales under judgments entered subsequently. Under that statute several sales are necessary where one was sufficient before. Whether the title or a mere equity of redemption is sold, depends upon circumstances not always known or easily ascertained at the sale. Hence, no one can safely bid at a sheriff’s sale without previously examining the records for judgments, mortgages, and other liens not only against the defendant in the execution, but against all persons who had ever before had any interest in the property. New men are willing to put themselves to the trouble and expense of these searches <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>on a mere possibility that they may become the purchasers. The field is, therefore, abandoned to those who follow the business of making profit out of the misfortunes of their fellows. These men generally obtain their purchases at a price so low as to indemnify themselves against the risks they encounter. But if a creditor, anxious to secure his demand, or a business man, desirous of obtaining a place for his business, or a home for himself and his family, ventures to run the property up to its value, he frequently discovers, after it is too late to recede, that a mortgage exists against the property which sweeps it away from him after he has paid all that it is worth.</p>
    <p id="b514-6" data-blocks='[["BL_514.4",514,[341,870,1161,1538]],["BL_515.1",515,[185,395,1167,1020]]]'>Many innocent men have been ruined by the purchase of property at judicial sales since the Act of 1830. After ten years’ experience of the evils produced by that Act, the Supreme Court, in 1840, declared that “ the consequences of the Act, wherever we have had occasion to observe them, have been disastrous:” <a href="/whart/6/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="6 Whart. 216" data-case-ids="1836966" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0216-01">6 <em>Wharton </em>216</a>. After fourteen years’ further opportunity to witness the operation of that statute, we are compelled to bear the same testimony against it. Under its provisions no unlearned man can with safety bid at a judicial sale. It was therefore very properly held in Berger <em>v. </em>Hiester, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Whart.%20214" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="6 Whart. 214">6 <em>Wharton </em>214</a>, that “ the disastrous consequences of the Act is a legitimate reason why it should not be pushed beyond the supposed mischief;” and, in the same ease, it was distinctly declared that “ the design of the Act was to protect the mortgagee from the intermeddling of subsequent creditors,” and that “a judgment-creditor <em>who is himself the prior mortgagee, </em>was not to be deemed a <em>subsequent creditor </em>within the purview of the statute, or, <em>in his capacity of mortgagee, an object of protection against himself.” “ </em>When he appears in a double capacity,” it was held “that a case has arisen which was not contemplated nor consequently provided for:” <a href="/whart/6/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="6 Whart. 216" data-case-ids="1836966" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0216-01">6 <em>Wharton </em>216</a>. Although the authority cited was the case of a sale on one of the mortgage bonds, it was declared that “ this made no difference— that the consequences would be the same were the securities arising out of different transactions;” and the case was put upon the impregnable ground that the Act was not intended to protect the mortgagee against himself — that <em>the sale was by virtue of a judgment wider his own control, and that by not proposing to sell subject to his mortgage he was taleen to sell discharged of it: </em><a href="/whart/6/0216-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="6 Whart. 216" data-case-ids="1836966" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0216-01">6 <em>Wharton </em>216</a>. That principle settles the case before us. It is, in my opinion, the true meaning of the statute. We have, therefore, sound principle as well as a binding authority in support of the justice of this case. The property in question was sold by virtue of a judgment under the control of Dr. Gibson, the mortgagee, and it was not offered for sale subject to the mortgage. He must therefore be taken to have sold discharged of it. The purchaser took a clear title, and the proceeds should be distributed <a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>among all the lien creditors according to their priority. If the sale were held to he within the operation of the Act of 1830, the result would he that the owner of the property must lose the use of it for a year, and must pay to those who thus wrong him the sum of $1500 to get it back; and those who purchased it and agreed to pay for it, instead of fulfilling their contract, are allowed a premium for violating it! Justice forbids the sanction of such gross iniquity. In my opinion the proper way to do justice in this .case is to enforce the true construction of the Act of 1830 by holding that it was not designed to protect mortgagees against their own acts. But, without affirming or denying the soundness of this construction, the majority of the judges have determined to relieve the mortgagee from the hardship of his case by sending the cause back with such directions as will enable the Court of Common Pleas to set aside the sale. As a general rule, ignorance of the law is no ground for relief from the obligation of a contract. But where the contract is made in some sort with the Courts themselves, and where the highest of these tribunals has actually represented that the purchaser, under circumstances like those existing in this case, would take the land discharged of encumbrances, either that representation ought to be carried out, or the purchaser, acting on the faith of it, should be relieved. Failing to secure the first, I resort to the second as the only alternative left. For these reasons I concur in the decree.</p>
