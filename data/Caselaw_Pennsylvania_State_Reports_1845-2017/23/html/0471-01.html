    <p id="b472-10" data-blocks='[["BL_472.10",472,[329,1262,1157,544]]]'>It is not in Penrose <em>v. </em>Pawling, for that decides only that an administrator plaintiff, who received his costs paid by the defendant on an appeal from an award, is personally liable for the costs thus received, if he be finally defeated in the action; and this admits that he is not personally liable for the costs generally. What he had personally received as his costs, to which he was conditionally entitled, he must personally refund on the failure of the condition, to wit: on losing the final judgment. This puts the parties in the final judgment, personally, in the same relative condition that they were in before the suit began, and is equivalent to judgment against the assets for the general costs of the defendant. Such is also the case of McWilliams <em>v. </em>Hopkins, <a href="/whart/1/0275-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Whart. 275" data-case-ids="1829043" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0275-01">1 <em>Whart. </em>275</a>.</p>

The defendant did not recover his costs from the administrator in that case by virtue of the judgment, but under a special 'decree, founded on testimony specially taken, and showing that the suit was vexatious, and for this reason the decree was affirmed here. This, therefore, is merely the affirmance of another principle of law that makes an administrator plaintiff liable for costs when he is defeated in a wanton and vexatious suit: <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Wend.%20552" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 Wend. 552">7 <em>Wend. </em>552</a>; <a href="/denio/1/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="1 Denio 276" data-case-ids="484033" data-case-paths="/denio/1/0276-01">1 <em>Denio </em>276</a>; 3 <em>Bos. &amp; Pul. </em>115; 5 <em>Id. </em>72; 9 <em>Bing. 754. </em>And hereby our question is implicitly, yet plainly negatived, notwithstanding some loose expressions that seem to cover a broader principle than was demanded by the case.</p>

And there are other evidences of the law still more abundant and convincing. The old English statutes, giving-costs against plaintiffs, have always been construed not to apply as against executors and administrators; and subject to the modification above alluded to, we have followed the law as we got it there. The statute 3 Jac. 1, c. 8, requires bail in error for debt and costs; but this is held not to apply to administrators, plaintiffs in error, because they are not personally liable for either debt or costs: <em>Cro. Jac. </em>350; 4 <em>Mod. </em>245. And such, ánd for the same reason, is the construction of the terms of appeal from an award under our Act of 1810: <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Binn.%20400" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="5 Binn. 400">5 <em>Binn. </em>400</a>; and from Nisi Prius, 2 <em>State Rep: </em>404.</p>
    <p id="b473-6" data-blocks='[["BL_473.4",473,[206,919,1162,301]]]'>The English decisions afterwards received the sanction of stat. 16 and 17 Car. 2, c. 8, s. 5, which, in requiring bail in error, excepts the case of executors and administrators. And this statute was in force with us until superseded by our more recent statutes to the same effect in the eases of writs of error and appeals of every kind from courts, awards, justices of the peace, and under the Act of 1846, concerning bail and attachment.</p>
    <p id="b473-7" data-blocks='[["BL_473.5",473,[201,1221,1167,471]]]'>But the denial of the principle of Ewing <em>v. </em>Furness is much more direct and positive in the statutes that forbid justices of the peace to enter judgment or issue execution against administrators personally (Act of 1810), or that execution issue against'them at all where there is a deficiency of assets, and requires that the remedy shall proceed in the Orphans’ Court against the estate of the decedent: Act of 1834, concerning executors and administrators. With us, therefore, a general judgment against administrators, whether plaintiffs or defendants, is always against them officially, and to be paid by them out of the assets, and not personally. And such being the judgment, such must be the execution.</p>
    <p id="b473-8" data-blocks='[["BL_473.6",473,[205,1692,1163,215]]]'>Nobody has ever supposed that on a general judgment against a defendant administrator, who has unsuccessfully resisted a claim against the estate, he is personally liable for the costs; and we can see no essential difference in this regard between an unsuccessful prosecution and an unsuccessful resistance of a claim.</p>

It regards all governmental, and especially judicial decisions, as the official representations of the public will in relation to civil rights and duties, and as being entitled to respect and reverence for this simple reason.
