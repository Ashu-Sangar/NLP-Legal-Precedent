      <a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>This was an appeal by John Davis, guardian of a minor child of the decedent, 'from the decree of the said Court, upon the account of Amos Vansant, administrator of the estate of Simpson Torbert, deceased. The intestate died in 1838, leaving a widow and one child. In June, 1838, administration was granted to Cor-yell and Vansant. The inventory exceeded $9000. On 14th December, 1840, Vansant filed a separate account, showing a balance in his hands of $1800.03. On 8th February, 1841, Coryell submitted an account showing a balance in his hands of $8100.97. In the balance was included his own note for $1460, — two notes of himself and Murray, one for $2632.55, and the other for $3200, and also ten shares of Beaver Meadow stock, amounting to $500, being its par value.</p>

The auditor did not report till 1847; and previous thereto, viz. in December, 1842, on the petition of Vansant and of one of the sureties in the administration bond, <em>Qoryell, </em>on failure to give additional .security, was dismissed, and on 16th January 1843 he' was ordered to deliver up the trust property in his hands. Cory ell having paid about $2000, in accordance with the order, in February 1843 his counsel offered to deliver to Vansant’s counsel the papers in Coryell’s possession, including the note of Coryell and Murray for $2500, and two other notes, and the stock in the Bearer Meadow Company. The counsel refused to receive them.</p>

Exceptions on part of Vansant were filed, and in December 1850, the report was set aside.</p>

An auditor was appointed, who reported that, as far as it appeared in the first account exhibited by Vansant, he appeared to be charged with all the estate <em>he </em>had received; that the Court afterwards dismissed the exceptions to it, and confirmed it. He observed, that at the time of filing it, and whilst the exceptions to it were pending, the administrator was contesting claims against the estate, and that it was necessary for him to retain the balance to meet expenses and to pay judgments as recovered. After deducting payments, the au<a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>ditor charged interest on a sum less than $400. He further expressed the opinion that the decree of the Orphans’ Court, setting aside the auditor’s report, and confirming the first account of Yansant, was examinable only <em>on appeal. </em>He thus did not charge the accountant with the note of Coryell &amp; Murray, nor with the Beaver Meadow stock. He also declined to charge him with the note of a person who was insolvent. The balance reported was less than $500.</p>

Coryell, in his account, charged the note of Coryell &amp; Murray, and his account was confirmed. That it was not received in money made no difference. It was a debt due by a firm, of which he was a member, to himself as administrator. His retention of the note was of no consequence. Under thése circumstances, Yansant should not be required to charge himself with it, — however the case might be in a suit on the administration bond, he was not chargeable in the Orphans’ Court with the balance in the hands of his co-administrator. It was in accordance with Chancery practice, in the first place to call upon the party who was primarily liable: 1 <em>W. Ser. </em>291, case of Patterson’s Estate. As related to the tender of the note, Yansant was not bound to receive anything but money; the note also was liable to the bar of the statute.</p>
