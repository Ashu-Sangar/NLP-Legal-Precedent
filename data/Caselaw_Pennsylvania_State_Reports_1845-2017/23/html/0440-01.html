The bank was a mortgagee without constructive notice, for the articles were not recorded until some months after the mortgage was duly executed and recorded. Had the bank actual notice ? The plaintiffs held the affirmative of this question, and the burden of proof was on them. The evidence produced and relied on by them was that of General Forster, the cashier of the bank in 1821. He described the negotiations which led to the <a id="p444" href="#p444" data-label="444" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*444</a>loan to Wilson and wife, and proved the letters addressed by him to Mr. Clark, as attorney of the bank, and then added, “ I heard articles of marriage settlement, between James Wilson and wife, talked of very frequently in bank and out of bank. It was before the mortgage was taken, and while they were negotiating for the loan. When spoken of in bank, it was before" the board of directors, but whether in session or individually I cannot say. I did not know the terms — it was spoken of as such a thing existing. The board did not seem to regard it as of much importance in the transaction with Wilson and wife.” On his cross-examination he stated, “ I never heard whether it was in regard to real or personal estate, or anything about it, and did not know Avho the trustees were. I merely heard there was such a thing. I cannot tell how I acquired the knowledge — it must have been from some of the directors or before the board. I, perhaps, said, on a former trial, I got the information from Jacob M. Haldeman. I say now from him or the president of the bank. Mr. Elder, the president of the bank, was a lawyer......I had no written communication with Clark and Wilson other than what is contained in the letter-book. I never mentioned to Mr. Clark the existence of the marriage settlement. I never spoke of it, that I recollect, either to him or James Wilson.”</p>

Haldeman, the only two surviving directors of 1821, that they had no knowledge of the marriage settlement when the loan was made to Wilson and wife, and Mr. Haldeman fixed the time when he first heard of it — seven or eight years afterward when he went to Carlisle to attend the sale of this property on the mortgage. <em>“ </em>Mr. Foster was then along — no sale was made at that time. I cannot say what year that was — that was the first I ever heard of this thing. I heard General Alexander speak of it at that time. General Foster was present.” General Foster being recalled by the plaintiffs, stated, “ I heard of this marriage settlement before and after the mortgage ivas executed. I got my information at Harrisburg, all that I got. I did attend sheriff’s sale of this property with Mr. Haldeman. I don’t remember anything about the conversation with Mr. Alexander spoken of by Mr. Haldeman.”</p>

Hence notice to a single corporator, is not notice to the corporation unless communicated to the board: Bank of Pittsburgh <em>v. </em>Whitehead, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%20402" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Watts 402">10 <em>Watts </em>402</a>; Custer <em>v. </em>Tomkins County Bank, 9 <em>Barr </em>27. Where a by-law, or the course and usage of business, have devolved certain duties on a particular officer of the bank, notice to him of matters relating to the routine of business intrusted to his charge, is notice to the bank, for the law presumes the directors to have employed a faithful agent, who will communicate to them what is communicated to him, and if he do not, the responsibility is on his employers.</p>
    <p id="b445-7" data-blocks='[["BL_445.5",445,[199,1181,1161,1240]],["BL_446.1",446,[316,398,1164,980]]]'>But in the negotiation of a loan of a character and upon a security so much out of the course of ordinary bank accommodations, as that made to Wilson and wife, and especially when an attorney has been employed to act for the bank, notice of an unrecorded deed communicated to the cashier could scarcely be considered notice to the bank. The correspondence of Mr. Forster shows that the <em>board </em>was deliberating and acting in regard to this loan, and that he sent such instructions, and such only, to the attorney, as the board directed. The transaction did not fall within the circle of his ordinary duties as cashier, but was peculiar and extraordinary, and he did not communicate to the board what he says he heard about the marriage articles. Under these circumstances, had he received full and explicit notice of the articles, it might be well doubted whether it could, in reason or law, be treated- as notice to the bank. But he never received such notice. He heard a marriage settlement spoken of, but who were the trustees, what was settled, whether real or personal estate, and on what terms, and Avhen made, he did not hear. Was this notice of <em>the. </em>conveyance, AA’hich had been made of the particular premises, described in the mortgage ? Obviously it was not. Nor was it sufficient to put the bank on inquiry. For, of whom could they inquire ? If of the grantors, the conveyance was denied, for the mortgage made by them Avas a solemn assertion of their ownership of the premises. Indeed it is a fair presumption from the transaction, especially from Mrs. Wilson’s joining in the mortgage, that all proper inquiries were made in that quarter, and that the title AAras represented as in her. Of the trustees, the bank could not inquire, for even Mr. Forster had not heard them mentioned. Nor was any person in possession of the premises under a title inconsistent with that <a id="p446" href="#p446" data-label="446" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*446</a>of the mortgagors. The public register was searched in vain, and no clue whatever was furnished to Mr. Eorster, by which he or the directors could come to a knowlege of the truth. Whatever puts a party on inquiry, amounts to notice, provided it would lead to the knowledge of the requisite fact, by the exercise of ordinary diligence and understanding; but evidence that it was generally reported in the neighborhood that a person had sold land to another, and that the report was communicated to the defendant, is not sufficient: Jacques <em>v. </em>Weeks, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Watts%20267" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="7 Watts 267">7 <em>Watts </em>267</a>; Epley <em>v. </em>Witherow, <em>Id. </em>167; Hood <em>v. </em>Fahnestock, 1 <em>Barr </em>470. And an intimation by one not interested in land that another title is outstanding, is not notice to a purchaser: Miller <em>v. </em>Cresson, <em>5 W. &amp; Ser. </em>It is a settled principle, said Chief Justice Gibson, in Koons <em>v. </em>Swope, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%2078" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Watts 78">2 <em>Watts </em>78</a>, that the vague reports of strangers, or information given by a person not interested in the property, are insufficient to affect a purchaser with notice. Now, a mortgagee, as well as a purchaser, is within the recording Acts, and equally entitled to notice of previous conveyances ; and if these rules be applied, it is evident from the testimony of General Foster that no person in interest ever gave him notice of the marriage articles, and that vague rumor, which was all he had, never furnished him with such facts as would have enabled the hank, with the use of ordinary diligence and understanding, to discover their relation to this land.</p>
    <p id="b446-6" data-blocks='[["BL_446.4",446,[313,1378,1157,386]]]'>In equity a purchase with notice of a secret trust is regarded as a fraud, and therefore it must be made out by clear proof of actual notice. My opinion is, said Duncan, J., in Peebles <em>v. </em>Reading, 8 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>496, that in such a case “the notice should he actual, circumstantial in the transaction,” and “ by the party in interest.” “ It must be proved that he knew exactly the state of the party having the equity, and knowing that acquired the legal estate.
