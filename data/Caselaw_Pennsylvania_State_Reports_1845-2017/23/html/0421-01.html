It did not, however, vary the effect of the record which showed the legal title to be in the plaintiff below, as executor of G-eorge Funk. Samuel, by his purchase at the executor’s sale, followed by possession and improvements, had an imperfect estate with the right to call for a conveyance upon payment of the purchase-money. This interest passed to the plaintiff in error by his purchase at the sheriff’s sale. The effect of the delay in calling for an execution of the contract upon the part of the executors, was to cast the <em>onus </em>upon the plaintiff below. After the expiration of twenty years, the law presumed the purchase-money to have been paid. This presumption in the estimation of the jury was overthrown by the evidence, which left the way open for the plaintiff to demand a specific execution of the contract.</p>
