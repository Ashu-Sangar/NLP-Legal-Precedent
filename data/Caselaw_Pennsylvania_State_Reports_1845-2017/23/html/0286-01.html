Objection was taken, but reviewers were appointed. To January Sessions they reported an extension of the street.

On the same day, on motion of counsel, and without petition, <em>alias </em>reviewers were appointed. To August Sessions the <em>alias </em>reviewers <a id="p287" href="#p287" data-label="287" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*287</a>reported the proposed extension.

That it erred in appointing reviewers on the failure of the first to report in favor of the extension; 3. In issuing the <em>alias </em>order of review without <em>petition </em>to that effect. 4. In appointing <em>alias </em>reviewers at <em>an adjourned Court, </em>the proceedings not having been continued over from the regular term. 5. That in the petitioner’s proposed extension the point of terminus was not designated with sufficient precision.</p>

If viewers will not act, or cannot agree, the proper' course is to apply to the Court to set them aside, and to appoint others, and to obtain a continuance of the order from term to term till a report is made. In this case, the order of view was returned to the office, and endorsed “filed August 6,1852; no report.” To November Sessions, 1852, the same petitioners applied for and obtained a review which reported to January Sessions, 1853, the extension of Charlotte street, as desired by the petitioners. At April Sessions, 1853, exceptions were filed, and at an adjourned Court, on 22d J une, the report was set aside, and same day <em>alias </em>reviewers were appointed, who reported to August Sessions the extension prayed for, and whose report was finally confirmed. Now, the vice of these.proceedings was at the root. There can be no review until there is a report on the road prayed for, either for or against it; and here there never was a viewer’s report. Of course the <em>alias </em>review was no better than the review, for it stands on the same foundation, and that as unsubstantial as a shadow.</p>

As the proceedings before us must be set aside, any renewed attempt to extend Charlotte street, will be made under the late legislation, and be unembarrassed by the question of jurisdiction.</p>
