No other construction of the lease bearing date on the 10th February, A. D. 1840, could properly have been given, than that it included the right to mine the coal on the whole tract. Under this lease the possession was in all of the lessees as tenants in common. If Francis J. Smith ever had the exclusive possession of any portion of the tract, or the exclusive right to take coal from any of the openings, his possession after the execution of the lease was a joint one, and his right was under the lease, and not in opposition to it. He was there as a tenant, and not as an owner. This disposes of the substantial points of the controversy. For the purposes of this trial the father’s title was perfect, the son’s good for nothing.</p>

What portion of the land in dispute was necessary for this purpose was not the subject of inquiry upon the trial. As against an intruder, where the exception is so purely technical we will presume that the possession of the soil was requisite, in order to enable the plaintiffs to avail themselves of their mining privileges. They have the right of entry for this purpose, which was denied them by the unwarrantable interference of the plaintiffs in error, and who cannot complain of injury, although dispossessed of the entire premises.</p>
