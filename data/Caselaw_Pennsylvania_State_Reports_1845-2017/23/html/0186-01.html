A part thereof, viz., $200 was paid on the execution of the agreement, and $3800 was to be paid on 1st April, 1851, when the deed was to be delivered; the residue, exceeding $4500, was to he paid in two equal payments, one on 1st April, 1852, and the other on 1st April, 1854, both to be secured by a mortgage on the land sold.</p>

The mortgage was duly recorded. For the amount of the payment previously due, viz., $3800, Kepner on the day of the delivery of the deed gave to Bock his check. The check was not paid at bank. A few days afterwards, viz., on 6th August, Kepner borrowed $2000 from H. L. Cake, and $2000 from another person, and on the same or next day, Kepner with this money took up his check. For the $2000 loaned by Cake, <a id="p187" href="#p187" data-label="187" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*187</a>Kepner gave him a judgment bond, which was entered on 8th August, 1851.

On 16th Dec. 1851, Kepner received a deed for this lot, <em>and for an adjoining lot No. </em>6. At the time of the delivery of the deed Kepner gave a judgment to the vendors for $479, being the amount of the purchase-money of the two lots, and $50 for wharfage, due to them.

The auditor reported in favor of the payment of the judgment to Huntzinger and others, the vendors, so far as it was composed of <em>purchase-money, </em>out of the proceeds of sale of lot No. 5; and further, that no title to lot No. 6 having been acquired by Kepner until the delivery of the deed to him on the 16th December, 1851, and the judgment of Huntzinger and others having been entered on the same day, it was the first lien upon the legal estate of the defendants in both of the lots, and was entitled to payment of the proceeds of sale of the two lots.</p>
