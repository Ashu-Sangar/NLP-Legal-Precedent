On the 11th May, 1830, George Ege executed a mortgage to secure to B. &amp; W. Craighead the payment of $2000 with interest from date. The mortgage was sued to April Term, 1836, and a judgment was obtained thereon, for which a <em>lev. fac. </em>was issued to January Term, 1851. A levy being made upon the life estate of George Ege, George W. Hitner, in June, 1831, was appointed sequestrator. He leased the stone house to the said George Ege for the residue of that year and for the next two years.

All the taxes assessed upon the premises for the year 1851 amounted to $52.17, and in 1852 to $50.49, and in 1853 to $24.75, in all to $127.41. These were paid by George Ege. Elizabeth Ege died on 6th December, 1848. Mrs. Sarah Miller died on the 1st of June, 1853. She received during her life, her share of the rents. During the term of the said leases, an ordinance' of the borough of Carlisle was • passed, requiring all persons, owners or occupiers of property, to pave the sidewalks in front of their houses with brick; and a notice of the ordinance was served on George Ege by the high constable, in obedience to which he had a pavement made in front of the said lot, which cost $77.61, which he paid.

This duty may be enforced by a penalty. As Ege, the tenant, was thus bound to pave the sidewalk, it was not necessary that he should await the pleasure of his landlord in this respect. As a tenant from year to year, his term was too brief to justify the Court in charging him with the expense of the improvement, while the temporary character of the work, requiring repeated renewals during a lifetime, indicated the injustice of charging it upon the remaindermen or the reversioners. <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>Such a structure is properly chargeable upon the tenant for life. Where the life estate is in the hands of a sequestrator, it is the duty of the latter to defray these charges out of the profits in the first place; but, as he is entitled to hold possession until “ all liens, and all charges for taxes, repairs, and expenses” are satisfied, the result is to charge the whole in the end upon the tenant for life.</p>
