In that case, the jurisdiction of the District Court for Philadelphia city and county was sustained. For the same reason, and upon the authority of the case, we must deny jurisdiction to the Common Pleas in the case before us. Where a claim is filed in a Court having no jurisdiction, the proper course is to order it to be stricken from the record, as it is a nullity.</p>
