    <p class="summary" id="b37-13" data-blocks='[["BL_37.11",37,[215,1689,1157,717]]]'>In 1839, the father of the appellant, living in Boston, died, having devised his real estate to his wife for life, and, upon her decease, to his nine children, as tenants in common. In 1847, the widow died, and the real estate being sold, Mrs. Nolen’s share of it amounted to $1617.68. A draft for that amount upon the Commercial Bank, Philadelphia, was drawn, payable to the order of Spencer Nolen, the husband, and it was testified that the letter containing the draft was addressed to her. The letter was received on 18th January, 1847. Nolen told his wife the money was hers. It was stated that he endorsed the draft, and that Mrs. Nolen handed it to her son to draw the money. He drew the amount and handed it to her. Her son testified that she requested him to put the money, except a small part of it, into the Farmers’ and Mechanics’ Bank for her, for safe keeping; and that he deposited it. He further said it was the understanding of his father that the money was to be kept for the separate use of his mother.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b38-7" data-blocks='[["BL_38.5",38,[304,712,1169,597]]]'>The opinion of Thompson, J., was, <em>inter alia, </em>as follows:— “ The possession and use by a husband of his wife’s money is very strong evidence of the conversion of it to his own use, and with the intent that her right to it shall be divested. This presumption arises in every case where the wife’s chose in action is reduced into the possession of the husband; but it may be repelled by sufficient proof of a different intention. It may be shown even by parol proof, that the husband has the use of his wife’s money for a limited or special purpose and with the intent to hold it in trust for her: Hinds’ Estate, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Whart.%20142" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="5 Whart. 142">5 <em>Wh. </em>142</a>. The evidence of the intent so to hold the wife’s property, must be clear and unquestionable. Subsequent admissions of the fact are entitled to but little weight; 'and the evidence of such admissions, to have any effect, must be clear, positive, and consistent: Gray’s Estate, 1 <em>Barr, </em>329. * * *</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b38-8" data-blocks='[["BL_38.6",38,[314,1303,1156,592]]]'>“ There certainly was no loan made to him (the husband) which he promised to repay, and the fact that he used the money several years prior to his death, without any question in regard to it by his wife, seems rather to indicate that it was taken into his possession with the hope of being able at some future time to return it, than any clear intent not to use it as his own. It is probable that when the money was received, the intestate had no intention of making use of it, but having it in his power he did apply it to his own use, and by so doing we think divested the right of his wife; and though Courts are always disposed to favor the claims of a wife to her choses in action, they cannot do so at the expense of creditors, unless her rights are more clearly established than they are in the present case. The report of the auditor is therefore confirmed.”</p>

A disclaimer by a husband of conversion to his own use may be established by the husband’s admissions. His reduction of her property into his possession is but evidence of his exercise of ownership. To defeat his wife’s right of survivorship, he must do some act, in reference to her chose in action, which is of a possessory character, and with the design of asserting his right of possession: 1 <em>Barr </em>328; 2 <em>Id. </em>71.</p>
