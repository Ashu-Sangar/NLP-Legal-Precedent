On the part of the latter it was contended, before the auditor, that Henry Shearer, the executor, was necessarily trustee of the specific legacy of ¿6400, to put it to interest for the use of Nancy Kendrick during her life, and pay the principal to her children after her death. It was alleged that Henry Shearer received sufficient assets to pay the ¿6400; and having received it, the children of Nancy Kendrick should be referred to his estate, and not to the money in the hands of the administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>which it was alleged on their part had been raised out of the remainder of the estate of Henry Rush, the testator, and should b,e paid to those who were entitled to the remainder of his estate.</p>

He observed, that if the fund in the hands of Sarah Haines, as administratrix of the estate of <em>Henry Share, </em>be part of the estate of Henry Rush, there could be no injury done by appropriating the balance in the hands of Jacob Fehl to the specific legacy; for when that is paid or provided for, the other fund becomes a part of the residuum of his estate for distribution among the residuary legatees.

His neglect to file an account cannot prejudice the appellees. They are not claiming <em>the interest, </em>but the principal of the fund ; and claim it out of the first available funds.

Though in 1852, about 41 years after the filing of the inventory on the estate of Henry Rush, an administration on the estate of a <em>Henry Share </em>exhibited a fund, the specific legatees were not bound to look to it.

In the latter case it has been held that the surplus, after payment of debts and particular legacies, is as much a legacy as any other, and that the residuary legatee has a right to call for an equalization of the loss by abatement. According to Dyose <em>v. </em>Dyose, 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>305, the loss in such case falls <em>pari passu </em>upon each. A residuary legatee is not less the object of the testator’s bounty than other legatees. On the contrary, the intention is, generally, to give him <em>more </em>instead of <em>less </em>than the others, and it would rarely accord with that- intention to throw upon him exclusively all the losses arising from the misfortunes or misconduct of the common trustee. Where there is no loss arising from these causes, but a mere deficiency of assets, it is a necessary result that he cannot call for an abatement. He gets the residue, whether it be more or less, and he can claim no more. In this case, there is no evidence that the assets were wasted by the executor. On the contrary, there is a balance of $&gt;1900.38 in the hands of his administratrix <em>de bonis non, </em>&amp;c. If any portion of this fund belonged to the estate of Henry Rush, it was the duty of the administrator <em>de bonis non, </em>&amp;c., of that estate, to collect it, sect.. 31, Act 24th February, 1834. The presumption is that he has done his duty in this respect, and that the balance in his hands is all that remains of the personal estate after payment of debts. This is the only fund before us for distribution, and the appellees have a right to their legacy out of it. Conceding that there is another fund in the hands of Henry Share’s representative, out of which they might obtain satisfaction, would not better the case of the appellants. The appellees are not bound to resor-t to it.</p>
