Brenneman <em>v. </em>John E. Shroder, for the improper use of or interference with an alley along which the plaintiff had a right of passage. The alley was six feet in width, extending along the property of the plaintiff up to and along a property of Shroder’s, the defendant, at the head of the alley, as to which property Shroder had the right of way along the alley. This property Shroder had purchased from John Metzgar. But Shroder had another property lower down the alley, bordering on it, and along which the alley run at right angles to its other course, to which the alley was not appurtenant. The property last referred to he had purchased from <em>Withers. </em>Shroder placed a hydrant in the alley along the side of the latter property, and close to the line of it, and had a gate <a id="p349" href="#p349" data-label="349" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*349</a>put in the side of such lot near to the hydrant. It was alleged, on liis part, that the hydrant did not obstruct the passage. It was for the use of the alley in connexion with the latter lot for which the action was brought. Tne plea was not guilty.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b349-6" data-blocks='[["BL_349.4",349,[206,576,1166,636]]]'>On the trial it was offered to be proved, on the part of <em>the defendant, </em>that the hydrant was put there by the authority of the city; that the defendant had a permit to locate it in the way it was; also that where the hydrant stands there was a structure, and that, until three years last past, there was no gate leading from the alley into Brenneman’s yard, except one near to the mouth of the alley; also for the purpose of showing that the erection of the hydrant was not an obstruction of the right of way, it was offered to prove that the ground on which the hydrant stands, was not used as a right of way, but for 45 years or upwards was occupied by buildings or structures whose existence was inconsistent with a right of way. Also offered to ask a witness whether the hydrant, as it stands against Shroder’s wall, interferes with or obstructs in any way the passage along the alley. Such testimony or evidence was overruled.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b349-8" data-blocks='[["BL_349.6",349,[200,1264,1172,1118]]]'>Long, J., charged the jury that where two or more persons have a right of way or passage, each of them must so use that right, as not to interfere with the proper enjoyment of the rights of others; and any interference with that privilege, no matter how small, will give to the party whose right is interfered with, a cause of action. If therefore the defendant had no right by the grant under which he holds to erect such <em>a hydrant, </em>he could not do so, without the consent of the other persons who have a right of way to this alley. With regard to the door or opening, which was made into the wall of the defendant, and which communicates into the alley, the door has an entrance into premises which is not entitled to participate in the enjoyment of the alley. The mere erection of this door, or making an opening into the wall, would not entitle the plaintiff to an action; but if the defendant or his servants, or persons in his employ living in those premises made use of this right of way, then an action would lie by any person whose right was interfered with; and as the plaintiff, in conjunction with others, has a right of way to the alley, he would have a right of action if there has been intrusion upon it by the defendant, or persons in his employ. It is true, that the defendant has other property lying within the range of the alley, to which the right of way through it is incidental; but the right annexed to those lots, would not extend the right to this lot although it lies alongside of the alley, for this would be changing the rights of the parties to the original grant, and those under whom they claim, and introducing persons who have no right to participate in its use.</p>

Entitled to the use of this alley for the purposes of the lot purchased of Metzgar, if Shroder can use it also for the convenience of the lot he purchased from Withers, there is nothing to prevent his use of it in connexion with any other lots he may purchase along the alley, and thus Brenneman may be annoyed with the general use of a right granted only for a special purpose. The right is not <em>personal </em>to Schroder, but appurtenant to his one specific lot, and the necessary limitation of its extent is found in the terms of the grant. It cannot be carried beyond, without invading the reserved rights of the grantor, for which <em>case </em>is the appropriate remedy.</p>
