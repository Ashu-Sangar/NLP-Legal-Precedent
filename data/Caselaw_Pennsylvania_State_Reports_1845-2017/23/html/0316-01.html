    <p class="summary" id="b316-15" data-blocks='[["BL_316.14",316,[270,1549,1175,341]]]'>Bland and Umstead were adjoining owners of land, and in 1844 they entered into a written agreement under seal, for the maintenance of a partition fence, each agreeing to maintain a specified half. In 1851 the part which Bland had contracted to keep up was swept away by a flood in the river Schuylkill, and, he being dead, Umstead gave notice to his administrators to restore it, which they neglected to do, and Umstead did it himself, and claimed to charge them for the expense.</p>

The overruling of this offer involved the whole principle of the case.</p>

Neither of the parties binds his executor or administrator in the covenant; and if he had attempted it, we do not see very well how he could have succeeded. If the administrator is bound now, he must be hound in all time to come; but the law does not profess to keep up the representation of a dead man’s estate longer than is necessary to settle it.</p>

This is a contract intended to regulate the relation of adjoining owners, and it is involved in its very nature that it cannot last longer than the relation. We see no word indicating that it was for any other purpose, and we should misapply it entirely if we should treat it as a rule of duty for persons not standing in the contemplated relation.</p>
