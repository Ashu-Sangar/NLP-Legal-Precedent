The Court was asked to charge, that “ the plaintiff having failed to prove a demand on the defendants, he cannot recover.” The judge refused to charge the jury, that a demand was necessary, but charged to the contrary, reserving the questions for the consideration of the Court, which subsequently gave judgment for the plaintiff, upon the verdict.</p>

The case of Wingate <em>v. </em>The Mechanics’ Bank, 10 <em>Barr </em>104, was referred to as sustaining this decision. The rule for a new trial was discharged, and judgment rendered for plaintiff.

If the defendants were liable without demand, because they did not seek the depositor and pay him, so a bank must be liable for the proceeds of notes deposited without a previous demand. The allegation was that the defendants undertook to collect the draft and pay the amount to the plaintiff, and had <em>refused </em>to collect it; but of such refusal, it was said that no proof was given at the trial. An attorney is not liable to his client for money collected until after demand made, unless there be special circumstances dispensing with the necessity therefor. In this case the custom was to present receipts and demand payment. The case of Johnson <em>v. </em>Farmers’ Bank, <a href="/del/1/0117-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 W.W.

It is not applicable to banks. In the case of Wingate <em>v. </em>The Bank, it was disputed whether any charge was made for collection, except to cover expenses; in this case the charge for service is not disputed. The law implies a promise from brokers and other agents for hire, that they will exercise proper skill and care in their respective callings. In this case, if the defendants did not make the collection in a reasonable time, they should have given notice to the plaintiff and returned the note, or put it in his power: <em>Lex Mercatoria </em>41; <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Rawle%20229" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="4 Rawle 229">4 <em>Rawle </em>229</a>; <em>Id. </em>392; 4 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>306; 6 <em>Id. </em>416; 5 <em>Harris </em>322.</p>
