To avoid the statute, a letter, alleged to have been written by defendant, was offered, elated July 6, 1846. It was objected to ; and to prove the handwriting in it, a witness testified that he never saw Daniel Shitler write; <em>“ </em>I have seen his writing; I have seen order’s signed by him, that children brought to me as teacher, when he was a school director; there is a general resemblance to his handwriting. This looks like it — resembles it — can’t say I believe it to be his writing, for there is a possibility of mistake.”</p>

The suit was brought to recover for goods sold eleven years before its commencement. The defendants plead the statute, and the admission contained in the letter was simply that he was indebted to the plaintiff, coupled with a promise to pay “ some in two months, and all before long, with interest from April, 1846.” The letter wras dated, in July, 1846. Now, without attempting a review of the decisions made by our predecessors, upon the requisites to avoid the bar of the statute of <a id="p415" href="#p415" data-label="415" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*415</a>limitations, it is sufficient to say, that we have recently held, in an unreported case,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> that a naked admission of indebtedness, without in any way indicating the amount or nature of the debt, or a promise to pay something without any reference to the sum to be paid, or what it is to be paid for, is no answer to the plea of the statute. Here the letter relied upon as a promise to pay, and admission of a debt due, was entirely silent as to how much was due, what sum would be paid, or what was the character of the debt — whether one, or $1000; due for land or goods; founded upon a contract with or without a consideration.</p>
