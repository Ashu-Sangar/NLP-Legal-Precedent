The plaintiff had sent his son on an errand, and whilst riding on the mare he met the defendants in a buggy. The defendants continued in the road, and, whilst passing, the leg of the animal was struck and injured. It was said that the body of the mare, except the leg which was struck, was outside of the wagon track, on the foot path; and it was alleged that the defendants could have turned aside sufficiently to have avoided a collision. The mare was turned out on the side which was usual, and a log lay within eighteen inches of the wagon track on the side to which the mare was turned.</p>

The enjoyment of this right is regulated by reason. A footman or horseman cannot compel a teamster, who has a heavy draught, to leave the smooth beaten track of the road, if there is sufficient room to pass on either side. And where a road is narrow, or there is difficulty in passing, and it becomes impracticable or dangerous for the teamster to give part of the way, and the horseman ean pass by riding out of the road, it is his duty to do so. If he refuses, and a collision ensues which occasions injury to his horse, it is attributable to his own negligence or obstinacy, and he is without remedy. So if the collision is entirely accidental, resulting from the vicious conduct of the animal which he rides, whether induced by fright or any other cause.” Ho further observed, that if the injury was “the result of accident” no blame could attach to the defendants, and they could not be <a id="p197" href="#p197" data-label="197" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*197</a>held liable “ to pay damages for an act whieh was not caused by them.”</p>

We think not. The illustration was fairly put, and it was not inapplicable to a buggy laden with three men and drawn by a single horse. In regard to such a buggy, no less than in reference to a teamster with heavy draught, the law unquestionably is that a footman or a horseman has no right to force it out of the beaten track of the road if there b.e sufficient room to pass on either side. And where a road is narrow, and there is difficulty in passing, if the horseman can turn out without danger to himself or beast, and the buggy cannot be turned out without incurring danger, it is the duty of the former to give way. This was the doctrine which the jury must have deduced from the charge, and in this there was no misleading.</p>

The whole tenor of the charge conveys this idea, and in such teaching there was no error. For inevitable accidents and for such as result from mutual negligence of parties, the law gives no redress, but when the injury comes from the exclusive negligence of one party, he cannot shield himself from calling it an accident.
