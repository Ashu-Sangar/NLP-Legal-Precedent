Wilson. A. M. Magill leased to Wilson certain premises for one year, commencing on 1st April, 1853. The rent was to be $250 for the year, payable quarterly <em>in advance. </em>The first quarter’s rent, due on 1st April, was paid when possession was taken. Under Purdy’s execution a levy was made on 9th June. The writ was returnable to <a id="p98" href="#p98" data-label="98" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*98</a>September Term. The property ivas sold in <em>June. </em>After the sale, but before the return-day of the writ, the landlord gave notice to the sheriff that he claimed one quarter’s rent (viz. the quarter’s rent payable in advance on 1st of July), out of the proceeds of sale. The money was considered in Court.</p>

By the Act of 16th June, 1836, goods liable to distress shall be liable <em>“ </em>for the payment of any sums of money <em>due </em>for rent at the time of taking such goods in execution.” The construction that <em>the growing rent </em>may be apportioned till the time of levy, though the day of payment of it had not arrived, is not a decision when no rent is growing due and when the levy is made during a period for which the rent had been paid, that the landlord is entitled to rent for <em>a future period </em>out of the proceeds of sale. In Anderson’s Appeal, the Court apportioned the rent in an unusual manner on the basis of a fiction, on account of the peculiar equity which the landlord had in that case, from the fact, that the profitable part of the season had nearly passed when the goods of .the tenant were levied upon. But the rent had not been paid for that portion of the term when the levy took place, as it had been in this case.</p>
