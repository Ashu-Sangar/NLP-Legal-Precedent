Klett &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>The Delaware Mutual Insurance Company, to recover for a partial loss, over 20 per cent, on 15 bales of pinkroot, consigned to the plaintiff, and which was injured by dangers of the sea, other than stranding. The policy contained the usual memorandum clause, by which it was agreed that certain kinds of property, including “ <em>vegetables and roots, prepared or otherwise; </em>rags, hempen yarn, &amp;c., <em>and all articles perishable in their own nature, </em>are warranted by the assured free from average (except general), unless it happen by stranding, and amount to 20 per cent, on the whole aggregate value of such articles,” &amp;c.</p>

Sarsaparilla is not a root perishable in its nature: 7 <em>T. R. </em>385-6; also, 2 <em>Arnould </em>851-2. The judge, in confining the plaintiffs to proof of a usage or understanding in respect to the particular article of pinkroot, was too strict. It was said that shipments of pinkroot were not sufficiently frequent to afford any usage or custom in relation to it particularly. The offer was to prove that pinkroot was an article of commerce dried and prepared, not perishable in its nature, and therefore not within the memorandum clause: also, that it was deprived of all germinating qualities, and in no way succulent or perishable, and therefore did not come within the meaning of the word “ roots,” by which, it was said, was to be understood either the parts of the plants designed to supply the stems with nourishment, or juicy and esculent, such as beets, &amp;c.: <em>McCulloch’s Dictionary </em>as to <em>Madder. </em>The term “skins and hides” held not to include “bear skins” covered with fur: 7 <em>Cowen </em>202, 207; 6 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>279.</p>

The plaintiff would have been permitted to show that pinkroot was not a root within the meaning of the memorandum clause, as established by mercantile custom, and so understood by underwriters. It was not so shown. But if it were proper, according to 2 <em>Arnould </em>851—2, to prove that the term “roots,” standing alone, may mean only <em>esculent roots, </em>it may have been going too far to have allowed the plaintiffs to show that <em>prepared roots </em>do not mean <em>dried roots, </em>contrary to the language of the policy. But the first witness knew of only one case of claim made, and that was compromised; and the knowledge of the second was limited to that case and this one; and the third witness knew of no other case where a dispute arose on the subject. The terms “hides and skins” do not include “furs:” 7 <em>Cowen </em>202; but “skins” includes “deer skins:” 2 <em>Johns. Cases </em>246. Fruit includes “dried prunes:” 1 <em>Brevard </em>437. The terms used in a policy are to be understood in their ordinary and popular sense, unless, in respect to the subject-matter, they have generally, as by the known usage of trade or the like, acquired a peculiar sense distinct from the popular sense of the words: 4 <em>East </em>135; also, 2 <em>Phillips on Ins. </em>449-51.</p>
