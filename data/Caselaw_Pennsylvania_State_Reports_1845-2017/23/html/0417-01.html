Upon evidence on the one side tending to prove the existence, and, upon the other, the 'nonexistence of said sub-district, the Common Pleas instructed the jury, — “ That if, prior to the Act of 21st March, 1853, there was a sub-district in East Pennsborough township known and recognised as the Walnut Grove school district or sub-district, of known, determinate, and fixed boundaries, capable of being ascertained, and pointed out without difficulty or mistake, then the Act referred to would not be inoperative and void, but would authorize the election of school directors, and the organization of the Walnut Grove district for school purposes, and the present defendants <a id="p420" href="#p420" data-label="420" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*420</a>could hold and exercise the functions of school directors in the district thus organized.”</p>

Until the boundaries are ascertained and recorded, the sub-district is not in existence. If the minutes of the board did not show a sub-district, known as the “Walnut Grove district,” there was none, and it was error to receive parol evidence to prove the existence of what could have no real or legal existence.</p>

In other words, that the whole of said sub-district and no more, was to comprise the mew district. Unless this can be adopted as the correct construction of the Act, there is neither accuracy nor precision in the description. If the words, “ now embraced in the Walnut Grove school district,” are to be considered in an unqualified sense, then of course all the territory within said district is included; but the Act reads “ the parts adjacent the Pine Grove School-house, now embraced,” &amp;c. Here then are two matters of description, and we are not justified in excluding either. 1st, The territory must be adjacent to the Pine Grove School-house; and 2d, It must be embraced in the Walnut Grove school district. As well might it be said that everything was included which was adjacent to the Pine Grove School-house, whether embraced in the Walnut Grove school district or not, as to say that all that was so embraced was to be taken, whether adjacent. to the school-house or otherwise.- Again, to confine the description to the Walnut Grove school district, we have the legislative absurdity of making a new district out of the precise territory of an old one. The Act would read thus: “ That the parts now embraced in the Walnut Grove school district, shall be erected into a separate school district,” &amp;c. Our respect for the legislative department of our state government, forbids that we should take such liberties with their enactments, particularly as by it we convict them of doing not only a useless, but a foolish Act.</p>
