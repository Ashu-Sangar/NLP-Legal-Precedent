As his testimony in chief is not set forth in the bill of exceptions, nor in any other part of the paper-book, we cannot say there was error in the manner of impeaching it. Every presumption is in favor of the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas.</p>
    <p id="b521-4" data-blocks='[["BL_521.4",521,[203,790,1160,472]]]'>The errors complained of in the 4th and 5th assignments are, in the argument, reduced to the question whether there was such property in Snyder, the plaintiff, as would enable him to maintain this action. We think this question was properly disposed of by the Court below. The evidence tended to show that Long and Wagner were the agents of Snyder, for the purchase of the grain from which the flour was made, and that it was bought for him and paid for with his money. There was no evidence that the 100 bushels referred to in the defendants’ second point were purchased for any other person than Snyder. The instructions to the jury and the answers to the points were correct.</p>
