Young, for a span of sorrel horses. Kimball was an innkeeper, in Wellsboro’, Tioga county. Young, the defendant in the <em>replevin, </em>was a contractor for carrying the mail twice a week between Wellsboro’ and Coudersport in Potter county. He sub-let the contract to Cornelius Culp. Culp testified that lie made an arrangement with Kimball to board him, and give him barn-room for horses, grain and hay, at a stipulated sum per week. He took care of the team himself. In part he found his own hay and oats. Had no contract with Kimball for the feed he bought of him. The arrangement was made with Kimball about the 1st of July, 1848. The two teams and driver of Culp were kept in part at Kimball’s until about the middle of December next following, when both of the teams were sold under execution against Culp, one, a sorrel team, being sold in Coudersport on the 16th December, and the other, a black team, was sold in Wellsboro’ on the 20th December. One of the teams usually ran on the east end of the route; and the other, the sorrel team, the one in controversy, usually ran on the west end of the route. Sometimes they were changed.</p>
