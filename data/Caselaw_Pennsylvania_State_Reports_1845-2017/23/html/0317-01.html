As to the meaning of the terms “next of kin” or “nearest of kindred,” reference was made to 2 <em>Jarman </em>30-39. In this case <em>Samuel </em>answered all the requisites of the description; the property, therefore, vested in him. What estate had he? The words “next male heir” and “nearest of kin to me,” were intended evidently to indicate the first taker, and not to qualify the estate. If a female, equally, near of kin with Samuel, had succeeded him, she was to be excluded. The subsequent words show that it was to go to the heirs of the male line — not to the male heirs of that line, as contended for by the defendant in error. The usual words of inheritance are not here; nevertheless, apt words to convey a fee simple are used. If. <a id="p319" href="#p319" data-label="319" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*319</a>the testator had said, I give it to the “male heir nearest of kin” at the time of my death, and to the heirs of that line, it would have meant the same as the present will, and would have given a fee simple to the first taker. The meaning of the words succession or successors must control this estate. The testator in effect says: “ I give and allow the plantation to whomsoever may be my next male heir at the time of my death, and to his successors.” Successors is the same as heirs, and creates a fee simple: 8 <em>Viner 206; Id. </em>209. The whole scope and words of the will show that the estate was to vest in the person answering the description of next male heir, and then to descend to his heirs. It is therefore a fee simple, and judgment should be entered for the defendant below.</p>

It is difficult to give a more correct description of an estate tail than by speaking of it as vesting iu the male heir, and passing on in succession on that line. The expression “ on that line” is a phrase of restraining import; used to impose a precise limit to the previous general expression of male heir. It was in conclusion intimated that an intention was manifested in the devise to limit the estate to the issue of the first taker.</p>

That rule should be observed with more strictness here than in England, .because our laws of inheritance are more equal: <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Binn.%2020" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Binn. 20">2 <em>Bin. </em>20</a>. “Entailments are recommended in monarchical governments as a protection to the power and influence of the landed aristocracy ; but such a policy has no application to republican establishments, where wealth does not form a permanent distinction, and under which every individual of every family has his equal rights and is equally invited by the genius of the institutions to depend upon his own merit and exertions4 <em>Kent </em>20. As the rules of descent established by law are presumed to be founded on w'isdom, and as the policy of the law stands opposed to entailments, the remainderman must be deemed seised in fee simple, unless we are forced by the clear language of the will to give it some other construction. Words of procreation are as necessary to the creation of an estate tail as words of inheritance are to a fee simple: 2 <em>Bl. Com. </em>114. Rut we have no words of procreation here. Even the. words which designate the first taker after the life estate, do not necessarily import that he must be one of the heirs of the testator’s body. He may be his “next male heir nearest in kindred” without being lineally descended from him. The words “ so on- in succession on that line” do not therefore necessarily mean that the estate shall go to the heirs of the body of the devisee. The words “according to law” are not to be rejected in the construction of this will. It is true that the testator may have meant that the law is to be regarded in ascertaining who is his next male heir nearest in kindred and relation to him; but he may also have meant that the estate shall come to him, in the same manner that the law would Lave given it to the heirs of the testator. We adopt this as the true meaning.. The words “ on that line” do not necessarily mean the male issue of the devisee, but simply his heirs as contradistinguished from the heirs of the tenant of the life estate previously given. If we created an estate tail by construction in this case, we must do it not only without words of procreation, but without any words which can supply their place. If the succession is not to be regulated according to law, but must be governed by the description given to designate the first taker after the life estate, the result would be inconvenient, and, as we think, contrary to the testator’s intent. Upon the death of every tenant it would be necessary to ascertain, not only his male heir, but the malé heir nearest in kindred and relation to the testator. This, in process of time, would become impossible. And yet this is the line we should be compelled to seek for if we departed from the <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>rules of descent established by law. An estate tail is so readily docked, that we are not willing to suppose the testator had such an unimportant object in view, where his will does not clearly express it. We are of opinion that Samuel McIntyre, the son of the testator, was seised in fee simple of the remainder, and that the plaintiff in error is therefore entitled to judgment on the case stated.</p>
