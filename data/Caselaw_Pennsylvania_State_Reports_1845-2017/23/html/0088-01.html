The arrears till 1835, were stated at $450; taxes were deducted, and the balance was $380.83, which amount, by a paper of October 17th, 1835, signed by the three parties, it was stated, was left in the hands of See and Remington, “who assume the payment thereof.” In the declaration was contained several of the common counts in actions of <em>assumpsit, </em>including one for money had and received^ <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>and also a special count.

It would seem to be a clear dictate of natural justice that such a plaintiff should be permitted to recover; but in this case he was not, and we are now to look into the reasons assigned for denying him a verdict.</p>

Whilst that remained outstanding, there was the same reason for See and Remington retaining the f&gt;380.83, that there was for leaving it with them on the 17th October, 1835, and therefore Evans could not sue for it; and because he could not sue for it, the statute did not begin to run against him. But as soon as the ground-rent was paid, this sum of money was loosed, and became demandable by action, and then the statute began to run. Within less than a year, however, after this, the action was brought, so that as to the common counts of the plaintiff’s <em>narr. </em>the statute was no bar.</p>

The question was founded on the assumption that Wain was the party entitled to receive the ground-rent, for had there been any doubt on this point, it would have been submitted to the jury.</p>

The question here is, whether the payment of the ground-rent did not release the fund pledged as indemnity against it. We think it did. The payment of the 23d December, 1851, extinguished the ground-rent, and the lien of it was gone for ever. The owner of it, being satisfied, could never assert it against the premises sold by Evans to the defendants. If Wain had forgiven it, cancelled it without consideration, or if it had been paid off by a mere stranger, it could not longer encumber the premises or be set up against the plaintiff’s action. But Evans was not a mere stranger or volunteer. If not strictly liable for the ground-rent, he had such an interest in its extinguishment as entitled'him to pay it. He was sued for it, and its removal was indispensable to the closing of his contract of sale.' Instead of resisting Wain’s right to recover from him, he chose to remove the only obstacle in the way of his recovering the balance of his purchase-money from this defendant, and he had a right to do so. The payment was well made by him, made to the proper party, and could not be disaffirmed or recovered back by him, nor <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>impeached by others. From that moment the money in the defendants’ hands belonged, <em>ex cequo et bono, </em>to the plaintiff, and the action, as to the common counts, was brought in good time for its recovery.</p>
