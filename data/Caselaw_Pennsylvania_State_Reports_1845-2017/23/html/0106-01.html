    <p id="b109-11" data-blocks='[["BL_109.11",109,[223,1439,1167,773]]]'>The Common Pleas instructed the jury that “under the contract between the parties, the defendant has no right to swell, either in high or low water, above the height of the rock therein referred to; and if he has done so, he will be liable to the plaintiff in this action.” In this we think there was error. It was the flow of the water, except in an extraordinary rise, which the parties had in contemplation when the contract was made. During the continuance of the lease, the defendant is to be considered as the owner of the land, so far as the right to flood it with water is concerned. Eor an injury occasioned by an extraordinary rise in the stream he cannot be held responsible. If the water, except as above mentioned, was kept within the limits expressed in the lease, the defendant was only exercising his lawful rights, secured to him by the contract itself; a necessary consequence resulting from which, would be that, at unusual stages, the water would be thrown upon lands without the limitation. To make the lessee responsible for this, would deprive him of the full enjoyment of the right or privilege demised.</p>
