    <p id="b429-6" data-blocks='[["BL_429.4",429,[208,495,1167,1413]]]'>The defendant offered upon the trial to show his general character, that it was uniformly good, and that he was reputed to .be a peaceable and orderly person, for the purpose of rebutting any inference of malice. This was objected to and rejected. The question thus presented is by no means a new one. , Many cases in which the principle is involved are to be found in the English reports, and in those of the different states of this Union. The decisions have not been in entire conformity with each other, but the weight of authority is largely in favor of the rule as pronounced by the Court below. The Attorney-General <em>v. </em>Bowman, 2 <em>Bosanquet &amp; Puller </em>532, note A, is the leading English case. This was an information against the defendant for keeping false weights. It was proposed to give evidence of his general good character, but it was held to be inadmissible, Chief Baron Eyre observing that “ the offence imputed is not in the shape of a crime.” It would be contrary to the true line of distinction to admit it, which is this, that, in a direct prosecution for a crime, such evidence is admissible, but where the prosecution is not directly for the crime but for the penalty, it is not. In Goodright <em>v. </em>Hicks, cited in <em>Buller’s N. P. </em>296, which was an action of ejectment by an heir at law, to set aside a will for fraud and imposition committed by the defendant, it was held that witnesses could not be examined as to defendant’s good character. Humphreys <em>v. </em>Humphreys, 7 <em>Conn. Rep., </em>was an issue upon the adultery of the wife, and the proof, merely presumptive evidence of her good character, was refused: Woodruff <em>v. </em>Whittelsey, <a href="/kirby/1/0060-01" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="1 Kirby 60" data-case-ids="11137581" data-case-paths="/kirby/1/0060-01">1 <em>Kirby </em>60</a>. Trover for goods, where fraud upon creditors by a colorable bill of sale was in question, and the evidence circumstantial, the general character of the parties to the bill for honesty was refused. In Fowler <em>v. </em>Etna Fire Insurance Co., 6 <em>Cowen </em>473, a fraudulent valuation of loss at a fire was imputed to plaintiffs, which involved moral perjury at least, it was ruled that evidence of his good character was improperly received.</p>

Upon the trial evidence was received that the defendant sustained a good character for honesty and fair dealing. The judges of -the Supreme Court were unanimously of opinion that this evidence was inadmissible; admitting that the contrary had been decided in Ruan <em>v. </em>Perry, 3. <em>Caines </em>120, but overruling it in terms. In Givens <em>v. </em>Bradley, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Bibb%20195" class="citation" data-index="23" data-cite="3 Bibb 195">3 <em>Bibb </em>195</a>, evidence of the plaintiff’s character was refused, although the action was assault and battery; and in Rogers <em>v. </em>Lamb, 3 <em>Blackford </em>155, which was case for malicious prosecution, it was held that the defendant’s character was not in issue, and that he could not call <a id="p430" href="#p430" data-label="430" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*430</a>witnesses to support it. In our own state evidence of the defendant’s good character was rejected in Nash <em>v. </em>Gilkeson, 5 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>352, although fraud was imputed to him by the evidence given by the plaintiffs. And in Anderson <em>v. </em>Long, 10 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>55, the plaintiff was refused permission to show his good character for honesty, although the defence ivas that he had fraudulently obtained the bond upon which the suit was brought.</p>
    <p id="b430-6" data-blocks='[["BL_430.4",430,[307,701,1158,130]]]'>The principles upon which these decisions rest, are 1st, That in civil suits evidence of the character of the parties, except where the character is directly in issue, is not admissible.</p>
    <p id="b430-7" data-blocks='[["BL_430.5",430,[307,830,1160,470]]]'>2d. That putting character in issue is a technical expression, which does not mean simply that the character may be affected by the result, but that it is of particular importance in the suit itself, as the character of the plaintiff in an action of slander, or that of a woman in an action on the case for seduction. The remark of Professor Greenleaf, in his Treatise on Evidence, vol. 1st, sect. 54, that “ generally in actions of tort, wherever the defendant is charged with fraud from mere circumstances, evidence of his general good character is admissible to repel- it,” is not sustained by any authority which I can find, save Ruan <em>v. </em>Perry, 3 <em>Caines, </em>and this is expressly overruled in 16 Wendell, before referred to.</p>
    <p id="b430-8" data-blocks='[["BL_430.6",430,[307,1301,1159,545]]]'>It is admitted that the defendant’s good character would have been legitimate evidence in his favor, upon the trial of an indictment for the assault and battery with which he was charged, and it is somewhat difficult to perceive why it should be received in the one case and excluded in the other; but such, as we have shown, is the well settled rule of law, and, unless it is manifestly wrong, ought not to be disturbed. It does not follow because it is not in consonance with the rule in criminal evidence, that it is therefore clearly wrong. To exclude evidence of character in all civil actions where character is not directly in issue, makes the result depend rather upon the character of the circumstances attendant upon the transaction than upon that of the parties, or either of them.</p>
    <p id="b430-9" data-blocks='[["BL_430.7",430,[309,1854,1159,559]],["BL_431.1",431,[202,401,1157,431]]]'>In the very able argument made by the counsel for the plaintiff in error, it is contended that where the action is to recover damages for an injury committed against the person by force, alleging a malicious intention upon the part of the defendant, and where the evidence is conflicting, character should be received. There is no such distinction or exception as this to be found in any of the authoritative cases. It is not the consequences to be apprehended from the result that puts the character in issue, but the nature of the issue itself. To use the language of Justice Daggett, in Humphrey <em>v. </em>Humphrey, (<a href="/conn/7/0116-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="7 Conn. 116" data-case-ids="6753326" data-case-paths="/conn/7/0116-01">7 <em>Conn. </em>116</a>), “ Causes charging cruelty, and even forgery, are often agitated in suits by individuals; and the result not unfrequently affects the property and reputation of the party deeply; yet no individual has been permitted to attempt to repel <a id="p431" href="#p431" data-label="431" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*431</a>the proof by showing a good reputation.” It would be no rule at all if it were to be enforced or set aside according to the extent of the disaster to be apprehended from an unfavorable result. Again: were we to determine that whenever the evidence imputed a criminal act to the defendant for which he might be indicted, he should have the advantage of his good character, we should be utterly disregarding the rule of <em>stare decisis; </em>which ought never to be done, except where an adherence to the beaten track is certain to produce the most mischievous results. There was no error committed in rejecting evidence of the defendant’s good character.</p>
    <p id="b431-6" data-blocks='[["BL_431.4",431,[201,832,1161,944]]]'>An indictment was preferred in the Quarter Sessions of Dauphin county against the defendant, for an assault and battery with intent to commit murder, and for an assault and battery. He was found guilty upon the charge of assault and battery, but not guilty of the intent to kill. The sentence "was to pay a fine of one hundred dollars and costs. This record was offered in evidence by the defendant, and received without objection. The learned judge instructed the jury “ that this record, when given in evidence by the defendant, was strong evidence that an assault and battery was committed,” and further, that he “ did not consider it by any means conclusive that Porter did not stab Seiler, for it would be the duty of the jury to acquit on the two first counts, if they believed the knife was drawn and used after the fight commenced and the blood became heated, as killing in such cases would not have amounted to murder, but would at most have been manslaughter. Yet that by no means shelters the defendant from his civil responsibility for the injury done.” It is assigned for error that the Court erred in charging that the record was strong evidence “ that an assault and battery was committed.” That “ it was not conclusive that Porter did not stab Seiler,” and in further charging “ yet that by no means shelters the defendant from his civil responsibility for the injury done.”</p>
    <p id="b431-7" data-blocks='[["BL_431.5",431,[199,1776,1162,643]]]'>It must be remembered that this record was offered by <em>the defendant, </em>and, as appears from what was said by the judge, for the double purpose of showing the punishment already received, and of disproving the intention to kill. It certainly could not have been offered by the plaintiff for any purpose; but when voluntarily given by the defendant, and admitted without objection by the plaintiff, and without its effect being restricted in any manner, was it not evidence that the assault and battery had been committed ? It was offered and received generally, and it contained the verdict of guilty of an assault and battery, with the sentence of the Court thereupon; and if evidence to disprove the intention to kill, it was evidence to verify the assault. Had it been offered specially in mitigation of damages by the defendant, I will not say that it should have been allowed any other effect; but, from the course pursued, it would seem that both parties were willing that it should</p>

The judge was right in saying that an acquittal upon the two first counts in the indictment did not conclusively disprove the stabbing, for the reason given in the charge. A misconstruction is placed upon the last clause in the assignment of error. Its true meaning is simply that the absence of the intention to kill by no means shelters the defendant from his civil responsibility for the injury done.</p>
