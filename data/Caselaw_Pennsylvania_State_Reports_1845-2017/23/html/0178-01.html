As to the falsity, it may be by the positive statement of a falsehood, or by the suppression of material facts which the other party ought to know. It is not necessary that there should be collusion between the defendant and the person recommended — nor that either intended to defraud the party inquiring. It is sufficient if such has been the effect of the representation. Representations of such a character -are fre<a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>quently made from inconsiderateness, without a design of advancing the interest of the party making them. <em>The motives </em>of sucls party are not to be considered, if he made representations productive of loss to another, knowing the representations to be false; or if he has suppressed material facts within his knowledge, he is responsible as for a fraudulent deceit. The question for the jury is one of <em>good faith, </em>and if they believe that the defendant <em>believed </em>his own statement, they should find in his favor.
