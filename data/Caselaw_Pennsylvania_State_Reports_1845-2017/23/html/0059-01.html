Dale, a native of Philadelphia, and a bachelor, having lived several years in California, embarked at San Francisco in the month of August, 1850, for Panama, on board a steamship. On the voyage, between Acapulco and Panama, he was seized by cholera. He sent for the purser of the ship, Mortimer Lent, who when he came found Dale lying dangerously ill, on the steerage deck. A sailor was in attendance upon him. The sick man held in his hands a buckskin bag of gold dust, and some pieces of coin, together amounting in value to $1770.60, which he handed to the sailor, and requested him to deliver them to Mr. Lent, which was done on the spot. In answer to questions put to him by Lent, he said his name was James E. Dale;. that he was 26 years old; that he was not married. Lent asked him who he wanted to have his effects ? He said his sister and brother, residing in Philadelphia. This, says Lent, was all he said; but on further examination, the witness stated, “ the said gold dust and coin were given to me in presence of said James E. Dale, and at his request; and he wished his brother and sister to have it.” About six hours after this occurrence Dale died of the disease from which he was then suffering.</p>

L. R. </em>635) (9 <em>Harris </em>296), that it is scarcely more than a nominal exception to the general rule that testaments must be written. And I agree it is a fair principle of decision, as suggested in Headley <em>v. </em>Kirby, 6 <em>Harris </em>329, that we take our statute of wills as a general rule, and treat <em>donationes mortis causa </em>as exceptions which are not to be extended by way of analogy. It results, thence, that nothing can be sustained by way of <em>donatio causa </em>mortis, that is not strictly and purely such.</p>

It was a gift in his last sickness, and in view of expected death; and the donees surviving him, the implied conditions were taken away and the gift became absolute. Delivery was indispensable, but whether made to the donee immediately, or to another for him, was held to be immaterial in Drux <em>v. </em>Smith, 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>404. The delivery to Lent was all that the law required.</p>

A gift is an executed contract. It may be defeated by conditions <em>subsequent; </em>but it must vest presently or it is nothing, for a mere promise to give cannot be enforced either at law or in equity. When a chattel has been given <em>causa mortis, </em>possession delivered, and death has performed the condition subsequent on which it depended, no title what <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>ever in that chattel descends to the executor or administrator, and he has no right to the possession of it for purposes of administration. If the title of the donor be so effectually divested by a gift <em>causa mortis </em>that he cannot affect it by his subsequent will, as was held in Nicholas <em>v. </em>Adams, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Whart.%2023" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Whart. 23">2 <em>Wh. </em>23</a>, then, beyond controversy, his personal representative can take no interest in it. The donee, it is true, must account for the value of the chattel, if creditors appear and there be not estate enough beside to satisfy them, for in no manner whatever can a man, living or dying, give away his estate in fraud of creditors. The law compels him to be just, before it permits him to be generous. But until the donation is needed to satisfy creditors, the donee is entitled to enjoy it, and it is not subject to the ordinary course of administration: <em>Roper on Legacies, </em>p. 3; Tate <em>v. </em>Hilbert, 2 <em>Vesey, Jr. </em>120; Walter <em>v. </em>Hodge, 2 <em>Swans. </em>98.</p>
    <p id="b64-6" data-blocks='[["BL_64.4",64,[302,1025,1156,1029]]]'>It was greatly insisted on in argument that the Court ought to have instructed the jury that if the gold was the <em>principal </em>part of Mr. Dale’s property, he could not make a <em>donatio causa mortis </em>of it, and for this Headley <em>v. </em>Kirby was relied on. In that case there was a variety of chattels — they were not specified by the donor — nothing more than a constructive delivery occurred — the language was evidently testamentary — and it referred expressly to all her property. In these particulars the case is broadly distinguished from the present, and it does not decide that where a single chattel is the whole of a man’s estate, or the “ principal part of his property,” it may not be given <em>causa mortis. </em>The doctrine of that case, predicated of the circumstances then before the Court, is not to be questioned, for it rests on sound reasons; but, if. applied to a case like this, it would defeat all gifts made as memorials of gratitude and affection in the most solemn circumstances of life. It is due to the sensibilities of our nature that the law permit, under proper limitations, such expressions of a dying man’s regards. Many a chattel of small intrinsic worth has been thus impressed with an unspeakable value, which it would be a sort of sacrilege to subject to inventory, appraisement, and sale in open market. The Court did not charge that a man could dispose of his whole estate as a gift <em>causa mortis ; </em>and if the gold dust and coin were the principal part of the decedent’s property, we see nothing on the record to impeach it as a <em>donatio causa mortis.</em>
