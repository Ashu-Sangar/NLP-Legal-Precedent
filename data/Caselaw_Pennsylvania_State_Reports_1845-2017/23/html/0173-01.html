In that month they notified Murphy that they intended to leave the premises on the 1st of April following. To this Murphy objected on the ground that they had leased for a longer period. After that, viz., in March, 1851, Murphy told the clerk of Rogers &amp; Co. that he had an opportunity of leasing the premises, and would <em>release </em>

Whitney, who stated that he was the agent of Murphy, and inquired if the rooms in question were for rent, and they were informed that they were for rent for one or for five years. At their request, Whitney drew an instrument of Writing, stating that Whitney, as agent for Murphy, agreed to bind himself to let the premises to Weaver for a period not less than one year, nor more than five years, at $200 per year. The paper was handed to Weaver. The instrument was not copied into the paper-book, but it seemed to be intimated that it was signed by either Weaver or Earl. Its date was not stated. Soon afterwards the agent perceived that the defendants, who were an Express Company, were in possession. They were in possession <em>before </em>the 1st of April, but not after that day. The agent stated that the rooms were occupied <em>by others </em>when he leased to Weaver. He stated that he received the keys of the room on the 1st of April, 1851, <em>under a protest </em>by him. He said he got the keys from the agent of Rogers &amp; Co.</p>

No facts were offered to be proved out of which his want of title would result as a legal conclusion.
