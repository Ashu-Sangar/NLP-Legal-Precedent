Further, that a creditor can sell his property to a person not a creditor, under an arrangement to pay certain of his specified debts; that he can so sell if it be done in good faith, for its full value, and for an honest purpose. But if the vendor sells and the purchaser buys for the purpose of hindering, delaying, or defrauding creditors, the sale is void as against the creditor intended to be defrauded. That if the motive be not payment of the debt, but, in the language of the statute, be to delay, hinder, or defraud particular creditors, it is void as to the creditors intended to be defrauded, though made for a full consideration, and though the proceeds have gone to the use of creditors. It is then not <em>bond fide, </em>but <em>maid fide. </em>He therefore added that if Hean sold and Maulfair purchased, for the honest purpose of paying the creditors selected and specified, the sale could not be impeached; but if Hean’s object in selling was to delay and hinder Ashmead in the collection of his debt, for the purpose of punishing him for threatening to press, or for not giving further credit (though his debt contracted in 1840, was not sued till 1847), and that such object was known to Maulfair, the purchaser, it was an improper and dishonest motive which induced the purchase, and the creditor intended to be defrauded may avoid it. The question was, therefore, one of <em>intention; </em>if the <em>motive </em>was honest there was nothing improper in the act.</p>

In doing so he did no more than any honest man, under such circumstances, ought to have done. If there was nothing fraudulent in the act and intentions of Hean, there could be none in him who purchased with a knowledge of those intentions. How can Maulfair be affected injuriously with notice of Hean’s purposes, if those purposes were perfectly honest, and such as the law sanctions ? Hean had a right to convey his property for a fair price to his other creditors, for the very purpose of paying them, and postponing Ashmead until they were paid. This is not “delaying or hindering” Ashmead within the meaning of the prohibition. It is not depriving him of any right whatever. He had no right to a priority over the other creditors. That rested with the debtor himself, and after he had disposed of it to other creditors to whom he thought it justly belonged, it would be a fraud in Ashmead to deprive them of their legal rights, thus honestly acquired. It is perfectly immaterial whether the conveyance was made directly to the other creditors, or to Maulfair under an arrangement to pay the consideration-money to them. The plaintiff in error has, therefore, no cause to complain of the instructions given to the jury on this part of the ease.</p>
