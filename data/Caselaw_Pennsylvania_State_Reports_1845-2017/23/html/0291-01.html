    <p id="b293-10" data-blocks='[["BL_293.10",293,[190,1483,1166,772]]]'>Now when can it be said that the superstructure of a bridge built under such agreements is complete? Manifestly when viewers appointed by the Court pronounce it finished, which viewers so appointed did do on the 14th day of November, 1851. On that day then the defendant’s liability attached, which can be discharged ■only by his paying what remains due on his bond. Notwithstanding some whitewashing, pointing of walls, and filling in of embankments remained to be done when the viewers were there, the evidence proved what the certificate of the viewers verified, that the structure was complete, and we think the Court put the case to the jury quite as favorably for the defendant as he deserved. When a man induces a county to undertake the erection of a bridge, by promising to pay one-third of its cost on completion of its superstructure, and its completion is ascertained in the manner stipulated in the contract which he induced the eounty to make, he is as nearly destitute of a defence as it is possible for a litigant to be. There is no lack of consideration for his promise, and I see not how he can expect to escape performance of it.</p>
