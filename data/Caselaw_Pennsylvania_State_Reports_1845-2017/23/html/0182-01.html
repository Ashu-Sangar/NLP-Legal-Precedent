The bond was given in pursuance of a special Act of Assembly passed on 14th March, 1844 (Nets <em>of </em>1844, p. 110), by which it is provided that it shall be the duty of the supervisors of the highways of every township and borough in the counties of Schuylkill, Northumberland, and Carbon, annually to select one of their number, or appoint some suitable inhabitant of the township or borough to be collector of the road taxes levied or assessed for such township or borough; which supervisor, or other person appointed collector as aforesaid, shall give bond with two or more sufficient securities, to he approved by the township or borough auditors, and deposited with them; which said bond shall be in the name of such township or borough, and the condition thereof shall he that such collector shall well and truly collect and pay over to the township or borough treasurer, if one he elected or appointed, and if not, then to the supervisors; or account for, according to law, the whole amount of the taxes charged and assessed in the duplicate delivered to such collector.</p>

    <p id="b183-10" data-blocks='[["BL_183.14",183,[189,1490,1173,690]]]'>This was correct. The liability of the sureties is contingent, and no resort can be had against them until the default of the principal is fixed. The township auditors have unquestioned jurisdiction to settle the account of the supervisor and collector, and their settlement unappealed from would be conclusive in an action upon the bond. If the supervisor neglected to appear upon notice and exhibit the state of his accounts, the auditors should have passed upon them in his absence, and unless evidence of payment were before them, they would have been justified in reporting a balance against him equal to the entire amount of the duplicate, which they could have ascertained without difficulty, as it was recited in the bond. The legislature has provided a local tribunal to determine primarily the amount of receipts and expenditures by the officers whose duty it is to collect and disburse the township revenues, and public policy coincides with the rules of law in requiring the remedy plainly pointed out to be pursued.</p>
