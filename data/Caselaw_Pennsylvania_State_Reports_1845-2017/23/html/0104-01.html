The objection was rather to the effect of the evidence than to the mode of proving it. As it appears from the counter statement that in the subsequent course of the trial this evidence was treated by the Court as of no consequence, and so the jury were instructed without objection on the part of the defendant, we would not reverse the judgment even if we were satisfied that it was erroneously received. But we think the evidence was competent to prove the allegation of the existence of a former marriage; and that such prior marriage, when established, would render void the second one. A man having a wife in full life is utterly powerless to make a valid contract of marriage, and his attempt to do so is entirely nugatory.</p>
