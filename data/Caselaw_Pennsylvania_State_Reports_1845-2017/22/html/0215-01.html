In pursuance of those instructions, Thomas Templeton, as president, and on behalf of the board of directors, made an agreement .in writing under seal with the said John McBride, dated the 22d September, 1849, by which John McBride undertook to build for the plaintiffs a school-house, in said sub-district No. 12, as specified therein, and to finish it in May, 1850, for which the directors were to pay him $220. The article was lost, but it was testified that it was signed by the president of the board of school directors, and by McBride, with a seal to each name. McBride built the^house, and the directors having paid him, from time to time, the whole amount of the consideration, except about $20, brought this suit to recover damages, both on account of defective materials and defective work. ’ Evidence, was given on both sides as to the materials and workmanship.

There was no recorded resolution nor parol instructions by the board, authorizing Cline to build the house. And the Supreme Court say, “ The directors authorized the building committee to have a school-house erected ; and possibly under this resolution the committee might have so acted as to justify, an <em>implication of a contract </em>by the board, to pay for the building; but we discover no evidence of an express contract. But only two out of four of the committee acted in the matter, and Cline was one of them; certainly the board did not <a id="p217" href="#p217" data-label="217" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*217</a>authorize him to bind them by a contract with himself.” The question was before the Court in Gearhart v.

These authorities appear to settle the law that School Directors when acting as a board, are bound by all of their acts as such, without regard to the kind of proof, provided it be the best the nature of the ease admits of; whether it be by parol or by a recorded resolution on their minutes. This was the only question raised, or point on which the cause was made to turn in the Court below; and it would therefore seem that the Court erred in their charge to the jury.</p>

In view of these authorities it would not avail the plaintiffs to have shown that they were the covenantees in the deed, unless they were also <em>parties. </em>Much less will it do that Thomas Templeton was a party to the deed and signed it as president of the board of directors, because that, as before shown, would leave it the deed of Thomas Templeton, and the covenants in it personal to him, even if the covenants were to build a school-house, which would be for the sole benefit of the directors.</p>

But a simple contract on one side is a sufficient consideration for a covenant on the other, and in strict law a covenant is binding without any consideration.
