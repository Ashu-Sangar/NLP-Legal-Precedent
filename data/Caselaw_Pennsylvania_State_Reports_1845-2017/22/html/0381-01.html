That whether the property belonged to the husband or wife was no concern to the defendant, as he did not show any claim to it under either of the plaintiffs. Even before the Act of 1848, the law permitted her to possess and sue for such chattels as it permitted her to own. As to such chattels, the rule of law; making <em>possession </em>sufficient to maintain trespass, was applicable: Herr’s Appeal, 5 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>499; 2 <em>Atk. </em>77, case of jewels claimed by the wife. But <em>since </em>the Act of 1848, the wife’s <em>chattels </em>are not more transferred to her husband than her paraphernalia: <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20272" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Jones 272">1 <em>Jones </em>272</a>, Oumming’s Appeal; 1 <em>Harris </em>480, Goodyear v. Rumbaugh. If the property had been taken on execution against the husband, a different question might exist. In a contest with his creditors it might be incumbent on her to show title as well as possession. But here, the defendant has shown no claim whatever, but it is contended on his part, that he is not bound to' make reparation till demanded <em>by the husband. </em>But here, the husband appears in Court consenting to the suit. Before the Act of 1848, when the husband <em>might </em>take the wife’s choses in action, the law would not <em>oblige </em>him to do so, even <em>in favor of his creditors: </em>Timbers <em>v. </em>Katz, 6 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>290-298-299-300. .</p>

    <p id="b386-6" data-blocks='[["BL_386.5",386,[314,563,1168,1066]]]'>The act of 1848, relative to married women, permits a wife to be the owner of property, real and personal, as if she were a <em>feme sole. </em>As between her and her husband, possession or use is no evidence of title. Either may have the other’s goods in his custody, without thereby giving even a creditor the right to treat the one who has it as the owner. The proposition which used to be a maxim, that the possession of the wife is the possession of the husband, is no longer any truer than its converse. If the husband sells it, or a creditor levies on it for his debt, and a suit is brought to recover it or the value of it for the use of the wife, she must prove by clear and satisfactory evidence that she was the owner of it at the time of her marriage, or acquired it afterwards in some way which excludes all reasonable suspicion that it is the husband’s, But where the suit is against one who can set up no pretence of claim to it through or under the husband, what right has such a person to deny the assertion which both the husband and the wife <em>make </em>that it belongs to the latter ? Here is property carried away and converted to his own use by a mere wrongdoer. A married woman brings suit to recover compensation for the injury. She alleges that it was hers. This fact no human being but her husband has a right to deny, and nobody else could be honestly benefited by showing the contrary. The husband, instead of denying it, comes with her into Court and joins in her allegation. .Thus the only person, besides herself, who could claim it, admits it to be hers. Is this no evidence of title in the wife ?</p>
