Two questions are raised. <em>First. </em>Whether the 9th section of the intestate law confines the inheritance to the paternal line of kindred, as being of the only inheritable blood through which the estate came; or whether the 11th section extends it to all the next of kin, without distinction of blood. <em>Second. </em>If confined to the paternal line, can the issue of deceased uncles and aunts inherit along with the surviving aunts.</p>

This argument would be conclusive had there been no provision for the next of kin previous to the 9th section; but the 7th section which precedes the 9th, and is one of ‘the cases before mentioned,’ provides that in default of all persons before described, to wit, lineal issue and brothers and sisters and their lineal issue, the estate shall descend to <em>the next of kin. </em>If the construction of the 11th section asked by the maternal relatives be right, it follows that the 7th, as qualified by the 9th section and the 11th section, flatly contradict each other.</p>

But when they followed the 7th by the 9th as a proviso, they undid the generality of the former, by the restriction of the latter. Consequently, as soon as the stock of kindred to whom the ancestral blood belonged, became extinct, the estate must escheat, notwithstanding there was another line of blood still living. Accordingly, to provide against this, the 10th section gave the estate in fee to the surviving husband or wife, to whom it might well be supposed the intestate would desire that it should descend, on the extinction of the line of ancestors from whom it came. Then follows the 11th section, which, in default of husband or wife, vests it in the next of kin, without respect of blood; and at the same time provides for any misconstruction of the rule <a id="p294" href="#p294" data-label="294" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*294</a>of computation of kindred, or the persons who are to inherit, by expressly excluding the common law heir. By this means the finality of the 7th section, which was opened by the proviso of the 9th to exclude a particular line, is again closed by the 11th, which readmits the excluded line, to save the escheat. This is made more manifest by being followed by the 12th section, providing for the escheat. Thus it will be seen'that the 9th operates on one class, to whom as having the’ ancestral blood it may be supposed the intestate would have given it, and the 11th can operate on another to whom he would have given it rather than to the public.</p>

This may be true of the immediate point decided. But there is an, aspect in which Maffit <em>v. </em>Clark bears on the question. The mother of the intestate being excluded by the 9th section from want of inheritable blood, is it likely the revisers intended that her brothers and sisters should take, though she' could not, and their kindred to the intestate could only be traced through her ? Yet this will be the construction demanded by defendants’ counsel. James R. Parr and Isaac Parr, the maternal uncles, were brothers of the intestate’s mother. Now suppose the mother had survived, would the inheritance have passed by her and vested in them, though they were obliged to trace kindred to the intestate through her ? The reason which in Maffit <em>v. </em>Clark caused it to pass her, must cause it to pass them also. It would be monstrous to suppose that, she being alive, her brothers and sisters should be preferred before her as to her own son’s estate.</p>

The comprehensive reasoning of the Chief Justice, who seldom descended into particulars, seems to impugn the operation of the rule excluding for want of inheritable blood. But a close, examination of the case proves the reverse, and shows that the Court held to the rule of the proviso in the only part of the case to which it could be applied. That case was a conflict between the paternal uncles and the half-sisters of the intestate. Twenty-five acres the intestate purchased, and one hundred and ten acres he inherited from his brother of the whole blood who had purchased it, and ninety acres he acquired by inheritance of one-half from his father, apd by purchase of the other half from his brother. The judgment of the Court gave all to the half-sisters, except the one-half of the ninety acres descended to him from his father, which was given to the paternal uncles. The argument of counsel is not given, but it is clear that the controversy was <a id="p295" href="#p295" data-label="295" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*295</a>whether the one hundred and ten acres descending from the brother of the whole blood to the intestate, should go to the paternal uncles, or to the half-sisters of the brother from whom they came. The reasoning of the Chief Justice is intended to show, that there was no reason why the half-sisters should not inherit the estate descending from the brother of the intestate, rather than that acquired by purchase; because they were related in equal degree to both, and could as properly inherit from the first brother, who was a purchaser, after descent cast from him, as they could from the second. But, by awarding to the uncles the half of the tract which came to the intestate by inheritance from his father, the Court emphatically recognises the rule of inheritable blood, when the estate comes from an <em>ancestor, </em>who left relatives still surviving, nearer of kin to <em>Mm </em>than the half-sisters of the intestate, who are not of kin to him at all.
