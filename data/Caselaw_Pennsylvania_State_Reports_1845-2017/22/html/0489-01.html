When a contract is made with a bricklayer to do all the brick and stone work about the erection of a building including the laying of the pavement, the contract being entire a mechanics’ lien may be filed within six months from the completion of the work although all of it may have been done except the pavement more than six months before the lien was filed. The work upon the pavement may be included in the lien.</p>

Carpenter were defendants. The dispute arose upon a claim preferred by the plaintiff to a portion of the fund raised by sheriff’s sale of a building used as a distillery, and a lot of ground. The property was sold on the 1st day of March, 1852, as the property of J. K. Tyson &amp; Co. The fund was not sufficient to pay all the claims upon it, and the plaintiff asked a <em>pro rata </em>upon his claim, for 451 yards of digging; for above 175 perches of mason work and mortar; and for 171,714 bricks and laying the same, and' mortar; and for measuring the work, in all $965.88J.</p>
