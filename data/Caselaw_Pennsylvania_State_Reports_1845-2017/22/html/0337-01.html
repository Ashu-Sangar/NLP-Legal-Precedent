This Court has already twice decided that it can: <a href="/dall/1/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="1 Dall. 165" data-case-ids="12138671,1408580" data-case-paths="/dall/1/0165-01,/us/1/0171-01">1 <em>Dall. </em>165</a>; 5 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>373. Here the error assigned is the fact of infancy, as it was in the cases just referred to, and so an error of fact was assigned in the case of Martin <em>v. </em>Ives, 17 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>364. Suppose it be denied, is the progress of this Court stopped ? Ho; for its jurisdiction does not depend on the plea which the defendant chooses <a id="p339" href="#p339" data-label="339" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*339</a>to enter. We can, if necessary, order an issue to the Court below to try the fact. But in this case the assignment is not traversed. The plea is that the fact does not appear of record, but it does clearly appear in the proceedings, and is admitted in the argument set out in our paper-book. No issue of fact is therefore necessary.</p>
    <p id="b341-6" data-blocks='[["BL_341.5",341,[199,629,1167,645]]]'>But it is argued that the opening of a judgment is matter of discretion. True; but we lay aside all the proceedings in the Court below subsequent to the judgment, and look at the judgment itself; and if that was entered on a void warrant, it must be set aside: this is matter of right, not discretion. In the older, but now unusual practice, the parties might have <em>audita querela, error eoram nobis, </em>or bill in equity to vacate such a judgment, and error or appeal here, if he failed in those below. With us, a motion to vacate is the usual substitute for those old remedies. And as the bill in equity is not general with us, and the others not commonly used, it is proper to give redress on error. In the language of Ch. J. Gibson, 9 <em>State Rep. </em>16, “ as the equity side of our courts of law is not broad enough to admit relief by bill, we are compelled to give effect to the principle by pleading or evidence, as the Court below ought to have done.”</p>

But these remedies are little used with us, though they are recognised as still existing; 1 <em>W. &amp; Ser. 438; </em>17 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>344; 11 <em><a href="/dall/1/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Dall. 165" data-case-ids="12138671,1408580" data-case-paths="/dall/1/0165-01,/us/1/0171-01">Id. </a></em><a href="/dall/1/0165-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="1 Dall. 165" data-case-ids="12138671,1408580" data-case-paths="/dall/1/0165-01,/us/1/0171-01">274, 290</a>; 1 <em>Browne </em>82; 1 <em>Miles </em>46: and generally we arrive at the same result on motion; 8 <em>Ser. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>235; <a href="/rawle/1/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Rawle 323" data-case-ids="1819319" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0323-01">1 <em>Rawle </em>323</a>.
