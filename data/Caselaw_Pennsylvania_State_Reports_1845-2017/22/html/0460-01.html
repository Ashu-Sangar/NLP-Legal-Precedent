And there is not a spark of evidence that they were placed there pursuant to defendants’ directions, or that any count had been taken of them, or that they had been bound in bundles of 80 as directed, or that the defendants had agreed or been informed that any special hoop poles were to be or were set apart for them. The ownership of them, therefore, remained fully in the plaintiff.</p>

It is said that delivery on the wharf is delivery “ alongside” of a vessel pursuant to the terms of the letter of October 21; but it is not, for the vessel was not there to receive them, and without this there could be no delivery. It would rather seem that the letter of October 21 is necessary to the construction of that of the 25th. There the contract was to deliver alongside of a vessel, that is on a proper wharf, the purchasers to pay the expenses of delivery. In this view a delivery alongside of a vessel was necessary to a perfect sale in this case, and there could be no such delivery until there should be a vessel there to receive them, and there was no such delivery, and no pretence that they were ready for delivery to the vessel.</p>
