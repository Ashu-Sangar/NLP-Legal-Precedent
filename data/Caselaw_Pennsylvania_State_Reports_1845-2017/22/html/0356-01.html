Is it proper for viewers to examine witnesses to determine the amount of damages in a case like this ? 2. If so, can the party include the charge for subpoenaing and attendance of witnesses in his hill of costs?</p>

Other statutes altering, restraining, and modifying the right of the plaintiff to costs established by the statute of Gloucester, have no bearing upon the question now under consideration.</p>
