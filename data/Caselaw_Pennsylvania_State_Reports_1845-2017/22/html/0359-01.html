Surely, if they had known that their judgment was “ as a rope of sand” in its lien upon the realty, they would not have suffered the personal property about the furnace to be sold at a price greatly below its value, and purchased by the attorney of Eichbaum, when it was selling upon an execution issued upon their own judgment, and which was the first lien upon the personal property.</p>
