Robert and John P. Boyle had a store in Masontown, about twelve miles distant, conducted in the name of John P.

It is the actual bailment of personal property as a security for some debt or engagement. In the case of a mortgage the legal title passes to the mortgagee, subject to be reclaimed at a time stipulated, and if not, then the title becomes absolute, though equity will interfere to compel a redemption: <em>Story on Bailments, </em>secs. 286, 287, 288.</p>
