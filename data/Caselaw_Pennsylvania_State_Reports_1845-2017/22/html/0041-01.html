On same day, a <em>fi.fa. </em>was issued, under which certain personal property was sold; and an <em>alias fi. fa. </em>was issued, on which the premises sold by Larimer were levied on. Those premises were sold on 21st January, 1852, and were purchased by Haigh, Hartupee &amp; Co., for $2100. The sheriff made a special return that he had applied to the judgment of Haigh, Hartupee &amp; Co. sufficient to pay it; and that there remained in his hands $215.83, which was paid into Court. To this return exception was filed on part of H. Breidenthal; and after the report of an auditor, the Court ordered the money to he refunded, or the premises to he resold.</p>

The amount of his mortgage or claim was not stated on the paper-book, but it was stated that the sheriff made a special return under the Act of 20th April, 1846, that he had sold the property to William Larimer, the plaintiff in the execution, for $5000, and it appearing from the lists of liens that he was entitled to the proceeds of sale, and he having paid the costs, the sheriff took his receipt for the residue of the purchase-money in pursuance of the Act of Assembly.</p>

The Court overruled the exception and confirmed the report; and from such decree appeal was taken on part of Larimer, the mortgagee.</p>

This question had been fully settled long before it was again presented for decision in the present case. It had also been settled long before these exceptions were filed, that a judgment entered after the recording of a mortgage acquired no priority over the mortgage by reason of being entered before the judgment on the bond secured by the mortgage.</p>

It is the interest of the public and the duty of the court to discourage all unnecessary litigation. The imposition of the costs upon the party found to be in the wrong promotes that result, and the rule should be strictly adhered to.</p>
