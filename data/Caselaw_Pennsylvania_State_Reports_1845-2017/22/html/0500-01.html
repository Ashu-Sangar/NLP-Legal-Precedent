The Act of 14th June, 1836, relating to assignees for the benefit of creditors, was intended more to determine how the jurisdiction of the Common Pleas over trustees should be applied, than to give the jurisdiction. <em>The jurisdiction </em>is given by the 13th section of the Act of 16th June, 1836, relating to the jurisdiction and powers of the Courts, which gives to the Supreme Courts and the several Courts of Common Pleas the jurisdiction and powers of a Court of Chancery, <em>inter </em>alia, as to the control, removal, and discharge of trustees, and the appointnent of trustees, and the settlement of their accounts.</p>

An assignee under a voluntary assignment for the benefit of creditors, after having accepted the trust and received moneys under it, is not relieved from the exhibition of a trust account by his having failed to give bond for the performance of his duty as trustee, or to file an inventory of the trust property. Such neglect of duty on his part will not deprive the Common Pleas of its jurisdiction over him.</p>

Because the petition showed that the assignment referred to was of property <em>in </em>Delaware, and that the moneys alleged to have been received, were collected from the Spring Garden, and other fire insurance companies of Philadelphia ; and that, therefore, it appeared that such moneys, or any contracts, either by policies of insurance or in any other form under which such moneys may have been collected, did not pass under the assignment. 3.
