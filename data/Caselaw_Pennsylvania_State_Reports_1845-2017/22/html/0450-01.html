      <em>1. </em>Actions of debt were brought after the passage of the Act of 12th July, 1842 abolishing imprisonment for debt, and subsequently, on affidavits filed alleging that the debts had been <em>fraudulently </em>contracted, warrants of arrest were granted; and afterwards by the same Court, having jurisdiction of the matter, <em>warrants of commitment </em>were issued, in the latter being recited warrants of arrest founded on <em>satisfactory proof </em>that the debtor had fraudulently contracted the debts: <em>Held, </em>that these were sufficient grounds for his custody.</p>

The judge had jurisdiction both of the actions and of the subsidiary proceedings. And the warrants of commitment show the proceedings to have been in accordance with the provisions of the 3d, 6th, 7th, and 8th sections of the Act of Assembly. They recite warrants of arrest founded on satisfactory proof that the said Michael William McCabe fraud<a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>ulently contracted the debts and obligations, respecting which the actions had been brought; and that after his arrest the evidence and proofs of the parties were heard, which satisfied the judge that the debts had been fraudulently contracted.

He permitted them to accomplish their purpose without objection. He is no longer holden by virtue of them. An adjudication, in the nature of a final decree, so far at least as the fraud is concerned, has passed against him, and he is now held by process issued therein. Where a party is in custody by virtue of a final decree or judgment, or process thereon, of a Gourt having jurisdiction, no inquiry into the process which led to the decree is to be had, and no relief administered on <em>habeas corpus: 2 Kent’s Com. </em>30.
