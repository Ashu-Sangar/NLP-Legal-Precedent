But the intention to provide for the maintenance of his widow was evidently uppermost in his mind. He gives everything “ into her hands” for that purpose. The restriction upon her power to sell except “ for her own good and support, or for the good of the place,” would seem to be an implied power to sell for those purposes. The supposed absurdity of selling the place “for the good of the place” is not forced upon us. It may be avoided by giving such a benign construction as we think the will of an illiterate man demands. The power to sell extends to everything, real and personal, and it may be that the testator intended to authorize her to sell everything except the place “for the good of the place,” and at the same time to empower her to sell the place itself if necessary for <em>her </em>“ good and support.” But the case before us does not demand a decision upon the power to sell. The question is, had she a power to <em>mortgage </em>it if necessary to raise money for her support? What else could the testator have meant by the words, “ <em>or mortgage if she needs ?” </em>
      <a id="p79" href="#p79" data-label="79" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*79</a>Here is no mere implication. It is an express power to mortgage the real estate if her necessities require it. This power is not defeated by the devise of his lands and houses to his son “ directly at his mother’s death.” The several parts of the will should be so construed as to stand together. Each clause should take effect if possible. The devise to the son is readily reconcilable with the power to mortgage given to the widow. The mortgagee has no estate in the land. His mortgage is nothing but a security for a debt. It is only an encumbrance. The two parts of the will stand in perfect harmony with each other. The son takes “ the lands and houses” subject to the charge which may be created by the widow for her maintenance. There is nothing unreasonable in this. The testator did not see anything repugnant to good conscience in charging the devise to the son with the necessary maintenance of his mother. Nor do we.</p>
    <p id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[215,1050,1168,470]]]'>But it is supposed that the power to mortgage only authorized the widow to mortgage her <em>life estate. </em>This she could do by virtue of her <em>interest, </em>without resorting to a <em>power. </em>So that this construction renders the words of the testator entirely inoperative and useless, and is contrary to the rule which requires us to give full effect to every part of the will. There is a life estate to the widow coupled with a power to mortgage the fee for her support. It is admitted that the mortgage was required for her maintenance. Its execution is conclusively established by the judgment in the <em>scire facias </em>brought upon it, and is not to be disputed in this collateral proceeding.</p>
