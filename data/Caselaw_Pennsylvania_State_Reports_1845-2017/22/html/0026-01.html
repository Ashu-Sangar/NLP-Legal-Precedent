At the time of the transfer of the note to Brown, it was expressly agreed in the presence of witnesses, that Brown should look to Hannen &amp; Co. for payment, and that Bircleback should not be liable on the note. The object of the endorsement was merely to transfer the interest of Bircleback to Brown. Afterwards, and before the maturity of said note, it passed from Brown into <em>the possession of Joseph Bingham, who </em>liad notice that Bircleback was not to be considered liable on the note. Bingham got the note from Brown under the pretence that he could settle the note with Hannen &amp; Co., he having an account with that firm. Bingham, instead of settling the note with Hannen &amp; Co., transferred it to A. Wilkins, the plaintiff in this case. It is admitted that the firm of Hannen &amp; Co. is insolvent, and was so at the time of the maturity of the note. The note was duly protested for non-pa.yment, and notice of protest was serve'd on Philip Bircleback, as the endorser. Date of protest, January 24th, 1851, and notice to Bircleback same date. The omission of words of negotiability in the note is admitted not to have been accidental, but designed to prevent its negotiation. If, upon these facts, the plaintiff be, in the opinion of the court, entitled to <a id="p27" href="#p27" data-label="27" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*27</a>recover, then judgment to he entered for the plaintiff for the amount of his claim, with costs, &amp;c.; otherwise, judgment for the defendant with costs.

As between Bircleback the payee, and Brown to whom he transferred it in blank, there was no liability, as the agreement was, that the former was not to be liable. Bingham, the next holder, had notice that Bircleback was not to be liable, and the fact of its not being a negotiable note was sufficient to put Wilkins, the plaintiff in the suit, on inquiry. Besides, it was not proved that Wilkins paid a valuable consideration for the note, and mere possession of a note <em>not negotiable </em>will not <em>prim√° facie </em>confer a right to sue. Where a note not negotiable is endorsed by the payee, with respect to such immediate endorsee, the endorsement ordinarily imposes the same obligations on the payee as the endorsement of a negotiable note. But in respect to every subsequent holder, no priority or connection is at law created between the payee and such holder, unless the payee by his endorsement makes it expressly payable to his endorsee or order, or he expressly promises to pay the note to the holder in consideration of the endorsement; and therefore such holder cannot, under such circumstances, bring any suit at law in his own name against the payee upon the dishonor of the note: <em>Story on Pro. Notes, </em>sec. 128.</p>

In that case, <em>after </em>the note had become due, Tammany, the payee, in order to induce Leidy to take the note, endorsed it, and promised that if Leidy would take the note, he would cash it before a time designated. Leidy, therefore, was the immediate endorser of Tammany; there was a direct contract between them, and Tammany was estopped from setting up any defence either to the form of the action, or the merits of the case. <em>In this ease, </em>the note was endorsed by Bircleback several months <em>before </em>maturity; the endorsement was to be a mere transfer of his interest; there was to be no liability on his part. Wilkins was no party to the transfer, and if he can maintain a suit at all, it should be brought in the name of Brown, who was the immediate endorsee: 10 <em>Barr </em>31, Gillespie <em>v. </em>Mather; <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Whart.%20331" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="5 Whart. 331">5 <em>Wharton </em>331</a>; 6 <em>W. </em>
