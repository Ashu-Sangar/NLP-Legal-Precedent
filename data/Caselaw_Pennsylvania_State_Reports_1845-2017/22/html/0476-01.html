If the goods have been fraudulently transferred by the debtor they are open to seizure at the suit of any creditor who thinks proper to incur the risk, and to assume the task of establishing the fraud. The plaintiff in the bill has an equal right with the other creditors to enter the lists. If he chooses to resort to his execution he may do so. The course is open to all, and the most vigilant is, in general, the most successful. But if the property is protected from seizure during the delay which may arise before the bill can be brought to a hearing and final decision, the Act of Assembly may produce the very evils which it was designed to remedy. A lien upon personal property,'without seizure, to continue for an indefinite period, or to abide the uncertain event of a lawsuit, would be productive of so much embarrassment in the transaction of business, and is so entirely at variance with our legislative policy, that we cannot suppose the Act of 1886 was intended to create it. The Act admits of a construction less inconvenient in its results, and more in accordance with the established policy of the state; and that construction is adopted.</p>
