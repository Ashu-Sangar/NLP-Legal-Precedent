D. 185 , on the estate of Seth Matthews, deceased, and converted the assets of said estate into cash, and used them in his business. On the 7th day of November, 1851, whilst indebted to said estate in the sum of $1579.84, he executed a vol<a id="p17" href="#p17" data-label="17" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*17</a>untary assignment for the benefit of his creditors. The assignee filed his account, showing $3486.71 for distribution. An auditor having been appointed for that purpose, the indebtedness of the assignor being about $18?000, the heirs of Seth Matthews claimed that the indebtedness to their father’s estate, aforesaid; should be <em>first </em>paid in full. The auditor allowed their claim. Exception being taken, by other creditors, to such allowance, the matter was argued before the Court of Common Pleas, but the report of the auditor was <em>confirmed. </em>Appeal on the part of the other creditors to this Court was taken, and one of the exceptions was to the payment <em>in full </em>of the claim of Matthews’ heirs.</p>

So long as it can be identified either as the <em>original property </em>of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>or as the <em>product of it, </em>equity will follow it; and the right of reclamation attaches to it until detached by the superior equity of a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser, for a valuable consideration, without notice. The substitute for the original thing follows the nature of the thing itself so long as it can.be ascertained to be such. But the right of pursuing it fails when the means of ascertainment fail. This is always the case when the subject-matter is turned into money and mixed and confounded in a general mass of property of the same description: <em>Story’s Equity, </em>sec. 1257, 1258, 1259. This mixture has taken' place in the case under consideration. It is impossible for a chancellor to lay his hand upon a single article of property or on a single dollar of money included in the assignment, and say that any particular thing or sum of money is either the original property of Seth Matthews’ heirs or the product of it. The decree below was therefore erroneous.</p>
