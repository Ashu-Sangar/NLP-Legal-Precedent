It is certain that at the death of Robert Smilie on the 16th October, 1851, it was not only vested but was due and payable, according to the terms of her grandfather’s will. But before it became payable, to wit, <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>on the 27th March, 1846, she had joined her husband in a deed, duly acknowledged, by which the legacy was assigned for a valuable consideration to John McBurney, whose administrator claims the money.

But there are numerous English authorities the other way: <em>Gilb. Eq. Rep. </em>88; 2 <em>Atk. </em>207; 1 <em>Atk. </em>280; 2 Atk. 549; 2 <em>P. Wms. </em>608; 3 <em>P. Wms. </em>200; <em>Dicken’s Rep. </em>491; 1 <em>Bro. Ch. </em>51; 1 <em>P. Wms. </em>459, note; 12 Ves. 175; 9 <em>Ves. </em>100; 2 <em>Russ. &amp; Mylne </em>355. Mr. Butler in his note <em>Co. Litt. </em>351 a, note 304, edition of 1794, lays down the doctrine that the wife’s <em>possible </em>or <em>contingent </em>interest in a term of years; if it is a <em>legal </em>interest, may be assigned by the husband, unless perhaps where the possibility or contingency is of such a nature that it <em>cannot </em>happen during the husband’s lifetime. In Grey <em>v. </em>Kentish, 1 <em>Atk. </em>280, Lord Chancellor Hardwicke held, that although a husband cannot assign <em>in law </em>a possibility of the wife, nor a possibility of <em>Ms own, </em>yet <em>equity </em>will support such an assignment for a valuable consideration. And in 1831, in Donne <em>v. </em>Hart, 2 <em>Russ. &amp; Mylne </em>360, Sir John Leach, Master of the Bolls, decided, that “it was clear that a wife’s <em>contingent </em>interest in a term, may be sold by the husband, and there is no difference <em>in equity, </em>between the <em>legal </em>interests in a term and the <em>trusts </em>of a term.” But whatever conflict of authority may exist elsewhere on this question, the able opinion of the late Chief Justice Gibson, in Siter’s Case, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Rawle%20483" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Rawle 483">4 <em>Rawle </em>483</a>, has fully demonstrated that a contract of assignment for a valuable consideration, entered into by a <em>feme, </em>through the agency of her legal representative (her husband), binds her in a Court of Equity, and that the distinction attempted between <em>vested </em>and <em>contingent </em>interests, has no place in the law of Pennsylvania: <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Rawle%20482" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="4 Rawle 482">4 <em>Rawle </em>482</a>. The husband is considered the legal representative of the wife in all matters which relate to her <em>choses in action, </em>whether contingent or otherwise, and an assignment of them is regarded as <em>her </em>contract through his agency, by virtue of the power conferred upon him with her consent, by the marriage. It is certainly true that where a <em>chose </em>in action is not due and payable, the husband cannot reduce it into possession by action; but this arises not from any defect in his marital power, but from the nature of the thing itself, which prevents her as well' as himself from <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>demanding it by action before it is payable. If the <em>feme </em>were <em>sole, </em>her claim would be subject to the same impediment. This is no reason why she cannot transfer her right, such as it is, to another. She could undoubtedly do so if sole, whether the demand be vested or contingent; and such assignment would, in equity, estop her from claiming the money against her own assignee. As her husband is clothed with her power over such interests, her assignment through his agency for a valuable consideration, is as binding upon her as if made by herself. The principle which governs in this and kindred questions is that every act done by a representative under competent authority, is binding upon those by whom or for whose benefit the authority was conferred.</p>
    <p id="b136-6" data-blocks='[["BL_136.5",136,[300,907,1165,896]]]'>In Honner <em>v. </em>Morton, 3 <em>Russ. </em>65, Lord Chancellor Lyndhurst declared that equity considers an assignment by the husband as amounting to an agreement that he will reduce the property into possession, for the benefit of the assignee. Where <em>the </em>husband has the power to do so, equity considers it as done. Where he has not the power, the assignment remains inoperative until by subsequent events he comes into a situation to be able to reduce the property into possession, and then his previous assignment will operate on his actual situation, and the property will be transferred.” This is in accordance with the familiar principle that subsequent acquisitions feed the estoppel of grants made before the right had accrued to the grantors; or, in other words, where a party makes a conveyance without title, if he afterwards acquire one, it shall enure to the benefit of his grantee. The assignment in this case having been made by the wife through the agency of her husband, the vesting of the interest afterwards enures to the benefit of her assignee. Conceding that the Act of 1848 might operate on contingent interests, originating before its enactment but vesting afterwards, the principle of estoppel applies with equal force. Having once received the proceeds, she shall not also take the thing itself.</p>
