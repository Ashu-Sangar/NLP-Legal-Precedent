      <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>Upon the ground of policy, the rule is firmly established in Pennsylvania, that a party to a note or bill which is strictly negotiable and has been actually negotiated, cannot be a witness to impeach it. He cannot be permitted to show that in its concoction it was unavailable as between the payee and the maker. But this rule does not apply to matters arising subsequently to the creation of the original liability, as between other than the first parties. In Appleton <em>v. </em>Donaldson, 3 <em>Barr </em>381, one of the payees of the note, for whose accommodation it had been made, was permitted to prove that it was pledged by the firm of which he was a member, to the plaintiff as collateral security for the payment of a sum less than its face, and that a tender had been made for the amount of the pledge. In the case of the Harrisburg Bank <em>v. </em>Forster, <a href="/watts/8/0304-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="8 Watts 304" data-case-ids="1848385" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0304-01">8 <em>Watts </em>304</a>, it is ruled that whether an endorser is a competent witness, depends upon the character of the evidence which he is to give. That although he is incompetent to establish a want of consideration to the note, he is competent to prove a direct payment of it by the maker. So in Snyder <em>v. </em>Wilt, 3 <em>Harris </em>59, (Hover, a party to the original instrument upon which the action was based, was received as a witness as to matters which took place after the execution of the draft. The same principle was held in Maynard <em>v. </em>Nekervis, 9 <em>Barr </em>81.</p>
