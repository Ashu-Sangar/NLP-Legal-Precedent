The act of the Court in the case now before us, by which the acknowledgment of the deed was received and entered of record, and certified, was certainly equal to granting the sheriff permission to amend his return; and the deed thus acknowledged, with the sanction of the Court, was as effective, in amending the previous return, as that which was held to produce the same effect in Vastine <em>v. </em>Fury.

But this was impossible. The judgment in favor of Moreland upon McGregory’s equitable interest was for a sum greater than Gray was to pay for his purchase. But independent of that judgment, McGregory’s title was imperfect, because it was but a contract with Wallace for the land, upon which the purchase-money remained unpaid. So that if Gray paid the purchase-money due to Wallace, the land was still liable to sale under the judgment of Moreland against McGregory. If he paid the latter judgment, Wallace might recover the land in ejectment on his legal title. The only safety of Gray consisted in extinguishing both claims; and this could not be done without paying a large sum, more than the price agreed upon in his contract with McGregory. McGregory, whose duty it was to protect his vendee, and to discharge the encumbrances, disregarded his obligations to his creditors, as well as his contracts with Wallace and Gray. Under these circumstances, Gray had a right to purchase the equitable interest of McGregory, at sheriff’s sale, under the judgment of Moreland; and this purchase entitled him, upon the recovery of a conditional <a id="p16" href="#p16" data-label="16" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*16</a>verdict for the land, by Wallace, to pay the purchase-money due to the latter, and to perfect his title by receiving a conveyance from his devisee.</p>
    <p id="b18-4" data-blocks='[["BL_18.5",18,[319,520,1159,169]]]'>The Act of 14th March, 1846, is constitutional. In permitting certified copies of sheriffs’ deeds, previously recorded, to be given in evidence, in all cases where the originals would be evidence, it neither divested a right nor impaired a contract.</p>
    <p id="b18-5" data-blocks='[["BL_18.6",18,[318,688,1162,386]]]'>This ejectment was brought in 1851; nearly thirty years after the sheriff’s sale to James Gray, and twenty years after the conditional verdict in favor of Wallace. After such inattention to the obligations of his contracts with Wallace and Gray, and such long-continued acquiescence in the judicial proceedings to transfer and extinguish his rights, we do not see how his claim could have been sustained by the Court below. The objections to evidence were properly decided, and the instructions to the jury were as favorable to the plaintiffs in error as they had any right to demand.</p>
    <p id="b18-6" data-blocks='[["BL_18.7",18,[1101,1074,330,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
