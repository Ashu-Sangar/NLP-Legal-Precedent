Most of the consideration was satisfied on that day, as it consisted in part of advances made to the vendor while building the boat, and in part of other demands against him, on which it did not appear that the defendant was allowed any interest afterwards. The residue of the money was secured by a note also drawn and dated on the day when the bill of sale was drawn. There was some evidence tending to induce a belief that the instruments were drawn in pursuance of a previous understanding, and that the defendant expected them tó be signed on that day. There was no evidence to show that the delay was owing to any dispute in regard to the terms of the contract, and when the papers were signed, the dates continued unchanged. There was no evidence to show that the original dates were adopted by mistake. Nor did the defendant give any evidence to show that his actual participation in the profits commenced at a period subsequent to the date of the bill of sale to his trustee. There was evidence of repeated acknowledgments of his interest in the boat, made subsequent to the period when the liability arose, without stating when that interest was acquired. Under these circumstances, it was not error to submit the question to the jury. The bill of sale is not. the contract of partnership. It is only evidence of it, and it is certainly not conclusive evidence that the partnership did not commence on the day specified by the writing itself.</p>
