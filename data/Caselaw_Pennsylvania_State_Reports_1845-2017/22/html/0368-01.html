It frequently happens that the taxes for the current year are not, and cannot be returned in time for the commissioners to include them in the list furnished the treasurer; and as the purchaser has notice by his deed what taxes are embraced in the sale, he cannot complain of being misled.</p>

County and state taxes are assessed in the fall of the preceding year, and road taxes in the spring. There can be no difficulty, with ordinary diligence, in furnishing to the treasurer a statement of such of the unseated taxes as remain unpaid, long before it is necessary for him to give the requisite notice of the sale, and such as are not included may fairly be presumed by the purchaser to have been in some manner satisfied.</p>

    <p id="b376-11" data-blocks='[["BL_376.10",376,[328,1869,1166,514]]]'>If the land in the hands of a purchaser is free from encumbrances due to strangers, is there any reason why an existing lien in the nature of - a tax should outlive the sale? The whole policy of our recent legislative enactments and judicial decisions has been to protect tax titles and thereby encourage purchasers, as it is often the only means of enforcing the payment of taxes against uncultivated lands. It would doubtless deter persons from bidding at tax sales if it is understood that the lands may again be sold for taxes assessed long before the purchase. If the taxes are returned, they may be and should be included in the sale. If they are not returned, their lien, if any exists, is a secret one, and should have no force as against a <em>bond fide </em>purchaser.</p>

The evidence certainly “ tended to show that the land became seated in 1831, and so continued,” and this is all that was said by the Court. The instruction might have been given more in detail as to what would change a tract from unseated to seated; but we cannot reverse because the law is not fully explained, when such explanation is not solicited.</p>

It is not under the sale of 1832 that the defendants claim. It was given in evidence, not by them, hut by the other party, and I cannot see the force of their objection to the first redemption.</p>

Huzzard told him that his title was worth nothing; that he could easily get round it, but that he had acted honorably in writing to them, and he wanted him to get something. That he would give him his note for $115 if Bleakley would give him a deed in his own name, until such time as the heirs would fix it with him; that when he got home they would fix it all right. He said repeatedly <em>“ </em>every heir should get their share; all he wanted was to secure himself as to the $115.” Part of the contract was that the heirs were all to get their shares.</p>

If he was intrusted by them to negotiate with Bleakley for the redemption or purchase of the land, he could not, by taking the deed in his own name, set his constituents at' defiance. Huzzard surely cannot complain if he is taken at his word. He told Bleakley that he was acting for the heirs, and Bleakley says that it was upon this representation that he was induced to part with the title. If he had acted Ihonestly he could have held the estate until he was repaid his advances ; but his conduct in denying the claim of his principals leaves him without even this ground to fall back upon.
