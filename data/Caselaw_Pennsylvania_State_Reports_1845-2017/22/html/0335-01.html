    <p class="summary" id="b337-7" data-blocks='[["BL_337.7",337,[237,1025,1176,606]]]'>This was an action of debt by Sidney Doe <em>v. </em>Reuben, Peter, and John Fritts. It was brought on the insolvent bond of Reuben Fritts, in which the other defendants were sureties. The bond was dated January 16, 1851, and was conditioned for the application by Reuben Fritts for the benefit of the insolvent laws under the Act of 12th July, 1842. His petition was filed on the 4th February, 1851, and the 4th Monday of April was fixed for the hearing. Objection was made that the oath to the petition had been made before the prothonotary without it appearing to have been made <em>in open Court. </em>The hearing was continued till the 2d of May, and again till the 9th of May. On that day the affidavits of two persons were filed, and were to the effect that the affidavit of the petitioner had been made <em>in open Court; </em>and an affidavit by <em>the prothonotary </em>was to the same effect.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b337-9" data-blocks='[["BL_337.9",337,[241,1756,1169,479]]]'>Per Curiam.—On the 9th of May the Court refused to discharge the petitioner because of defect in form of petition, and this defect was corrected with leave of the Court, and the hearing on the merits continued to this term and new notice required. Now, no sufficient cause being shown, I cannot perceive why the Court should withhold the discharge. * * * * The whole matter being <em>in fieri </em>as it were, although the same be defective, it is time to have it put in form, and which is ordered accordingly. The petitioner, therefore, is not deprived of his right to a discharge by means of any cause shown, -and is therefore to be discharged on making the required assignment and taking the requisite oath.</p>

Here the affidavit to the petition, as originally filed, was taken before the same officer, and for this the Court was about to dismiss the petition; but, upon being satisfied that the oath was in fact taken in open Court, a new affidavit, properly administered, was permitted to be appended to the petition, and the hearing continued'until the next term, when the applicant was duly discharged.</p>
