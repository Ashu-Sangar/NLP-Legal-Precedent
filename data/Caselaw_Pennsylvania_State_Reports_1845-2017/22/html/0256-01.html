Its assessment and sale was therefore a plain violation of his <em>rights; </em>and to compel him to lose his land, or to pay a large sum for improvements made without his knowledge or consent, was, to say the least, a somewhat harsh rule to apply to one who was in no default whatever. But the plaintiffs in error, not content with the construction of the statute already given in their favor, ask us to go further, and hold, that, as the money was not paid within what they call a reasonable time, they have an indefeasible title to the land; or, if not, that they are entitled to Toe remunerated for improvements made since the verdict, with interest upon the first assessment.</p>
