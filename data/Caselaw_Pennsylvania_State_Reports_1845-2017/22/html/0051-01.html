    <p id="b55-11" data-blocks='[["BL_55.14",55,[246,1285,1166,301]]]'>The object of the rule requiring affidavits of defence, and that the nature of the sainé shall be specifically set forth, is to prevent unnecessary delay; but to prevent delay is not the sole object of courts of justice. Defendants have rights as well as plaintiffs, and whilst justice should be administered promptly it should be done, whenever practicable, without deprivation of right. To delay justice is an evil—to deny it, is a greater evil.</p>

Was this mistake irremediable? The court below thought it was, and gave judgment for the entire amount of the plaintiff’s claim, notwithstanding the allegation under oath, that defendants’ set-off would extinguish the whole of it. There is no feature in our system of pleading, which is more generally approved than that authorizing amendments in any stage of a cause. It commends itself to the minds of all persons as eminently calculated to promote the ends of justice, and its spirit may be safely infused into the preliminaries of judicial proceedings not strictly within the letter of the statute regulating the formation of issues. The rule of court under which this judgment was entered declares' “ That the plaintiffs may enter judgment by default any time after the return-day and ten days’ service’ of' the writ, provided he has filed a declaration, unless the defendant should have previously filed an affidavit of defence,” &amp;c. Without doing violence to the language of this rule, the word “ previously” may be referred to the entry of judgment rather than the time when it <a id="p54" href="#p54" data-label="54" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*54</a>might have been entered. But admitting the contrary construction, the rule nowhere prohibits the filing of an affidavit after the ten days have expired from the service; nor does it authorize a judgment after a sufficient affidavit has been filed.</p>

So in the present case. The plaintiff was entitled to a judgment for want of a sufficient affidavit within ten days from the service of the writ; hut if the affidavit was actually made and filed before the judgment was obtained, it was in time to save the default, and prohibit the summary action of the court.</p>
