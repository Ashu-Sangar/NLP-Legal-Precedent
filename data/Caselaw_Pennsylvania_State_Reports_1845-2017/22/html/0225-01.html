Declarations of the plaintiff during the lifetime of the son, and acts and declarations after the decease of the son, were relied upon as evidence of a contract. A few acres of the land had been cleared, and a house erected by <em>Oveit, </em>while he had an interest in it. The defendant proved, by her father, D. A. Conover, her marriage in the fall of 1847, when, or soon after, she and her husband moved on the land; that he occupied and worked it; built a barn, dug a <a id="p227" href="#p227" data-label="227" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*227</a>well, improved some, made some fence, set out some fruit trees, and built a hog-pen, remaining until 1849,-when the deceased rented the farm to the witness and another for $45 and the taxes for a year.

The witness stated that, during the' son’s sickness and shortly before his death, he went to have a settlement with him about the rent, when he asked the plaintiff what <em>he </em>had to say about it, who replied that it either was Michael’s or it was his business, and not his; and it was .adjusted between the father and son-in-law. That in September, 1848, the father told the witness that Michael had been a good boy and paid him for the land—that no deed had been yet <em>got out </em>for it; but that he would get one in his (the son’s) name,—that a report had been puf in circulation that he would not do so, but it was false; that it was a good thing Michael had no deed, as he was in the Baldwin Mill Co., and if it broke down, his creditors could not take the land:—That in September, 1850, he was in conversation with Michael’s parents about his support, when the father said the farm would keep him if he could not work—and that a few days before his death the deceased requested the witness to sell his land and settle his accounts, which he promised he would do. (The deceased had fifty acres by contract from the witness.) The witness further stated that, in the month following Michael’s death, he with others, at the widow’s request, called oh the plaintiff to talk about his concerns — that she wanted no will or gifted property, but her husband’s, to administer upon and pay his debts ; that plaintiff replied he owed Michael nothing, but that he owed him. Witness' asked him if Michael had not paid him $80 on the land; he said he had paid him $75, to which the other replied that that would make it <em>real estate. </em>That plaintiff said- he had made a settlement or agreement with Michael before his death-that he would pay his widow $500, which the son thought it would be better to take than keep the land. That witness asked him if he would not take the fifty acres he had sold Michael, and pay what was owing <em>hivi </em>for it, and all the debts, which he thought would be four or five hundred dollars; to which the plaintiff said he would make a proposal, — to pay the widow $500 in ten yearly instalment's, with interest, pay the witness’s demand, about $50, and all the debts of the estate. That the plaintiff’s wife then came into the room and said she was displeased when Michael bought the fifty acres, as he had enough of his own before. That on the same or next day a bond for the $500 was drawn, which the plaintiff declined signing on account of the interest W'hich it called for. A few days after, the'parties again met: and the plaintiff said that, as he supposed the witness had full authority to settle the estate as executor (though there was no will, nor had letters <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>of administration been granted to any one), he would agree to pay the widow $100 in two years, the witness’s claim, with interest, and all the debts. The scrivener asked what consideration he should mention in the writing for the premises, when plaintiff said the claim which Michael had in the Oveit farm,—and two notes were then drawn and signed by the plaintiff—also the agreement of plaintiff with Conover as executor of Michael, by which the former, “in consideration of a claim the said Michael had on the farm,” agreed to pay the widow $100, all the debts, and Conover his claim ; but the $500 bond was not signed. That some time after the plaintiff came to the witness with a citation to have the defendant take out letters of administration, and saying that what they had done would amount to nothing, that it was not done according to law; and that witness replied he would have nothing more to do with it. That in April, 1851, the plaintiff called on the witness and agreed to pay the writings as he gave <em>them; </em>that the latter said they were in Meadville, and that they agreed to go there and bring the matter before the Court. That at different times afterwards witness asked plaintiff if he would settle as he had agreed, when he said not; that the land belonged to him, and that it was <em>a gift </em>or willed property to his son—that witness had no right to it,—that <em>he </em>did not owe Michael anything, and that the widow must go off. The witness testified—under an exception by the plaintiff—in answer to a question by the defendant, how Michael was in possession when he claimed the land,—that Michael said, while on the land, that he was there under his father bv purchase.</p>

Conover tells you that in 1847 the plaintiff told him that his son, then the husband of the defendant, had been a good boy, that he had.bought the land from him and paid him up—that he (the plaintiff) had not got a deed yet from the office, as he had not himself paid all the money for it, and when he did so, and took out the deed, he would take it in Michael’s name. If the facts were true as stated by plaintiff, if <a id="p232" href="#p232" data-label="232" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*232</a>rightly understood and truly testified hy Conover, it would be pretty conclusive evidence of such a contract as would take the case out of the statute, if accompanied by the other requisites. It is in evidence also that he afterwards stated, that it was a good thing that the deed had not been made to Michael because he was engaged in the Baldwin Mill Company, and if it would break down Michael could not sell the land. There was evidence also that plaintiff stated that Michael had paid him part on the land and still owed him more on it. Does this, together with his statements in 1850, in relation to the rent of the farm coming from Conover and Graham, that it was Michael’s business and not his, and the settlement and payment of the rent to Michael under this statement, when applied to by the tenant—his acknowledgment of his agreement with Michael on his death-bed to pay the widow a sum of money, with debts, &amp;c., for Michael’s interest in the land—the negotiations afterwards by way of settlement, satisfy you of the existence of the contract, sale and payment, as alleged by the defendant—was the possession delivered to Michael in pursuance of the contract, if such contract has been shown. It is testified he moved into the old house in the winter of 1847-8; was this in pursuance of the alleged contract? This is a necessary and essential ingredient in the title—for although, as I apprehend, a man might even sell to one in possession as his tenant, yet if the sale was clearly proved, a possession might be delivered anew in pursuance of the contract of sale. Does the evidence in this case clearly satisfy you of such delivery of possession in pursuance of the contract of sale ? If the testimony of Conover and Graham satisfy you that in 1850 the plaintiff recognised Michael as the landlord of the land, as the owner, it is a strong circumstance in proof of his possession being in pursuance of the contract, provided you are satisfied of the existence of such contract, sale, and payment of purchase-money. This possession must also be <em>exclusive; </em>that is, it must be such as to leave no legal right in the vendor to enter on the premises or part of them. Had Michael then such a contract, such an exclusive possession delivered in pursuance of it, and had he the legal control and management of the farm by virtue of such contract and possession ? If he had, the circumstance of the father coming there occasionally or even grazing cattle on the farm, would not destroy such exclusive possession.</p>

The first thing necessary to such a defence was clear and explicit proof of the contract, of all its terms and conditions; for, before a chancellor would decree specific performance, which is of grace and not of right, he would require to be shown very clearly what the contract was—that it was fair and conscionable, executory, founded in sufficient consideration, and so far executed that it would be a fraud on the vendee or his heirs not to execute it fully. The party seeking specific performance must show affirmatively that he has been in no default, which cannot be explained and excused, and that he has taken all proper steps towards performance on his own part, for mutuality is of the essence of all contracts, and indispensable to move the conscience of a chancellor. A promise to convey is only one side of a contract, and, without the counterpart, is nude. What did the other party agree to do ? Was he to pay money ? How much, and when ? To take possession, and maintain it, and make improvements under the contract ? Then let him allege and prove these things. Let him show <em>hoth </em>sides of. the contract, or else not expect a decree of specific performance.</p>

This testimony is denied by the plaintiff point blank. How, were the parties in Chancery, on bill and answer, specific performance could not be decreed on such evidence, for a chancellor invariably refuses, to decree on the uncorroborated testimony of a single witness, in opposition to even the defendant’s interested answer on oath, though it cannot be read in evidence for him at the hearing: 7 <em>Barr </em>159.</p>

The evidence also of the father’s acts of ownership, such as pasturing and cropping part of the place, whilst Michael lived there, tended, not only to negative a sale,, hut to show that there was no exclusive possession in Michael. And so as to the negotiations between Conover and the plaintiff, after Michael’s death; though they indicated that Michael had an interest in the land, for the extinguishment of which the father was willing to pay his debts, yet, as evidence of a contract of sale, they were worthless. For what was Michael’s interest, and how much was to be paid for it, and how much had been paid, and when, and on what conditions was his father to convey the title ? These are pertinent and obvious questions, which the evidence does not answer, and without full information on these points, there could be no decree. The admission of $75 paid, helps us to no suspicion even of how much remained unpaid. As was said in Soles <em>v. </em>Hickman, 8 <em>Harris </em>180, a contract is as much void where the <em>consideration, </em>as where the <em>subject, </em>is undefined. We held in that case, on a full revieAY of the authorities, that a <em>written receipt </em>for part of the purchase-money, defining the land sold, but not defining the price or any other terms of sale, did not take the case out of the statute.</p>
