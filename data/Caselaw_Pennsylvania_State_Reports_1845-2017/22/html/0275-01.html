In an application by a husband for a divorce, the wife in her answer alleged as the cause of her desertion, that her husband had assaulted her with a knife in his hand and hurt and drove her off, and had been guilty of other misbehavior towards her which justified her desertion, without otherwise specifying the particular misconduct; to which the husband made a general replication and denial, and demanded an issue. On the trial no special instructions were asked, and the Court submitted to the jury whether the respondent had suffered such treatment as acquitted her of wilful and malicious desertion, and verdict was rendered for the respondent: <em>Held, </em>that no special instructions having been asked of the' Court, <em>this Court </em>will presume that the matters alleged in the answer were true, and that the desertion was justifiable.</p>

The rule contended for by the plaintiff in error may be conceded: that the reasonable cause which would justify a wife in abandoning her husband must be such as would <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>entitle her to a divorce.

    <p id="b279-6" data-blocks='[["BL_279.5",279,[219,487,1170,644]]]'>It will not be disputed that the matters alleged in the respondent’s answer would, under the Act of Assembly, be cause of divorce. Sitting in a Court of error, we are obliged to assume that these matters have been found; so that, according to the strictest application of the rule contended for, they were sufficient to justify her desertion, or, at the least, to take away from it the wilful and malicious aspect which the statute requires it to bear in order to'entitle him to a divorce. Whether the acts <em>proved </em>amounted to such cruel treatment as justified her desertion, is a question that does not arise on the record, and therefore we do not decide it. The Court below expressed no opinion on this point, and not being asked to do so, the omission is not assignable for error, for it has been often ruled that want of direction, not asked for, is not error: McClure <em>v. </em>McClure, 1 <em>Barr </em>374; Churchman <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/whart/6/0146-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Whart. 146" data-case-ids="1836941" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0146-01">6 <em>Wh. </em>146</a>; Burns <em>v. </em>Sutherland, 7 <em>Barr </em>108.</p>

The declarations of the wife, the night of her flight, were so connected with the principal fact under investigation as to b'e competent' as part of the <em>res gestee. </em>In Rawson <em>v. </em>Haigh, 2 <em>Bing. </em>99, cited by Mr. Grreenleaf, letters written during absence from home, were admitted as original evidence explanatory of the nature of thé departure and absence, the departure and absence being regarded as one' continuing act. Here the declarations were much more immediately connected with the act of departure than the letters in that case, and were full as worthy evidence, explanatory of the motives of the party.</p>
