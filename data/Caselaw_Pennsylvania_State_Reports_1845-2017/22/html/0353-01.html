Regularly, the return should have been addressed to the clerk of the Court; but where it clearly appears that no one could possibly be injured by the mistake of the commissioner in this respect, where the deposition was, first actually examined by the objecting party, and where it was at once filed among the records, the irregularity in the return is not a sufficient reason for excluding it.</p>
