There is no evidence that Frances M. Smith, under her deed from James McDonnell, is asserting any title or claiming any right to the life estate arising under his lease from Philip Smith. The deed to Frances M. Smith was made by McDonnell, at the request of her father’s executors, who, at the same time, executed and delivered to McDonnell a written declaration, expressly intended to save his rights under the lease from their testator, and to prevent his deed from operating as a convey<a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>anee of his life estate. Whether the declaration has this effect, is a question not necessary to be now determined. It is admitted that the defendants have been in the undisturbed possession and occupancy of the premises since the date of the plaintiffs’ conveyance to them. Neither Frances M. Smith, nor any one claiming under her, is asserting any title to the life estate of McDonnell. The reserved question is, therefore, on the authority of Ludwick against Huntzinger, 5 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>51, ruled in favor of the plaintiffs.- In that case, which was an action on a bond for the purchase-money of land conveyed by the plaintiff to the defendant, the Court say: ‘It is not sufficient’ to rebut the presumption arising from acceptance of a deed and giving bond ‘to-offer or give evidence tending merely to show that the title which the purchaser has got is doubtful, or not merchantable, but he must show that it is positively bad, by proving a superior indisputable title to the land in a third person or party, <em>who is asserting his right thereto by virtue of such title ; </em>otherwise it may be that the purchaser will never be disturbed in his enjoyment of the land by reason of it; or if he should, he may have his remedy -on the covenants contained in the deed of conveyance made to him ; and if it be that he has taken no covenant for that purpose, it goes strongly to show that he agreed and was satisfied to take the title of the vendor pretty much at his own risk.’ These considerations are strongly applicable to the case of a sale of land made by assignees, under an assignment for the benefit of creditors.
