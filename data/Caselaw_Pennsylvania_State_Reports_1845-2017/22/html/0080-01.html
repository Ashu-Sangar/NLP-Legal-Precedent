It is true that a partner, acting within the scope of the business of the partnership, is authorized to draw, accept, 'and endorse bills in the name of the firm.

There is nothing, however, on the face of the bill indicative of its unusual character, or calculated to excite suspicion in the mind of a person unacquainted with the handwriting of McClurkan, the resident partner. An inspection of the draft would naturally lead to the inference that it was drawn, as it purported to be, by the partner at Pittsburgh on his copartner in Philadelphia; and that it was endorsed by the former and accepted by the latter in the ordinary business of their firm.</p>

Plow otherwise could he have ascertained that the signature of the partnership was genuine ? The ascertainment of its genuineness would necessarily have led to a knowledge of the fact that the draft was drawn and endorsed by Fleming, which sufficiently indicates that it was drawn and endorsed by him for his own separate accommodation.</p>

He is not, if the proper inquiries usually made by a prudent man would have led him to the knowledge of the fact that the acceptor, or principal debtor,, had himself drawn the bill, or in other words, made the contract that is intended to pledge the partnership as surety for himself.

Without this proof, we must take the apparent transaction to be the true one, and regard Fleming as borrowing money for himself, and attempting to pledge his partner as his surety; that is, we must decide the case according to the evidence.</p>
