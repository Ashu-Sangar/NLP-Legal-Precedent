The deeds from <em>Holden’s heirs </em>to the plaintiff in the action, are no evidence of the extent of <em>Gray’s </em>claim; he being in fact a stranger to them or their conveyances. <em>There </em>was <em>then no </em>designation of the extent of their claim, until the survey made by Brister for Vanatta in 1837; but a few years before bringing suit.

If he claimed ups to the line of the plaintiffs survey, used it as his own, exercising the usual acts of ownership over, and paying taxes upon the whole tract, twenty-one years before the suit was brought, the statute will protect him for the whole. But the claim to the whole extent of the plaintiff’s boundaries, and the acts of ownership under it, must be shown affirmatively by the defendant to have existed for the period required by the statute. It is not to be presumed, without evidence, that an intruder, without color of title, adopts the boundaries of another title as his own.
