Quain, the decedent, died in August, 1850, without issue, leaving a widow and two brothers, viz.: Margaret Quain the appellant, William S. and Robert M. Quain. Letters of administration were granted to the widow and <em>her </em>brothers, who filed their account thereof. The account was referred to an auditor to adjust, and make distribution of the balance. Before the auditor, a claim for $187.50 was presented on behalf of Charles Norris and others, trustees, for 30 months’ arrears of ground-rent on a lot conveyed by the said trustees to the said Andrew M. Quain, of which but 12 months’ rent was due and in arrear at the time of his decease. No judgment had been obtained for the same. In the ground-rent deed, Quain covenanted for himself, his heirs, executors, and administrators, to pay a ground-rent of $75 per annum, half-yearly on 1st January and July. At the time of his death, two half-yearly payments were due, and three other half-yearly payments became due before distribution was decreed. The claim was resisted by the widow, on the ground that it was no lien on the fund for distribution, which was derived exclusively from <em>personalty, </em>and that they should first resort to <em>the land </em>charged with it; and that, as it was resisted, the auditor could not take cognisance of it, the estate being <em>solvent. </em>The auditor disallowed the claim.</p>

Quain, was claimed by him, and also by the widow. The widow claimed the share of William upon the ground that immediately after the decease of Andrew, William gave up to her all his right to any part of the estate, asking only a gun which had belonged to the decedent; -which gun was taken by her and given to him. Witnesses were produced before the auditor upon the subject, and the auditor decided that the .share had been relinquished by William, and given up to the widow, and he awarded it to her.</p>

Of the rent, $75 was in arrear at the death of Quain ; the balance of $112.50 claimed, became payablé afterwards. If this balance is to be paid out of the personal estate, the payment would, in a great measure, be adverse to the interest of the widow and in favor of the heir, and the lot was unproductive.

Does a ground-rent covenant survive against, executors and administrators ? In its usual form it binds heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns: but still this may be satisfied, as to executors and administrators, if they pay the rent which accrued in the decedent’s lifetime.</p>

If we retain the perpetuity of the covenant as against them, even with the restriction that they are to be liable only when the resort to the land is ineffectual, we still prevent all distribution of the- estate in their hands;, and, as all <a id="p513" href="#p513" data-label="513" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*513</a>the lands of the decedent are assets for the payment of- debts, we constructively charge the rent of a single lot upon all his lands.</p>

If that suggestion means until all other matters are ready to be settled, then it takes away at once the character of perpetuity belonging to the covenant, and makes its duration, as against the personal estate, to depend upon the accident of the administrator’s diligence, or of the involved or simple nature of the estate. If it means until the final settlement of the whole estate, then this perpetual covenant postpones it for ever. This cannot be ; for the law intends the office of executor or administrator to terminate as soon as possible: it cannot be prolonged on account of perpetual covenants.</p>

The grantor of the land cannot be presumed to have then placed any value on such a covenant; for the personal covenant of the original grantee is as nothing in a series of tenants lasting for ever. The real security is the covenant running with the land and encumbering it; and this is the essential reliance of the owner of the rent. It is an absolute obligation, as against the administrators, or it does not bind them at all. Suppose it absolute; then the duty must be fully performed by perpetual payment, or else it must be discharged by a satisfaction or commutation ; and in this latter case the rent would be discharged and the heir released, a result which is certainly unintended. It is a covenant payable, in the contemplation of the parties, out of the profits of the land; and it would be entirely unreasonable that the law should hold the administrator for the rent when it gives the land to the heir.</p>
