In an action of <em>assumpsit </em>on book account, in addition to the pleas of <em>non assumpsit </em>and payment with leave, and set-off, it was pleaded specially, that the defendant had delivered to the plaintiffs three promissory notes of third persons, payable to the defendant or his order—that the defendant endorsed the said notes and delivered them to the plaintiffs, who accepted and received them for the amount of the said notes. The notes were payable in iron metal. There was no proof that the plaintiffs had agreed to accept the notes in payment or to assume the duty of collecting them, it being alleged by the plaintiffs that they were not left even <em>as collateral security, </em>but merely for the convenience of the defendant that the metal in which they were payable might be received by them and accounted for by credit on the book account. The makers of the notes failed, the notes being unpaid. It was <em>Held, </em>that it was error in the Court to charge the jury that “under the facts in evidence, ‘assuming their truth,’ the opinion of the Court was that the amount of the notes ought to be credited, and that the ‘ verdict should be rendered accordingly.”’ The nature of tie transaction was a question of fact, and should have been submitted to the jury.</p>

If the notes were received as collateral security or for the purpase of collection, the holders were bound to use ordinary diligence in. their collection, and if the notes were lost for want of such attention they would be liable to the owner to the extent of the injury; but if they were left with the holders merely that they might receive the metal, in which they were payable, when it was delivered, they would be liable to account only for the amount received by them.</p>
