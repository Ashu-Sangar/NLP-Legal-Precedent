That the pendency of the action of ejectment, which was brought in due time, was a bar to this action of trespass, for the reason that if the plaintiff recovered in the ejectment and brought an action for mesne profits, the recovery in the present case would not be a bar to that action. 4.

Their applications are dated both on the same day (namely, September 3), but Stewart’s was in the morning, and McKiernan’s in the evening, after he knew of Stewart’s. The somewhat doubtful question which arose on these facts—I call it doubtful, because there are decisions upon it by this Court which seem to conflict with one another—came up before the board of property on a <em>caveat, </em>and was there decided (March 6, 1846) in favor of McKiernan.

The party who has the decision of the board in his favor is fictitiously deemed to be in possession, but it is provided in the act that “such supposed possession shall nevertheless have no effect upon the title.” The object is to get a decision precisely such as the board ought to have given upon a view of the papers in the land office, and such facts <em>in pais </em>as may legally modify the effect of the recorded documents. But in an action of trespass the result may often depend on mere accidental circumstances. Possession, for instance, of one or the other party may be a fact so controlling, that the question of title would be left wholly out of sight. This case, indeed, came very near being one of that kind. If the actual occupancy of the defendants had been a little better made out, they would have taken the verdict on that ground alone. If this had happened, could the plaintiff, in case he should get the <a id="p405" href="#p405" data-label="405" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*405</a>patent afterwards, recover for the same trespass in another action upon any principle except that the first action would not lie ? I ask this question not to answer it (for that would carry us beyond the record), but merely to suggest a difficulty which may as well be avoided.

In principle the case is made no way different by the fact, that the appeal from the board is to the Common Pleas. A tribunal to which an act of Assembly gives appellate jurisdiction has no more right to take original cognisance of the same subject while the appeal is pending, than it would have if the right to hear the appeal had been given to another.</p>
    <p id="b407-7" data-blocks='[["BL_407.6",407,[171,1188,1167,429]]]'>We therefore decide that from the time the <em>caveat </em>is entered, until the right to the patent is finally determined, neither party (supposing him not in possession) has such a title as will sustain trespass against the other. An action brought afterwards by the patentee will lie for all injuries committed pending the dispute, and this, together with the writ of estrepement, is a sufficient protection to him who is finally adjudged to be in the right. It would not be proper now, to say what remedies may be had against strangers. It is. enough to add, that no rule here laid down applies to actions by or against persons not parties to the <em>caveat.</em>

The earlier warrant is the better title. We. cannot recede from the rule which this Court established when the case was here before. It is the settled policy of the law, to make land titles depend as much as possible on written evidence. When two warrants are taken out on the same day, the record will show which is the elder one. But the priority of- applications which bear even date, can only be determined by parol, and then, according to the doétrine of the plaintiff in error, the. right is not settled without showing that the later applicant knew what had been done by the other. In a title twenty years old, what chance would there be of proving the .truth concerning such facts as these ? Great uncertainty would be the necessary consequence. And <em>cui bono ? </em>Merely to restore to a slow man the advantage <a id="p406" href="#p406" data-label="406" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*406</a>•which another has achieved by swifter motion. Of course I am speaking of cases in which there is no fraud. A party does no wrong who desires vacant land and tries to get it, though he may know that • another is moving under the same impulse. It is no imputation on the fairness of the race that the winner was behind at the start.</p>
