    "head_matter": "Yearsley versus Flanigen.\n1. When a contract is made with a bricklayer to do all the brick and stone work about the erection of a building including the laying of the pavement, the contract being entire a mechanics\u2019 lien may be filed within six months from the completion of the work although all of it may have been done except the pavement more than six months before the lien was filed. The work upon the pavement may be included in the lien.\n2. But if the laying of the pavement be done under a separate contract from . that of constructing the walls and other masonry of the building, the case will be different.\n3. But though the contract for constructing the building and laying the pavement be entire, if the building is finished and the contract treated by the parties as complete, and a considerable time has elapsed before the pavement is laid, and other rights have intervened, the claim filed more than six months from the date of the last work upon the building, will be too late.\n4. The same principles apply where the property is sold at sheriff\u2019s sale before the expiration of the time allowed by law for filing a lien. The claim may then be made upon the fund, with the same effect as it could be made against the building if the claim had been entered of record before its sale.\n5. Whether the contract with the mechanic included the laying of the pavement as well as the erection of the building, when contested and contradictory evidence has been given upon the subject, was for the consideration of the jury. See also 6 Harris 160, Holden v. Winslow; 7 Id. 341, Bartlett v. Kingan.\nError to the District Court, Philadelphia.\nThis was a feigned issue in which Pascal Yearsley was plaintiff, and John Flanigen and Geo. W. Carpenter were defendants. The dispute arose upon a claim preferred by the plaintiff to a portion of the fund raised by sheriff\u2019s sale of a building used as a distillery, and a lot of ground. The property was sold on the 1st day of March, 1852, as the property of J. K. Tyson & Co. The fund was not sufficient to pay all the claims upon it, and the plaintiff asked a pro rata upon his claim, for 451 yards of digging; for above 175 perches of mason work and mortar; and for 171,714 bricks and laying the same, and' mortar; and for measuring the work, in all $965.88J.\nOn the trial it appeared that the plaintiff had been employed by J. K. Tyson & Co. to do certain brick and stone work at or about the building; and a witness testified that one of the firm of J. K. Tyson & Co. spoke to the plaintiff about doing the brick and stone work for the building referred to, to lay all the bricks about the building, the stacks, foundations, and pavement.\nAnother witness stated that the pavement was laid in November, 1851; that it was completed on the 8th November. That about the 1st of November, Tyson came to him and said that Yearsley had told him that when he, Tyson, wanted the pavement laid, to let him know, and he would send men to do it; and that he (Tyson) wanted it done then. The witness said that he sent men and had it done.\nJ. K. Tyson, a witness called on part of the defendants, testified that the work done by the plaintiff on the building was done before the engine was started, which was on the 27th of June. He further said that they (Tyson & Co.) did not expect to have to lay the pavement for two or three years, and would not have done so but for a notice received. He said that nothing was said about laying the pavement when the bargain was made with Yearsley. That when he got the notice to have the- pavement laid (it was from the office of the district), he saw the foreman of Yearsley about laying it.\nThe notice to have the footway or pavement laid was dated October 23, 1851.\nStroud, J., inter alia, observed in his charge, that it would seem as the result of the evidence,, that all the work, except the pavement, was done by the 18th of July. He charged that he entertained \u201c no doubt but that the pavement is no part of the buildingthat \u201c no agreement can embrace it; they cannot make it a lien; they cannot alter the law.\u201d\nOctober 22, 1852, verdict was rendered for the defendants.\nError was assigned to the portion of the charge above referred to.\nHamilton, for plaintiff in error.\nThe Act of 1836 provides that a lien may be had for debts contracted for work done or materials furnished for or about the erection or construction of a building. By the second section it is provided that the \u201c lien of such debt shall extend to the ground covered by such building, and to so much other ground immediately adjacent thereto, and belonging in like manner to the owner of such building, as may be necessary for the ordinary and useful purposes of such building.\u201d\nIt was said that in this case the delay in laying the pavement was owing to the owners of the building. It was alleged that the contract was entire, and that before the pavement was laid a claim could not legally have been filed, as the contract would not have been compl\u00e9te.

That the pavement was to be considered in determining this case reference was made to 10 Barr 413, Pres. Church v. Allison; 1 Harris 497, Barclay\u2019s Appeal; 8 Barr 473, Lauman\u2019s Appeal; 5 Harris 234, Harper v. Keely; 6 Harris 160, Holden v. Winslow; 7 Harris 341, Bartlett v. Kingan.\nPerkins, for defendants in error."
