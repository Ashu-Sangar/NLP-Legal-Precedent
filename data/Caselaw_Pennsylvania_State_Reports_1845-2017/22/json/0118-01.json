Any assignment not in accordance with this rule, will be held the same as \"none.\u201d\nThe specification of error in this ease, relates to the admission of Thomas Norris as a witness; but neither \u201c the bill of exception\u201d nor \u201cthe full substance of it,\u201d is stated \u201cin immediate connection with the specification.\u201d Indeed, neither of these important particulars is to be found in any part of the paper-book.

    "head_matter": "Rice versus The Farmers\u2019 and Drovers\u2019 Bank.\nIn an assignment of error to the admission or rejection of evidence, the bill of exceptions should be stated in immediate connection with the specification, or the full substance of the bill be stated.\nError. to the Common Pleas of Greene county.\nThis was the case of a scire facias issued in favor of The Farmers\u2019 and Drovers\u2019 Bank of Waynesburg, for the use of Houlsworth, v. William Rice, endorser of Davidson and Harris.\nOn the trial, on the part of the bank was offered in evidence the record of a judgment No. 168, of September Term, 1842, in favor of the said bank against Davidson and Harris.\nAlso, judgment No. 72, of March Term, 1844, entered the 19th of March, 1844, for \u00a71015.81, in favor of said bank against Thomas Norris, endorser of Davidson and Harris. On this judgment several executions issued against Norris; upon which his farm was levied on and advertised to be sold; and on the day of sale was cried by the sheriff, when an arrangement was made between Norris and Houlsworth, by which the latter was to take an assignment of the judgment which was to be allowed as cash on the price of Norris\u2019 farm; which Houlsworth was about purchasing. Accordingly this judgment, on the 3d of April, 1847, was assigned by the bank to Houlsworth.\nAlso judgment No. 351, to March Term, 1843, in favor of said bank against William Rice, endorser of Davidson and Harris. Upon this judgment the present scire facias issued.\nTo this scire facias the defendant plead payment, and payment with leave, &c.\nUpon the trial, after the exhibition of the original judgment against the makers and each of the endorsers, and the assignment by the bank to Houlsworth of the judgment, viz. Judgment No. 72, March Term, 1844, the plaintiff closed.\nIt was stated on the paper-book that the defendant then produced evidence to establish as a defence, that he was a Subsequent endorser to Norris on the note on which judgments were originally obtained; that the drawers had fully indemnified Norris, by funds, property, and securities placed in his hands, and that in-consideration thereof Norris had released the drawers from any liability on account of what he had paid, or what he might have to pay on account of his endorsement; that the assignment aforesaid, by the bank to Houlsworth, was in pursuance of an arrangement between Houlsworth and Norris, the terms' of which, as disclosed, by the evidence, were, that if Houlsworth would purchase the judgment, Norris would let it come in as so much cash paid Houlsworth on the price of Norris\u2019 farm, for which they were then bargaining.\nIn order to rebut this defence, the plaintiff called Thomas Norris as a witn\u00e9ss. To this witness the defendant objected; but the Court overruled the objection and admitted the wituess.\nTo this the defendant\u2019s counsel excepted.\nIt was assigned for error, viz. \u201c The Court erred in admitting Thomas Norris as a witness.\u201d\nDowney and Rowe, for plaintiff in error.\nSayers and Black, for defendant in error."
