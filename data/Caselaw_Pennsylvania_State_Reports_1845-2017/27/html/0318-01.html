On the 8th April, 1852, he sold it to her, and she in the month of July following sold it for $2200, taking negotiable notes in payment. Leech died in August, 1852. James Donaldson and' Joseph Leech became his administrators, sold his real estate, and filed their account, which was confirmed absolutely, showing a balance of $2564.61 for distribution. Auditors were appointed to distribute this fund. Before them, it appeared that the intestate owed a number of debts for goods purchased at the time of the sale of the store to his wife. Other claims were presented for goods purchased by Mrs. Leech after the sale to her. On the 8th April, 1852, Leech gave a judgment to J. Donaldson in trust for the payment of the debts of the store then existing. Mrs. Leech appropriated all the negotiable notes except one for $366.12 in paying some accounts. Foreign attachments were issued against her by J. D. Smith &amp; Co. <em>et </em>al., and the note for $366.12 was handed over by her agent to their attorney, who gave a receipt for it as follows:—</p>

Wilson, were the property of Andrew Leech in his lifetime, and of his administrators upon his decease. But they were never claimed by either. Mrs. Leech exercised the exclusive control over them, and parted with them to such creditors of her own or her husband as she chose. The note which forms the subject of this dispute was received by the attorney of the appellants from the agent of Mrs. Leech, under the express stipulation in the receipt that the claims in his hands were to be paid out of future funds <em>pro rata. </em>He did not receive the note as a part of the dividend, to which he was or would be entitled out of the assets of the estate of Andrew Leech, but as payment in part of the demand which he held against Mrs. Leech and her deceased husband’s estate.</p>
