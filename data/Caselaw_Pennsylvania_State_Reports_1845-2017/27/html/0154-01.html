Taxes were assessed upon this tract for the years 1842, 1843, and 1844; and in 1844 it was sold at treasurer’s sale to Nelson Richmond. In September, 1846, after <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>the time for redemption had passed, Freeman procured a man by the name of Oviatt, to pay to Richmond the amount of the purchase-money paid by him, and twenty-five per cent, added, and Oviatt to hold the deeds until Freeman should repay him.

I accepted the proposition, and he got Judge Richmond to come off the bench and he received his money. I counted the money on the prothonotary’s table, and he received it either off the table or from Freeman. He was then sick, and went directly home and didn’t come out again; I think he went home immediately from court — was the last business he ever did. Freeman ordered me to make the title to Sartwell and Steele a short time before the money was due, on their paying me the money. They did pay me, and I believe I made a short affidavit of it to the Orphans' Court. I proved the contract in the Orphans’ Court; I think there was another affidavit besides mine; the lands were held by me subject to F.’s order, and he ordered me to convey to Sartwell and Steele.”</p>

Oviatt swears that as between Richmond and him the transaction was an absolute purchase of Richmond’s title, made after the time of redemption had run out, and that he did not communicate to Richmond what had transpired between him and Freeman. He bought, it is true, at the request of Freeman, and Freeman was to. have the benefit of his purchase, provided he paid according to the terms of their arrangement the price he had stipulated to pay. Judge Sartwell on-behalf of himself and Stéele and Freeman made the payment, hut Richmond did not convey either to him or Oviatt. Consequently, neither of them acquired title; and upon the evidence disclosed, neither of them could compel the specific execution of the contract, for the simple reason that it was void under the statute of frauds. If the title had passed to Freeman or to Sartwell, the fiduciary relation existing between Coxe and Freeman, and the bad faith of Freeman towards Coxe in permit<a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>ting tbe land to be sold for taxes, and thus attempting to defeat Ooxe’s title, and vest it in himself or some other person for his benefit, might have raised a trust in him and his confederates, of which Ooxe could avail himself. But this fiduciary relation and bad faith would not affect the legal rights of Judge Richmond, who, for anything that appears in the evidence, must be regarded as the absolute owner of the title, and as occupying the position of any other vendor by a parol contract unaccompanied with possession in the vendee.</p>

The only difference is that here the time for redemption is passed. But why could not Richmond waive the time and accept the money ? If he accepted of it as a redemption, it required no conveyance to divest his title.

The sale to Richmond, regular in all preliminaries, divested Coxe’s title if there was no redemption, and whether a redemption or not was the question in the cause. There was no evidence of a redemption within the statutory period of two years after the sale, and on this ground the court assumed Richmond’s title to be perfect, and withdrew the case from the jury.</p>

Where lands offered at treasurer’s sales for taxes are not bidden for to the amount of taxes and costs, the county commissioners are required to buy them for the county, to hold them five years subject to the owner’s right of redemption, and, after that period, are authorized to sell them at public sale to the highest and best bidder. After the five years the title becomes absolute in the county. The commissioners are mere ministerial agents of the corporation, and no Act of Assembly-has given them power to extend the time of redemption. Yet it was held, in Steiner <em>v. </em>Coxe, 4 <em>Barr </em>26, on reasons that are unanswerable, that a private sale by the commissioners to the former owner, after the five years had elapsed, being essentially a redemption, was good to divest the title of the county, though not to alter tbe title of the owner. If this be so in respect to county commissioners acting in a representative capacity, why may not an individual purchaser, who is bound to consult no interests but his own, permit a redemption after his title has become absolute ? He is not <em>compelled </em>to insist on the confiscation of his neighbour’s land, and if he prefers to take his money, with the 25 per cent, increase, and surrender the land, it is hard to imagine a reason why he may not do it. It <a id="p159" href="#p159" data-label="159" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*159</a>required an Act of Assembly to <em>compel </em>Mm to take his money and give up the land within two years; but no legislation was provided, because none was needed, to <em>permit </em>him to take it, either within the two years or afterward. His volition is restrained by no law, and therefore it is quite free.</p>

Oviatt acted at the instance and for the benefit of Freeman, who was bound to Ooxe by the articles of agreement of 18th October, 1842, to pay the taxes and to prevent a sale of the land. The deed was subsequently made to Sartwell and Steele, but by Freeman’s direction, and after they had become interested in the Ooxe titles by virtue of their agreement with Freeman of the 25th January, 1847. When their interest commenced is not apparent, for their written agreement recites an agreement <em>“made some time since,” </em>but if before the two years elapsed, they were under the same legal and moral obligations as Freeman to see that Ooxe’s titles were not impaired by treasurer’s sales, and to redeem any tract which, through inadvertence, had been sold. The money they paid in pursuance of Oviatt’s arrangement with Richmond, seems to have been exactly the amount payable as on a redemption.</p>

Freeman could not, with a good conscience, take back Richmond’s title in any other manner, for he was under an express promise to Coxe to pay the taxes, and it would be a gross fraud in him to suffer the land to be sold for the very taxes he had bound himself to pay, lie by two years till the day of redemption was gone, and then buy in at the price of a redemption the title of the purchaser and set it up against that which he had undertaken to guard. So far as Oviatt acted for him it is difficult, consistently with common honesty, to .regard the transaction as anything but a redemption. And whether Sartwell and Steele were not so implicated with Freeman as to make a presumption of redemption equally necessary for them, would be worthy of the serious consideration of a jury.</p>
