Afterwards, on the 13th day of July, 1850, the decedent executed his last will, which was duly proved on the 17th day of September, following, in which is contained the following bequest, to wit: — “ Item — I give and bequeath to my daughter, Mary Adaline (in lieu of bond which I <a id="p120" href="#p120" data-label="120" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*120</a>gave to David Marr, in her favour), the one-half of the residue of my estate, real and personal.” The guardian of the child refused to accept of the bequest under the will of the testator, and claimed- the amount of the bond aforesaid. The executors paid the amount of the bond to the guardian, and took his receipt; and in their account filed, claimed credit for the said payment. This item on the credit side of the account was excepted to. Samuel Weiriek, Esq., was appointed auditor, and sustained the exception. The accountants excepted to the report of the auditor, but their exceptions were overruled by the court, and the auditor’s report confirmed. And from this decree the accountants appealed.</p>

There is nothing in any part of the record to impair the force of this finding, or to create a belief that it is erroneous in point of fact. . The possession of the bond, by the executors, after they have paid it, and are entitled to the possession of it as a voucher, is no evidence to show that it never was given. At least this circumstance cannot have the effect of overthrowing the positive finding of the auditor.</p>

The seal imports a consideration, and creates a <em>legal </em>obligation. In a “voluntary” bond no consideration is contracted for or expected. The absence of one is therefore no ground for • equitable relief from a contract conceded to be good at law, without' it. To say that the “want of consideration” is a defence against a bond is to express, in language not remarkable for precision, nothing more than the familiar principle that where the obligor fails to receive the consideration contracted for, and on the faith of which he entered into the contract, he is not bound <a id="p121" href="#p121" data-label="121" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*121</a>to pay his bond. This principle has no application whatever to the case before us, because no consideration was contracted for or expected. A voluntary bond, it is true, must be postponed until <em>creditors </em>are paid; but it is always good against the party himself, and against <em>heirs, legatees, </em>and others who stand in no higher, equity: 2 <em>Williams on Executors, </em>871; 3 <em>P. Wins. </em>223; 2 <em>Mylne &amp; K. </em>769. In this respect a <em>simple </em>contract differs from a specialty. In the one case the party is not bound without a consideration: 5 <em>T. R. </em>8. In the other no consideration is necessary if none was contracted for: <em><a href="/johns/17/0239-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="17 Johns. 301" data-case-ids="6065034" data-case-paths="/johns/17/0239-01">17 John.

With this correction the decree is affirmed, the parties excepting to the account to pay the costs.</p>
