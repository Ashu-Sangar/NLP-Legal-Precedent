To induce a decision in favour of the western, the defendant, A. J. Rhey, signed and delivered to the company the following promise:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b261-13" data-blocks='[["BL_261.11",261,[216,1979,1170,130]]]'>“ I hereby agree that in case the western route for tli'e plank-road is adopted, that J. C. O’Neil will subscribe $500 additional stock, for which I hold myself personally responsible.</p>

Subsequently, Rhey and O’Neil were both called on, and the subscription required and demanded, but refused. Hence this action of <em>assumpsit </em>to recover damages for the breach of the alleged contract.</p>

In charging — as to the measure of damages — “The true amount as it seems to us would be, what would give the company the advantage which they would have derived from the subscription if the contract had been complied with by the defendant. That would be the measure of injury which was sustained by the failure to comply. The case is different from a stock contract between individuals, respecting stock owned in any enterprise. In that case the subsequent advance or depreciation would be the measure. But to a company disposing in the first instance of its stock in order to collect and accumulate funds, or secure capital to prosecute an enterprise in progress in order to get it to a point that it could be profitably used for its intended purpose, might not every share of new stock sold be considered equal in value to its amount of capital contributed for expenditure? If this promise had been complied with and kept, the company would have had that amount of ‘ additional funds for that purpose, while the defendant or J. C. O’Neil would have got the stock.”</p>

    <p id="b263-6" data-blocks='[["BL_263.4",263,[215,588,1168,691]]]'>The true measure of damages, was the difference between the value of the stock at the time of the trial, and the amount which the defendant had agreed that O’Neil should pay for it. This will make good to the plaintiff the actual loss sustained by the nonperformance of the defendant, and will at the same time relieve the defendant from the necessity of himself becoming á stockholder in a company in which he had never subscribed, or agreed to subscribe to the capital stock. To allow the full subscription price as the measure of damages, is to allow the company to get the money and keep the stock, or in effect to change the terms of the contract by compelling the defendant to do himself what he had stipulated that another should do. The case was not one for specific performance: 1st, Because O’Neil could not be compelled to take the stock; and 2d, Because a recovery of the difference between the par and the market value would be an adequate remedy for the injury sustained.</p>
