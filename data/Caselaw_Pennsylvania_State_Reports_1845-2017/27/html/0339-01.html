That which a company is authorized to do by its act of incorporation, it may do; beyond that all its acts are illegal.

On the other hand, the counsel for the plaintiff insist that it must begin at the borough line, and not elsewhere. Our opinion is with the defendants on this point, but we think the argument on it was rather beside the purpose, since the terminus of the railroad is neither at the line of the borough nor inside of it. Coming from the east, it passes the east boundary of the borough at a distance of sixty rods south, and runs on about-rods further, in a direction precisely parallel with the south line of the borough, and there stops or connects with the road built by the Franklin Canal Company to the Ohio line. Certainly this is not a literal compliance with the act of incorporation.

In 1848, and before the defendants’ work was made, its limits were extended so as to include the place where the terminus of the railroad had been fixed. At a still later period, the borough was incorporated as a city. But we are very clear that this alteration of the borough lines did not in the least change the rights or obligations of the railroad company. All laws must be executed according to the sense and meaning which they imported at the time of their passage. A line which did not exist until 1848, could not have been in the mind of the legislature in 1842. The modifications made in the charter of the borough left the defendants’ charter just where it was before. The amendment of one is not to be taken as a supplement to the other. If “ the east boundary line of North-East township” had been shortened or obliterated, or differently named by an Act of Assembly passed in 1848, the defendants would have understood very well that their right to locate the eastern terminus on any part of the township line as it existed in 1842, was not thereby altered or taken away. The law commanded the defendants to begin their railroad at the borough of Erie as it then was, and that command is in full force notwithstanding the change which has been made in other matters.</p>

The place at which the terminus should be established being precisely and particularly designated by the act of incorporation, in words which rendered mistake impossible, all other places, whether near or far, are as surely excluded as if they had been expressly forbidden. If we cannot hold companies to a strict compliance with their charters, we cannot hold them at all. In some situations (and, for aught we can see, this may be one of them), the purpose and object of allowing the road to be built can be as completely defeated by a deviation of sixty rods as sixty miles. The directors must have thought that they could gain a point of great value to them by changing their terminus, or else they certainly would not have ventured upon it in the teeth of the law. And they must have been conscious, too, that the legislature had some important reason for confining them to the borough, or else they would have sought and got an amendment to their charter. This railroad was probably intended as an outlet to New York for the lake trade of Erie. It could not have been meant as a link in the connexion between <a id="p354" href="#p354" data-label="354" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*354</a>Buffalo and Cleveland, for there was not then any authority given to this company or any other to build a road westward from Erie to or towards the Ohio line. Its actual location puts it beyond the reach of the lake trade, being one hundred and ten feet above and three-quarters of a mile distant from the harbour. It connects itself there with a road to Ohio built in violation of law, and by a fraud which has already received its condemnation. By this means it has become part of a continuous line from New York to the West, carrying goods and passengers not to the borough of Erie, but quite around and past it. I mention this merely as showing that the general scope of the law, as well as its literal words, has been disregarded. It is suggested, however, as a mere probability. We do not know nor care what the purpose of the state may have been. But one thing we do know — and that is enough —that the board of directors had no right’ to substitute their will for the plain requirement of the law. If the fair interests of the stockholders, — if the accommodation of the neighbouring people,— if a due regard for the commerce of the whole country, — if a magnanimous liberality to the citizens of adjoining states, — if these considerations, or any one of them, required an amendment of the charter, the managers should have asked the proper authority of the government to make it. Assuredly there is no legislative body on the face of the earth to whom such an appeal, if well grounded, could be made with more certainty of success than to the General Assembly of'this state.</p>

The right of the supreme legislative power to authorize the building of a railroad on a street or other public highway is not now to be doubted. It has been settled not only in England (1 <em>Barn. &amp; Ad. </em>30), but in Massachusetts (<a href="/citations/?q=23%20Pick.%20328" class="citation" data-index="17" data-cite="23 Pick. 328">23 <em>Pick. </em>328</a>), New York (<a href="/citations/?q=7%20Barb.%20509" class="citation" data-index="18" data-cite="7 Barb. 509">7 <em>Barb. </em>509</a>), and in Pennsylvania (<a href="/citations/?q=6%20Whart.%2043" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="6 Whart. 43">6 <em>Whart. </em>43</a>). If such conversion of a public street to purposes for which it was not originally designed, does operate severely upon a portion of the people, the injury must be borne for the sake of the far greater good which results to the public from the cheap, easy, and rapid conveyance of persons and property by railway. The commerce of a nation must not be stopped or impeded for the convenience of a neighbourhood. But we can say this only in cases where the authority has been given by the sovereign power of the state. That any private individual or incorporated company, not empowered to do so by an act of the legislature, can take possession of a street and make a railroad upon it without being guilty of a criminal offence, is a proposition which I am sure no lawyer would dream of making. The right of a company, therefore, to build a railroad on the street of a city, depends, like the lawfulness of all its other acts, upon the terms of its charter. Of course, when the power is given in express words, there can be no dispute about it. It may also be given by implication; for instance, if a company be authorized to <a id="p355" href="#p355" data-label="355" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*355</a>make a railroad, by a straight line, between two designated points, this implies the right to run upon, along, or across all the streets ©r roads which lie in the course of such line. So also when an act of incorporation directs a road to be made between certain termini, by such route as the grantees of the privilege shall think best, it may be located on an intervening street or other common highway, if in the judgment of the directors it be necessary or expedient to do so. But when an act of incorporation authorizes the making of a railroad which it is not possible to make without using the streets of a town for part of it, still such streets cannot be so used if the same act of incorporation forbids it. If the powers given to the corporators cannot be executed rvithout disregarding the restrictions with which they are coupled, they cannot be executed at all. In a private deed, an exception as large as the grant, is void because private deeds are construed most strongly against the grantor. But a grant of privileges by the state, to a body of adventurers, must be construed precisely the other way — 1 in favour of the public and against the grantees. A prohibition, exception, or reservation in a charter, must therefore stand in full force, though it destroy or make nugatory all the powers given to the company.</p>
    <p id="b355-6" data-blocks='[["BL_355.4",355,[209,1343,1172,806]]]'>The act of incorporation now before us, contains the following very emphatic clause: “ The said railroad shall be so constructed a-s <em>not to obstruct or impede the free use </em>of any public road, <em>street, lane, or bridge, </em>now laid out, opened, or built, or to interfere with any burial-ground, dwelling-house, or building without the consent of the owner.” It would certainly strike most men upon the first look, that a railroad company with such a provision in its charter is on dangerous ground when it takes possession of a street. It is not at all easy to understand how the people of a city can have the use of a street free from obstructions and impediments, when the street is of ordinary width, and has two railroad tracks upon it, along which locomotive engines, with trains of cars, are running every five minutes of the day. Nor is it by any means impossible, that in this case the legislature intended to exclude the company altogether from the streets, even at the risk of having no railroad made; for the desire to preserve to the people of Erie and its neighbourhood the free use of their streets and roads, may have been stronger than the wish to establish a railway communication for them with New York.</p>

A road may be obstructed more or less. The word impediment is almost synonymous with obstruction, except that it is seldom, if ever, used to signify an entire blocking up of the way. It is an obstacle — not an impassable barrier. To understand these words in their ordinary import, and then say that a railroad is not <em>per se </em>an obstrue<a id="p356" href="#p356" data-label="356" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*356</a>tion or impediment to the free use of a street by the public, is rather more than I can do. But perhaps it is not quite safe to interpret them according to their popular sense. Certain it is that they have sometimes been otherwise used in Acts of Assembly. A law of Massachusetts provides, that “ if any railroad shall be so laid out as to cross any turnpike or other way, it shall be so made as not to <em>obstruct </em>such turnpike or way.” It was decided (<a href="/citations/?q=23%20Pick.%20226" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="23 Pick. 226">23 <em>Pick. </em>226</a>), that this did not prevent all interference with the road, but required only that it should cause the least possible inconvenience or impediment. By a statute of this state, enacted in 1803, the owners of lands adjoining navigable streams were permitted to build dams, provided that such dams should “ not <em>obstruct </em>or <em>impede </em>the navigation of such streams, or prevent the fish from passing up the same.” This court (<a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20440" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="4 Watts 440">4 <em>Watts </em>440</a>) declared, that if these words were taken literally, the owners could not avail themselves of the privilege at all; but as this construction would have been contrary to the grant itself, a more liberal one was adopted, and a dam which did not <em>materially </em>hinder the navigation was held not to be within the prohibition. Although the reasoning of these cases does not altogether fit the one before us, they are entitled to much weight. They are decisive, indeed, of one thing which is important, namely: that the words in question may sometimes have a legal signification different from that which we would otherwise have been disposed to assign them. Eor the sake of consistency we must follow in the steps of those who went before us, though it be true that the track is not very clearly marked.</p>

If it be proved that a man may squeeze himself along beside the track, or dodge across at the peril of his life, it does not follow that the use of the street is free, unobstructed, and unimpeded. We hold, therefore, that under a charter like this, a railroad cannot be built on a street in such a manner as to cause any <em>material </em>obstruction. If we assume, as we do, that the clause under consideration does not entirely forbid the company from going on any street, we must also allow them to create such impediments as cannot be avoided. But those which are not absolutely <em>necessary </em>to the making and using of the railroad, are unlawful; for managers are bound to leave the street as nearly free from obstructions as they can, and for that purpose to spare no reasonable expenditure of money or <a id="p357" href="#p357" data-label="357" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*357</a>labour. If, for instance, the railroad be made above the level of the street, they must grade the rest of the street also, if that will make it better for the public accommodation. They cannot say to the city authorities, We have destroyed your street, and rendered it impassable; but we have not impeded its free use, because you can restore it again to a tolerable condition, at your own expense. Neither does it make any difference whether it be a main thoroughfare or an unimportant by-street, for this act of incorporation protects all alike.</p>

A considerable portion of one street within the present limits of Erie city is occupied almost entirely by the railroad in a manner which makes any considerable use of it for other purposes almost impossible ; and this is true, although the defendants themselves say that the street might be safely and conveniently used if it were properly graded — a duty which they left unperformed. 2. Two streets are crossed by the railroad on bridges, which are too low and too narrow for large wagons passing one another, or for a single wagon with a bulky load. 3. Two other streets are crossed on an embankment, considerably above grade, with a ditch on each side, and thus all passage along those streets, by any kind of vehicle, is as completely stopped as it could be by a stone wall twenty feet high. All these things are illegal, for the reasons given. That some of these streets are on low, wet ground, and little used, might be a sort of apology for the defendants, if we were sitting here to take excuses for the violation of the law.

If the defendants have a right to make the road on a street, they have also the right to use it when made. They may carry all the freight and passengers they can get. If the number of cars and locomotives necessary to do their business be so great as sometimes to choke the thoroughfares over which they pass, it must be remembered that the same thing would happen in a much greater degree, if the twentieth part of the business were done in carriages, coaches, and common road wagons. If the cars are suffered to stand for an unnecessary length of time, at places inconvenient to the public, the act is indictable as a nuisance, and for any want of proper care, the defendants are liable in damages to the persons injured by it. But it cannot be said that they have violated their charter in causing obstructions of this kind, unless such obstructions could have been prevented or diminished by a different construction of the road.</p>

But we are content with the compendious reference we have liiade to it, because every inch of this railroad which lies upon any street of the city is unlawful, at all events. If the defendants had begun their railroad at the place designated in their act of incorporation, they would not have interfered with any of the streets mentioned in the bill, except Ash Lane, and that-would have been crossed at a different place. When a railroad authorized to be made at one place is made at another, it is a mere nuisance on every highway it touches in its illegal course. The streets in question, not being on any route which the defendants were authorized to take, they are on them in disobedience of their charter, and all they have done there is without the shadow of authority. It is useless, therefore, to inquire how much of the inconvenience complained of might have been avoided by a better construction. It is enough to say that the railroad has no business at all to be where it is.</p>

The condition was broken, and the privilege was revoked. But if the resolution of the councils had remained in full force up to this time, it would have been of no avail here. They had no “legal power in the premises.” An act of the legislature cannot be repealed or modified by the ordinance of a city corporation. What the defendants did in disregard of the law was no less an offence against the rights of the public, because the city was in some sort <em>pwrticeps criminis. </em>If both had persisted in it, the Commonwealth’s duty would have required her to see that the rights of her citizens were vindicated against both.</p>

Of course, this is within the prohibition against obstructions and impediments to the free use of public highways. The answer to this charge is not based on any interpretation which the charter is thought to be capable of. Other grounds are taken. One defence is, that the railroad could not be made in a straight <a id="p359" href="#p359" data-label="359" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*359</a>line without taking a part of the Buffalo Road.

Equally baseless (even if true) is the other argument, that the public has suffered no injury by this act. Those public interests which lie outside of the, defendants’ charter are not committed to their: keeping. The legislature has thought proper to guard the right of the people to the free use of their own roads, by enjoining the defendants not to impede or obstruct them.

Whatever impediments are caused by the ordinary and proper use of a railroad we attribute to its construction, if such impediments could have been avoided by a different construction. The legislature said to the corporators, you may make a railroad between certain given points, and use it when made by running cars and steam-engines on it; but you must so make it that its existence and use in this way will not impede the travelling on any highway now laid out. The railroad is so made that locomotives cannot be used on it without impeding travel on a certain highway, previously laid out. Such a railroad is not constructed according to the law. If it were, the use would be proper enough.</p>

It is said that though this proceeding is conducted in the name of the state, its real object is to redress a supposed injury, which is private, or at most merely local, in its character. We are urged to look not at the flag, but at the parties who fight under it. These parties — the public authorities of Erie, and the people of the neighbourhood — enepuraged the defendants to expend large sums of money in building the railroad, and the attempt which they are now making to break it up, is denounced in the argument as an act of wanton injustice. The only party before us is the Commonwealth. We do not even know the names of the <a id="p360" href="#p360" data-label="360" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*360</a>other persons alluded to. The Commonwealth complains in due form by her accredited legal representative, the attorney-general, that one of her corporations has violated its charter. We have investigated the case and found the complaint to be true. The delinquent corporation cannot justify itself by showing that in the commission of the wrong it received aid and comfort from other persons. If the mayor and councils of Erie, or their constituents, connived at this breach of law, they were guilty of a sin, for which their best excuse is that they seem to have repented of it, and are now disposed to assist the state in bringing the other offenders to the same wholesome state of mind. It cannot be that the defendants were <em>misled </em>by the people or their officers, for they must have known that a city ordinance could not authorize what an act of the legislature forbade. No laches can legally be imputed to the Commonwealth, and in point of fact, she has been guilty of no unfairness. She spoke her will plainly in the act of incorporation, and gave it to the defendants to be a guide to their feet and a lamp to their path. They disregard it. The attorney-general proves the fact, and stands up for judgment. We cannot refuse what law and equity demand.</p>

It is very plain, also, that this company has turned almost entirely aside from this purpose to one that was not at all intended, and, with the aid of that fraudulent concern, the Franklin Canal Company’s road, they have carried out their own main purpose of forming a connexion between Ohio and New York, and have converted the intended and proper terminus of their road into little better than a water station.</p>

We heard the case fully and I may add ably argued by counsel on both sides, at Philadelphia, in July. We held it under advisement until our meeting here in September, and then gave as the result of our deliberations, an opinion that the charter had been violated by the company. It seemed to us too clear to admit of doubt that the allegations of the bill were sustained in these particulars,namely: 1. The defendants were bound by the act of incorporation to make their western terminus at or within the borough of Erie as it was in 1842; whereas it was fixed sixty perches southward of the south line. 2. Even if its location southward of the old borough had been in itself lawful, it would have been rendered unlawful by the manner in which the streets of the city were impeded and obstructed. 3. The railroad occupied the Buffalo road in such manner as to make it useless and impassable, in direct contradiction of the charter. The decree which followed this opinion could clo nothing less than reqrrire the road to be taken up at those places where it was adjudged to be illegal, and reconstructed in such manner as to conform to the requirements of the charter. We made such a decree, and there we might have stopped. In strictness our duty would have been done by simply commanding the defendants to re-locate their road so as not to violate the act of incorporation again, and leave them to disobey' it if, they dared to encounter the peril of doing so. We were not bound to tell them beforehand what new location would be lawful and what unlawful. But it was plain that a dispute like this could not be so settled; The company might commit another error, and if they did not, the attorney-general might suppose they did. In either event the contest would be renewed, and misconstruction of the charter would be made worse by misapprehension of the decree. For these reasons it was thought best that <em>we </em>should order the plan of reconstruction to be submitted to us before it was executed, giving to the counsel of the state the right to be heard in opposition; so that when it was approved the company might proceed in security, and the objection of all other parties be silenced so far as the authority of this court could silence them.</p>

The principles by which we are <a id="p364" href="#p364" data-label="364" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*364</a>to settle this question are very plain. We sit here as a judicial tribunal to administer justice according to the law of the land. The charter of this railroad company is a part of this law, made on purpose to define the rights and obligations of all parties in this business. Because tbe defendants got outside of the charter, we commanded them to repair their error cost what it might. We listened to no remonstrance grounded on the loss and trouble which it would occasion them. Their plea of policy and public benefit in opposition to law was summarily set aside. All their excuses based on considerations outside of the legislative act which gave them a corporate being were utterly disregarded. We would hear of nothing but the charter then, and we can hear nothing else now. We must give the defendants the same measure of justice that has been meted out against them. The representatives of the Commonwealth “stood up for justice and her bond;” and we awarded her all that we found nominated there, when we adjudged the defendants to have transcended their charter, and decreed that they must bring themselves within it. We will not go behind or beyond that decree, but standing directly upon it, we declare again, that if the defendants comply with their charter, we think it strange that the attoimey-general or anybody else should complain of them.</p>
    <p id="b364-4" data-blocks='[["BL_364.4",364,[284,1344,1169,1072]],["BL_365.1",365,[215,397,1168,299]]]'>The act of incorporation requires this road to be made “ from the borough of Erie.” This is obeyed when the road is made from any part of the borough. If the legislature had designated a particular spot as the <em>terminus a quo, </em>we would have ordered it to be made there. But the decree is, what it ought to be, exactly as broad as the charter, and not broader or narrower. They must start at or within the borough. By the plan before us they propose to do so, and this brings us to the point where our control of them ceases. If they had done this at first we could not have disturbed their location, and it will hardly be denied that what would have been lawful then is equally lawful now. That a company which is authorized to make a road from <em>any </em>part of a borough may make it from <em>one </em>part as well as <em>another </em>is so mere a truism that one hesitates to utter it. The discretionary right of fixing the terminus at a definite point within the limits assigned is vested by the organism of this company in the directors. We have it not. We cannot resolve ourselves into a board of directors, nor can we delegate the authority of such a board to the attorney-general and his assistant counsellors. We approve the plan laid before us by the defendants, so far as concerns the location of the terminus, because it does not appear to conflict with any law; and whatever may be our private preference for the other plans, we cannot force them on the company, simply because neither we nor the persons who made them have the legal power to do so. To all the arguments derived from the commercial interests of Erie <a id="p365" href="#p365" data-label="365" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*365</a>and of the state, we give a full answer when we say that we are here to pronounce the law and not to settle questions of policy or trade. If we had any ambiguous charter before us, equally capable of two different constructions, one beneficial and the other injurious to the public trade, we would prefer the former as being most probably the true intent of the legislature. But that is not this case; for here the charter is not in the least doubtful.</p>
    <p id="b365-6" data-blocks='[["BL_365.4",365,[217,699,1171,1381]]]'>Another objection to this location is more grave, because it bases itself on a provision in the act of incorporation. It is said that the streets would be less obstructed by taking the road down <em>to </em>the harbour than by locating it where the defendants propose. The company is forbidden to make the road so as to obstruct or impede the free use of any street. These words, taken literally and in their strongest sense, would prevent the railroad from being made on the streets at all. But we followed authority in saying they were not to be so interpreted. The defendants have the right to use a street if they take care to obstruct it as little as the nature and character of their improvement will permit, if they create no material or unnecessary impediment — no obstruction which could be avoided by any reasonable expenditure of money or labour. They cannot occupy the whole of a street and' drive the public away from it altogether. But any street which is wide enough for the railroad and the public both, may be used on the terms mentioned. This applies to all the streets — to those on the south as well as to those on the north side of the borough — to streets already built up, and to such as are laid out with reference to the future growth of the town. The defendants in their answer attempted to justify their occupancy of some of the streets by showing that they were wet, low, and little used. But we allowed this to have no legal weight whatever, and added that it made no difference whether it was a main thoroughfare or an unimportant by-street, for this act of incorporation protected all alike. Having administered this rule against the defendants, it cannot be that we are seriously expected to deny them its benefit now when it works in their favour. Their duties and the rights of the public being the same in all the streets, we cannot force them out of one and into another. Nor can we compel them to take their road where no streets are; for the privilege of locating it on streets, if certain conditions be observed, is granted to them by the charter.</p>

The defendants propose to take up a part of it and to leave another part, about 800 feet in length (which equally interferes with the Buffalo road), where it is. We cannot see how any distinction is to be made between those two portions of the railroad.. There is in fact no material difference. At both places the public travel is so obstructed that it is turned away altogether. At one the company <a id="p366" href="#p366" data-label="366" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*366</a>has made a new road, and at the other the people have found a way for themselves alongside of the road they used to travel upon. But in both cases the public is equally deprived of the use of the road. It is idle to talk of laying down a railway on the middle of a common country road, and running locomotives and cars over it constantly, without impeding or obstructing the free use of it by the public. The commonest kind of common sense forbids us to believe that such a thing is at all possible. On the broad streets of Erie — Twelfth Street is one hundred feet wide — it may be done. The clearest evidence of this being an obstruction is found in the fact that no man does use the road as formerly at the place in question. It is true that the travelled way is not far distant, and for ought we know it may be just as good and commodious. But it runs for the most part over private property which may be fenced up any day in the year. We say again that the defendants must govern themselves by the law and not by their notions of public interest. The decree commanded them to take up and remove all that part of their railroad which lies on the bed of the Buffalo road, and they must obey it.</p>

It is more like a river, whose boundaries are changed by accretion and detrition. The rapid increase of population so frequently demands an extension of the boundaries of cities and towns, that such alterations are deemed to lie in the contemplation of the legislature when making enactments, and of individuals when transacting business in relation to them.

It is conceded, and has been decided by this court, in the interlocutory decree already made in this cause, that where a city or bor<a id="p368" href="#p368" data-label="368" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*368</a>ough is made the terminus of a railroad, the whole territory within the municipal limits must be regarded as a single point, and that the terminus may therefore be established at any spot within the limits thus prescribed, according to the discretion of the company. An extension of the boundaries of the municipality is, therefore, nothing more than an enlargement of the discretionary powers of the railroad company, and cannot possibly be a violation of its chartered rights. Even if it were so, it is clear that none but the railroad company itself could complain of it. But in this case the company made no complaint. It took the Commonwealth at her word, and established the terminus within the new boundaries. This, in my opinion, was in exact accordance with the true construction of the statute, as settled by repeated adjudications. But were it otherwise, the state has acquiesced in the location, until the company has fully completed its work, and has expended large sums of money in the construction of the railroad, and in the erection of the necessary buildings for the depot. The road was in full operation, in connexion with another road running west, establishing an extensive line of railway communication from the East to the West, long before any objection was made by the Commonwealth. In addition to this, it should be remembered that the railroad company was bound, under pain of forfeiting its charter, to complete its road within a specified time. That time had expired before this bill was filed. It is now too late to relocate the road, and reconstruct it, so as to save the forfeiture; and the counsel for the Commonwealth plainly intimates a determination to take advantage of the forfeiture, unless the new location shall be so satisfactory as to induce her to waive it. The long acquiescence of the state, with full knowledge of her rights, in this large expenditure of money, made in good faith, precludes her from making objections to the location. This principle applies with irresistible force, wherever it is necessary, in order to save a forfeiture. Forfeitures are, in general, so odious, that courts of justice seize upon slight circumstances of acquiescence for the purpose of relieving against them. But there are positive acts of the state, in addition to her mere acquiescence, which preclude her from making objections to the location of the road at Erie. The Franklin Canal Railroad was connected with the Erie and North-East Railroad, at the very point now objected to, at the time the state seized and took into possession the former road. Instead of repudiating that connexion as illegal, the legislature expressly directed the governor to “ Keep it in repair and good running order, for the accommodation of the public travel and business.” This was done, and the state herself made use of the Western railroad, and derived revenues from its connexion with the other road, at the very point now complained of. This is not all: By an act of last session, the Franklin Canal Railroad has been <a id="p369" href="#p369" data-label="369" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*369</a>sold for a large price by the state herself, to the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad Company. It was the very connexion now complained of that gave the Franklin Canal Railroad its chief and almost only value. Without that connexion no such price could have been obtained for it. The sale was made without the slightest intimation in the act authorizing it, that any change was to be made in the Eastern railroad at the point of connexion. On the contrary, there was much in the act to encourage the belief that this connexion, as existing and in use at the time of the sale, was not to be disturbed. Upon the plain principles of common honesty, the Commonwealth ought not now to destroy the value of her own grant, and to deprive her own grantee of the consideration for which a large sum of money has been paid. But apart from the mere justice of the case, the act of the state, in making this sale, has a <em>legal </em>effect which should certainly bind her. The connexion between two railroads is an act which requires the concurrence of both. When a statute authorizes one company to connect with another, the authority, although in different degrees, is necessarily conferred upon both. One is to do — the other to suffer; one is active — the other passive. The sovereign, having authority over both, by ratifying the connexion as to the first, necessarily confirms it as to the last. There is no escape from this view of the case. The legislation of last session, in relation to the Western road, and the acts of the state under it, have ratified and confirmed the location of the Erie and North-East Railroad, at the point of connexion. For these reasons I was opposed to the decree which directed that part of the railroad to be broken up and reconstructed, so as to terminate within the limits of the borough of Erie, as they existed in 1842. The question now is not whether the proposed location is the most advantageous one for the interests of the city of Erie, the company, or the public, but whether it is within the powers of the company, as expounded by a majority of this court. There is no room for doubt on this subject. It is in accordance with the decree, and we have no right to exact more. A railway company has no right to act capriciously, to the injury of others; but where this is not the case, its charter constitutes it the judge of the most convenient mode of conducting its works : The London and Birmingham Railway Co. <em>v. </em>The Grand Junction Canal Co., 1 <em>Railway Cases </em>224.</p>
    <p id="b369-6" data-blocks='[["BL_369.4",369,[208,2120,1168,344]],["BL_370.1",370,[283,422,1171,1761]]]'>I come now to the alteration proposed to be made at Harbour Creek. The power to construct a railroad involves every power necessary to accomplish the object. In a country where public highways abound, it miglit be impossible to avoid crossing them. It necessarily follows that the company has the right to cross them, where they lie in the route of the railroad, doing as little injury as possible, consistent with the legitimate use of the latter. When the superior advantages of railroads are considered, and their capacity <a id="p370" href="#p370" data-label="370" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*370</a>to promote “the greatest good of the greatest number” is taken into view, it is plain that the limited travel on the ordinary roa'ds ought to make some sacrifices for the advancement of an object of such, extensive and paramount benefit to the community. It has been repeatedly decided that a railroad on a public street is not a nuisance <em>per se. </em>The inconveniences which it occasions are but the natural results of increased commerce and travel. The more a thoroughfare is used for its legitimate purposes, the greater may be the inconveniences to those who have occasion to use it. But while each is so using his privilege as not unnecessarily to annoy others, there is no legal injury to any one, and therefore no legal ground of complaint. The right to cross a public road in the construction of a railroad, is as clear as the right to construct the railroad itself. The angle at which it crosses must necessarily depend upon circumstances. It is certainly not restricted to a l-ight angle where this would require dangerous curves. Short curves in a railroad interfere with that velocity which is the main object of this description of improvement. They also endanger the lives of passengers on the ordinary roads, as well as those in the railroad cars. It is therefore of primary importance that the line of the railroad be straight. This paramount object ought to be secured, if possible, although in doing it the common roads may be crossed repeatedly, and at various angles, or even approached so near as to alarm the horses and cattle in sections of country unused to the noise of the locomotive, or to the grand and imposing spectacle of a long train of cars, filled with thousands of human beings, or freighted with many hundred tons of merchandise, whizzing past them with almost lightning speed. The idea that a railroad must be made crooked in order to avoid proximity to, or crossing an ordinary road, is one which would embarrass and impair the usefulness of this, the greatest improvement in commercial intercourse which the world ever saw. It places an object of minor importance above that which, in its tendency to promote the general benefit, is so far superior as to be altogether inestimable. It places ignorance above science, indolence above enterprise, and the minority above the majority. It is of close kindred with the doctrine that the owners of the adjacent lands have a right to pasture their cattle on the railroad track, and to compel the engineers and conductors to stop a long train of cars while they 'endeavour, by means of sticks, clods, and stones, to drive off, and keep off the cattle long enough for the train to pass in safety.</p>
    <p id="b370-6" data-blocks='[["BL_370.4",370,[290,2183,1163,260]],["BL_371.1",371,[210,431,1178,1896]]]'>I have already said that the power granted to the railroad company to construct its road between the points designated in its charter, gives it the right to cross every other road that lies in its route. It has therefore a right to cross the Buffalo road, or to run in proximity to it. In doing so it is bound to so use its privilege as not <em>unnecessarily </em>to interfere with the public highway. It <a id="p371" href="#p371" data-label="371" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*371</a>has a right to a straight line, free from unnecessary curves, elevations, and depressions. If these must exist in one or the other of the two lines of communication, common sense and the general interest of the community require that they should exist in the ordinary highway rather than in the railroad. The <em>duty </em>to do as little damage to the common highway as possible, consistent with the fair uses of the railroad, carries with it the <em>power to do such acts as are absolutely necessary to avoid such damage. </em>If the common road can be crossed <em>at grade, </em>the body of it must be so altered and constructed as to make the crossing as convenient as possible for wagons, carriages, &amp;c. If the railroad crosses at an elevation too great for this, the common road <em>may be raised to a reasonable degree by embankment, and a bridge substituted for the road; </em>or it may be depressed so as to admit of a passage under the railroad. In both of these cases the site of the road is necessarily changed, and the power to make the change has never been denied. It results from the duty imposed. It is true that these alterations in the site of the highway are <em>vertical </em>ones. But there is no difference in principle between a <em>vertical </em>and a <em>lateral </em>alteration. A change in a <em>horizontal direction </em>is as fully authorized as one in <em>a direction perpendicular to the horizon. </em>They both stand precisely upon the same principle. It follows, therefore, that where the necessities of the case require it, the highway may be removed in a horizontal direction to avoid the obstruction otherwise necessarily created by the railroad. Where the highway is so crooked as to require repeated crossings at inconvenient angles, as appears to be the case with the Buffalo road at Harbour Creek, the right to change its location in a horizontal direction flows from the obligations imposed. In performing this duty the railroad company is bound to purchase the necessary ground, to pay all expenses of construction, and all damages which may be done to private right. No evil can arise from the exercise of this power, which might not be produced by intrusting it to the Quarter Sessions ; or, as is the case in some counties, to road commissioners under special acts. All inferior tribunals are subject to the review and control of the Supreme Court, and the railroad corporations of the Commonwealth are expressly made subject to the “ supervision and control” of the same tribunal. So that if they abuse their power by improperly or unnecessarily changing the location of a public highway, or by the defective reconstruction of it when changed, an ample remedy has been provided by law. The final confirmation of the road, as changed, is decided by the same power that finally establishes the location of all other public highways, by whomsoever laid out.</p>

The company appears to have acted in good faith under the belief that its acts were authorized by law. It has, so far as I am able to judge, substituted a more convenient road for the one which has been interfered with by the railroad. A large expenditure of money has been made in the construction of one of the best and most extensively useful railroads in the Union. During the time that the company was expending its money in the reconstruction of the Buffalo road, and in the construction of the railroad, the Commonwealth interposed no objection, and the public have adopted and are travelling over the new highway. There has been a long acquiescence in the action of the railroad company. The unauthorized and irregular proceedings of the excited population, in destroying the railroad structures, cannot be regarded as protests by the Commonwealth, which take away the effect of her silence and acquiescence. It has been properly said that, in deciding this case, we are not to look at the action of the local population, or of their authorities, but at <em>the flag under which they are now making battle. </em>They are in the field under the banner of the Commonwealth, and the rights of the state are the only rights which she can enforce in the present proceeding. The assent of individuals, or even local authorities, cannot legalize, nor their dissent invalidate, the location of the railroad.</p>

But if the Commonwealth merely complains of a defect of authority in the company to change the site of the highway, and desires on that ground to break up the railroad, although the change has made the public road better than it was before, she is too late. Such an application, on mere technical grounds, could not be granted after such a long acquiesence, and so much money expended, without objection, and in good faith: 1 <em>Railway Cases </em>436 ; 18 <em>Ves. </em>515; 2 <em>Dowl. P. C. </em>519 ; <em>Shelford on Railways </em>441. But a majority of the judges of this court have taken a different view of this question, and it has been decreed that the railroad must be broken up and reconstructed, so as not to interfere with the Buffalo road at Harbour Creek. The question now is, does the alteration proposed avoid the interference in accordance with the decree ? I think it does. The railroad company has <a id="p373" href="#p373" data-label="373" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*373</a>been driven by judicial interpretation upon the breakers, and I am unwilling to force it further out of its course than the necessity of the case requires in order to avoid them.

But it is clear that we have no authority to control the company further than to confine it within the limits of its charter. We have therefore no right to deprive its directors of the discretion reposed in them by law; and we cannot compel them to adopt the locations recommended by the authorities of Erie. On this part of the case I fully concur with the Chief Justice in the opinion just delivered. The result is, that the railroad has been seriously injured, and the company put to great expense, while the citizens of Erie have entirely failed in securing the object of their exertions. The change of location thus forced upon the company, will produce no advantage whatever to any one, and least of all to the people of Erie. If this decree could be forgotten, like a judgment in an ordinary personal action, I should feel less mortification at the result. But, in impairing the usefulness of this great thoroughfare of the western world, we have erected a lasting monument.

Here was a most important dispute, involving on the one hand the probable ruin of two railroad companies, and on the other a very great amount of local glory to the town councils. The companies professed to be confident in the legal foundation of their claim. The very learned and highly respectable counsel for the city candidly admitted before us that the question was doubtful. And how did the councils propose to settle this doubtful right ? By main force; by the unerring law of the strongest; by the convincing argument of blows and knocks; by the profound logic of pulling down bridges and tearing up rails. Do they expect us to approve of this? Not they. It would surprise them as much as others to find us sanctioning anything of the sort.

In the best aspect, it was anticipating the decision of the proper judicial authorities. Considerations which we could not disregard without setting a precedent which we deemed dangerous in another way, made us powerless to restrain the councils and their adherents by any direct interference between them and the Western company. Then it was that the simple plan was suggested from the bench of extending the time allowed the Eastern company to change its track. This at least was within our power. If the new connexion must be prevented by force, the old one might be preserved by law until the rights of the parties could be ascertained and determined.</p>
    <p id="b377-5" data-blocks='[["BL_377.4",377,[191,1303,1163,86]]]'>A motion to that effect was made by the counsel of the companies. It was opposed not only with ability but with some ardour.</p>
    <p id="b377-6" data-blocks='[["BL_377.5",377,[190,1390,1166,299]]]'>The city of Erie and its representatives were not content that there should be any connexion at all. It seemed a part of their specific object to do the companies as much mischief as possible, while the questions between them were still <em>subjudiee </em>and the right unsettled. Perhaps this was natural in men whose passions had been heated by a long and fierce contest in which they had suffered some wrongs. But it was not for us to gratify them.</p>
    <p id="b377-7" data-blocks='[["BL_377.6",377,[191,1690,1169,471]]]'>When a bill in equity is filed, it becomes the unquestioned right and plain duty of the court to keep the subject-matter of the dispute as nearly as possible in <em>statu quo. </em>Here the important matter was the connexion of the roads. We found the two companies in the possession of a continuous railroad. The object of one party was to break it up — that of the other was to preserve it. Which had the right it was impossible for us to say before a final hearing. Until then we simply let it stand as it is. In due time it will be broken, if an Act of Assembly cannot be produced giving the right in plain terms. Otherwise the company will be protected, as it ought to be.</p>
    <p id="b377-8" data-blocks='[["BL_377.7",377,[234,2161,1124,44]]]'>Against this course two points were pressed in the argument:—</p>
    <p id="Acr" data-blocks='[["BL_377.8",377,[191,2204,1172,177]],["BL_378.1",378,[296,376,1161,92]]]'>1. That we had no authority to relieve the Cleveland, Painesville and Ashtabula Railroad Company, by making an order in another case against the Erie and North-East Railroad Company. 2. A part of the latter company’s railroad being pronounced illegal <a id="p378" href="#p378" data-label="378" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*378</a>and a nuisance, to give time at all for its removal is wrong, improper, and without the sanction of the law.</p>
    <p id="b378-4" data-blocks='[["BL_378.4",378,[287,464,1171,856]]]'>The first of these propositions is not supported by any authority or precedent. It is not embodied as a rule of practice in any case of procedure that we know of. Nor is there any principle of justice, convenience, or policy which requires us to adopt it. Two railroads are threatened with ruin — it may be undeserved ruin — which ought to be averted at least until their doom is legally pronounced. They are before the court in separate proceedings. Our hands are tied in one case, but in the other we have full power. We are asked to make an order in the latter case, and it is objected to, because it will effectuate the whole pur.pose too well. The argument in substance is, that we must wrong both for fear that both may be righted. It would be very unfortunate if our consciences could be touched in that way. The more ground the order may cover, the more it commends itself to our best judgment: <em>Boni judiéis est ampliare jujstítiam. </em>It is the duty of every judge to make a just decree reach as'far as possible, and to give the suitors before him the fullest protection he can in the shortest way that the law has left open. The soundest decisions have done more good incidentally than they have ever done directly.</p>
    <p id="b378-5" data-blocks='[["BL_378.5",378,[294,1319,1164,1073]]]'>But it is said that we have no power to give any time whatever for the removal of an illegal railroad. In the opinion of the objecting counsel, we are interfering with the sacred rights of the people if we forbid them to abate a public nuisance whenever they please. If this be true, our whole duty was done in the present case when we ascertained the character of the defendants’ railroad. A decree for its removal was not necessary at all. We should have simply fixed the <em>caput lupinum </em>on the offending corporation — declared it an outlaw, and left it not to the forbearance of the state, but to the mercy of its private enemies. If we had adopted this view in September last, we would have stopped every car with all the passengers and freight on the road, as soon as our opinion could reach Erie by telegraph. Incalculable loss and injury would have been inflicted on thousands of persons guilty of no offence against the state except that of confiding in her justice and honour. But we were not asked to commit any such wanton and unnecessary outrage on innocent parties. It was conceded all round that we should mould our decree in the manner best calculated to enforce the law at the smallest expense of inconvenience and hardship. We allowed what time we thought reasonable under the circumstances then existing, without hearing of this objection. Afterwards, when other facts were brought to our notice, we gave more, and still the idea that we were exceeding our power had not risen to the dignity of a doubt. Now, however, it takes upon itself all the state of an argument.</p>
    <p id="b379-5" data-blocks='[["BL_379.3",379,[191,393,1167,515]]]'>
      <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>We <em>have </em>the power. Those who deny it forget that the Commonwealth, by the act of filing the bill, placed the railroad under our immediate protection, to guard the rights of all parties in interest, as well as to enforce their obligations. When a public nuisance has become the subject of judicial investigation, the power of a private citizen to remove it is gone. After that no man may touch it with the hand of violence, except in the way and at the time directed by the court having cognisance of the subject. This principle is constantly acted upon by every court of equity in the world. Two years ago it was announced by ourselves with entire unanimity; and obedience to it was enforced against the saíne parties who now again claim the privilege of disregarding it.</p>
    <p id="b379-6" data-blocks='[["BL_379.4",379,[194,908,1166,806]]]'>When it ivas regularly made to appear that the corporators of the Erie and North-East Railroad Company had violated their charter, we spoke of their acts in the strong terms of reprobation which we thought they deserved. But that decision is not authority for refusing justice to them, or to another railroad comT pany, when they happen to be right. Having once judged them according to the law, it does not follow that we must now command them to be smitten against the law. But the councils of Erie appear to be possessed of the notion that we are ready for anything they may demand. The call upon us to locate the terminus at the harbour, when the opinion was scarcely dry in which we had decided it to be legal' anywhere within the borough, was bold enough. Yet it surprises us still more to be told that we have lost, by our own decree, the power to say when or how it shall be executed; that we must disgrace the equity jurisprudence of the state by admitting that it cannot or will not provide for the safety of innocent persons, when it strikes at the wrongs of the guilty; and that its justice consists in bringing indiscriminate ruin on all alike.</p>
    <p id="b379-7" data-blocks='[["BL_379.5",379,[190,1724,1181,553]]]'>We order that the execution of the decree against the defendants in this case be suspended until the existence or non-existence of the right to form the connexion be ascertained on the hearing of the bill already filed for that purpose by the other company. Of course, this order will be revoked if the bill be not prosecuted with all due diligence. But we make it with the utmost confidence that it is necessary and proper. It will prevent mischief which, if once committed, could never be repaired; it will leave all parties at the final hearing in the same position they were at the beginning. of the dispute; it will enable us then to do, without difSculty, the justice which might otherwise be impossible; and it will save the councils of Erie, themselves, from the dangerous consequences of their own rash and unadvised behaviour.</p>
