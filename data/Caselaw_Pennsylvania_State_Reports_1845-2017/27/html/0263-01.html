If the defendant below wishes to raise objections to the declaration before verdict, he must do so by demurrer. If he neglects that course he may move in arrest of judgment. In that stage of the cause many defects are cured by the verdict. In this case the declaration is perfectly good after verdict. It is not necessary to set forth the imputation of larceny with the particularity necessary in an indictment for that offence.</p>
