On the-27th August, 1855, upon the petition of the ward, Clara Hunter, then between fourteen and fifteen years of age, the court allowed her to make choice of William C. Campbell as her guardian, and appointed him to that office. This was done without notice to appellant. He, on the 23d June, 1856, presented his memorial, setting forth the facts touching the matter, and praying the court to vacate the appointment of Campbell to the office of guardian: whereupon, a rule to show cause, &amp;e., was granted.

But if no choice be made, the guardian first appointed remains guardian until the ward arrives at the age of twenty-one years.’ And in a note on the same page it is said, that the right of an infant to elect a guardian at the age of fourteen exists by the common law, and in most if not all of the states.’ This we apprehend to be the law, and the error into which the petitioner has fallen, is in confounding a guardian appointed by the Orphans’ Court, and one appointed by a Court of Chancery. The king as <em>pater patrice </em>is universal guardian of all infants, idiots, and lunatics, who cannot take care of themselves, and the king may, ás he hath done, delegate that power to his chancellor; and therefore in England the Court of Chancery is the only proper court which hath jurisdiction in appointing and removing guardians; and in <em>Palm. </em>252, it is said, that if a guardian be made by writ out of the' Court of Chancery, or by the directions of the court, his authority cannot be revoked by the infant: 4 <em>Bacon [Bouvier) </em>549.</p>

They proceed on the same principles in matters within their jurisdiction, but it requires an Act of Assembly to give them jurisdiction. Hence, without the power given by law to appoint guardians, this court would have no jurisdiction, and its power in the premises is limited to the grant. This we think á full answer to that case.</p>

No question was made in the case as to the right of choice, nor does it appear that the minors had, at the time of the application, attained the age of fourteen.

Rut this case of Nicholson’s Appeal does, in effect, decide that a guardian cannot be removed except for causes set forth in the act. This being the case, it is of the utmost importance that a minor should have the right of choice, and be able to supersede his guardian when he arrives at the age of discretion.</p>

It is sufficient to say, that this was a case of testamentary guardian. This kind of guardianship is allowed by virtue of the statute of the 12 Car. 2, chap. 24, the 7th and 8th sections of which are in force in this state. The power to appoint testamentary guardians is also given by the Act of 8th April, 1833. The duration of this guardianship is only limited by the minority of the infant, or the discretion of the testator. Hence, it was very properly decided, that the Orphans’ Court had no jurisdiction of the petition for the appointment of a guardian for a minor, while there was a testamentary guardian, who had neither resigned nor been removed, and whose trust was limited only by the minority of the infant.”</p>

Sir William Rlaclcstone says that guardians in socage, like those for nurture, continue only till the minor is fourteen years of age; for then, in both cases, he is presumed to have discretion so far as to choose his own guardian 1 <em>Bl. Com. </em>462. Where the Court of Chancery appoints a guardian, such guardianship doth not cease on the ward’s attaining fourteen unless another guardian be then appointed; and so it is of a guardianship in socage, though at that age the ward hath a right to choose another guardian: King <em>v. </em>Pierson <em>et al., An</em>

      <em>drews’ Rep. </em>313. In <em>Reeves’ Domestic Relations </em>321, it is stated that “ When the court appoints a guardian, to an infant under the age of choice, the infant when he arrives at that age (and I presume at any time after) may appear before the court of probate and choose a guardian, which choice will be sanctioned or not as the discretion of the court shall direct. But if no choice be made, the guardian first appointed remains guardian until the ward arrive at the age of twenty-one years.” This is a correct statement of the established practice in the Orphans’ Court under the Act of Assembly. It is not understood as authorizing the minor over fourteen to supersede the guardian of his own selection as often as his fancy changes. He is only authorized to choose a guardian in the place of the one appointed for him by the court when he was too young to choose for himself. This construction leaves ample scope for the operation of the Act of Assembly relative to the removal of guardians for cause, shown. The general remarks of the judge who delivered the opinion in'Nicholson’s Appeal, 8 <em>Harris </em>53, apply altogether to removals for cause where the minor is either not old enough to exercise his right of choice, or has already exhausted his power in that particular by a choice after he arrived at the age of fourteen. No question was raised in that case in regard to the right in question here. The reasons assigned by the Orphans’ Court in support of its judgment are sound, and its decree is affirmed.</p>
