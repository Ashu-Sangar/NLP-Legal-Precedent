    <p class="summary" id="b284-7" data-blocks='[["BL_284.6",284,[296,699,1165,430]]]'>Proceedings were instituted against Bryan, Kennedy &amp; Co. before an alderman, under the act relating to sealers of weights and measures, of 15th April, 1845, in order to recover the penalty of $5 for the alleged violation of that section of the act that provides for the annual testing of scales and weights by'the regulator. Upon the oath of one R. S. Lynch, that defendants refused to have their scales and weights tried, the alderman imposed a fine of $5, and from his judgment defendants appealed. No further record evidence appears. It is stated that the court affirmed the judgment of the alderman.</p>

True, we have the transcript of the justice of the peace on our paper-books, but the last we hear of the case from this trans-script is that it was taken to the Quarter Sessions by an appeal. Here the case ends, so far as we have any record evidence. In the statement of the case in the paper,book, it is said to have been decided in the Quarter Sessions adversely to the plaintiff in error. But how it was tried after the appeal, whether by the record, or the introduction of testimony which did not appear upon the record, is left entirely to be conjectured. As a matter of course, we will riot' say that the Sessions committed an error until it is so made to appear.</p>
