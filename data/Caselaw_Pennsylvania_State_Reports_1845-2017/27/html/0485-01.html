We are of opinion that there is. The proof, if believed by the jury (and its truth is for them), goes to show that Peter Showers, the putative testator, on the 1st of September, 1852, was labouring under a mortal illness, of which, in a few hours after, he died: that he was, however, of sound and disposing mind and memory; that he sent for Mr. Heller to write his will, and also for witnesses of his own selection to attest it; that he dictated the terms and provisions of his will to the scrivener, who took them down in his presence, and read the memorandum to him, when he pronounced it to be all correct and as he wished it to be; that the scrivener then drew out the will in conformity with this note or memorandum, and read it to the testator, who expressed his approbation of it in the presence of Mr. Wismer; that the witnesses, McCarty and Rohrer, were called in, and testator proceeded to sign the will, he then lying in bed. That he sat up in bed, a bandbox was placed on the bed before him, the will laid on that, testator took a pen and proceeded to sign it, but failed through no physical or mental disability, but because the top of the bandbox yielded too much to the pressure of his arm, so that he could not write upon it. That he was then assisted out of bed and placed in a chair beside a table, with the will before him; that, in reply to an inquiry by Mr. Heller whether he would be able to write or to sign, he answered in the affirmative; that <a id="p487" href="#p487" data-label="487" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*487</a>he then put on his spectacles, took the pen, tried it on another piece of paper, and, after making with it the letter P., he suddenly sank into a state of complete physical as well as mental prostration, from which he never rallied, but died in eight or ten minutes afterwards, having never, from the moment of his sudden seizure, been in a condition either to sign himself or direct any one else to do so for him.</p>

As this will is not subscribed in either way, the question will be, was it prevented by such extremity of last sickness as the act contemplates ?</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b487-7" data-blocks='[["BL_487.5",487,[195,1084,1166,1329]]]'>“ I take it, that when and so long as a man has the physical power and ability to affix his own signature, however serious his illness, he is not bound to call in the aid of another, but that his name subscribed by his own hand is in such case the signature the law contemplates; and that if, whilst engaged in the act, but before completion, such physical power is suddenly and unexpectedly taken from him and he is surprised by the extremity of death, with no interval in which the express direction to another to sign for him could be given, the case then comes within the exception and saving of the act. And this view is sustained by the remarks of the late Chief Justice Gibson, in Cavett’s Appeal, 8 <em>W. S. </em>25, where it is plainly intimated that, by a liberal interpretation of the Act of 1833, viewing it as a remedial one, intended to meet the difficulties arising under the Act of 1805, and also for the purpose of preventing the subversion of a wholesome principle of the law of evidence, the right to call on another to write his name, only arises upon the personal inability of the testator to do it for himself. But, even supposing this not to be so to the full extent, but that the meaning of the act is, that the testator may exercise a choice between the two modes according to his caprice or fancy, still he may with equal legal propriety choose either, with as good claim to fall within the saving of the act in the one case as the other. Both acts cannot be simultaneously done, for then the idea of choice is excluded. Choice implies priority as well as preference. Where death or disability supervenes before the completion of the act, why should the will be inoperative in the one case more or sooner than in the other ? Or does the case only come within the exception when both alternatives, no matter which is first embraced, have been ineffectually tried ? Surely, this cannot be the construction of the act in question.</p>

By that section it is required that “ every will shall be in writing, and, <em>unless the person malting the same shall he prevented hy the extremity of his last siclcness, </em>shall be signed by him at the end thereof, or by some person' in his presence, and by his express direction.” The commissioners in their report state that as “ cases may arise, in which the testator may have given full and complete directions for the drawing of his will, which has accordingly been put in writing in his lifetime, but in consequence of the extremity of his last sickness, he may have been prevented from signing it, or <em>giving directions for that pur</em>p<em>ose, we have excepted such eases from the provision, and left them to stand upon the present lawHood on Fx'ors. </em>12.

The case before us is one of this character. The testator was neither able to sign it himself, nor to request another to sign it for him, and that inability was caused by the extremity of his last illness. Under these circumstances, the will, if otherwise established, was good without these formalities. The construction contended for by the plaintiff in error, would be contrary to the intentions of the commissioners, as declared to the legislature, when they reported the act, and equally at variance <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>■with the exception plainly expressed in the act itself.
