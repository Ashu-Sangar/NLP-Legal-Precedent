Grant that there is nothing in the Constitution that demands that the legislature should provide for consequential damages, still justice requires it, and it is always done, both for state and company improvements, unless omitted by mistake; for it is not for the purpose of assuring to improvement companies any part of the state’s immunity from action, but from the necessity of the case, that special tribunals and modes of trial are provided for such cases.</p>

In an English case, Lee <em>v. </em>Milnor, 2 <em>Mees. W. </em>824, under a clause authorizing compensation for “future temporary or perpetual continuance of recurring damages,” it was held that' no contingent or imaginary damages, which may never occur at all, could be allowed, and that the cause of the injury that could justify any, must exist in some work of the company from which an injury is certain to accrue, and which furnishes the, elements of a calculation.</p>
    <p id="b105-6" data-blocks='[["BL_105.5",105,[193,1548,1166,345]]]'>In the charter of this company the compensation to be allowed is “for the damage done or likely to be done,” or for the damages that “ have been or may be sustained,” taking also into account “the advantages and disadvantages,” and we cannot. doubt that the compensation intended is to be sufficient to cover'all the damage actually sustained by the construction of the road, whether direct or consequential, and without the shield of the state’s immunity from action as against any part of it.</p>
    <p id="b105-7" data-blocks='[["BL_105.6",105,[193,1893,1166,428]]]'>The law, therefore, provides for the future: “ damages likely to be done.” But this is susceptible of a very obvious explanation, and that is, that the law was providing for an assessment of damages before the work should be constructed; and therefore this form of. expression was necessary in providing for any damage, direct or consequential; and it does not necessarily imply damage that is speculative and imaginary. And besides it is a very proper mode of including those permanent and continuing inconveniences that are always apt to follow such improvements, arising from embankments, deep cuts, obstructions of roads, &amp;c.</p>
    <p id="b105-8" data-blocks='[["BL_105.7",105,[194,2322,1164,86]],["BL_106.1",106,[285,389,1166,472]]]'>Is it reasonable to infer that remote and contingent ’ future damage, such as accidental fire from locomotives, was intended to <a id="p106" href="#p106" data-label="106" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*106</a>be estimated and paid for ? We think it is not. We find no Act of Assembly that indicates that such a thing was ever thought of. The legislature never had anything like it in its mind when providing for public improvements. The law proclaims its general rule, that it has no remedy for merely accidental injuries; and when providing for the construction of internal improvements, it has uttered no new one. It has given no compensation for the risk of bridges burning or falling, lock or toll-houses taking and communicating fire, stationary engines exploding, locomotives running off the track into a man’s house, dams and locks giving way and inundating his land, or anything of that kind.</p>
    <p id="b106-6" data-blocks='[["BL_106.4",106,[286,861,1165,513]]]'>And why should it ? If it takes a man’s land or injuriously affects his property by the improvement, it gives him full compensation according to the best estimate that it is competent to obtain; and why should he have more ? True, his risks may be increased by the improvements ; but so is it with every man along the road, even though his land be passed without touching it, and why should one be paid, for the risk and the other not ? In going along streets, the locomotives may pass under the very eaves of a thousand houses without paying in advance for the risk. The improvement increases the risk; but so does improvement by the erection of mansions, and especially of all sorts of steam works, but no one gets compensation for such risks.</p>
    <p id="b106-7" data-blocks='[["BL_106.5",106,[286,1374,1164,173]]]'>It is a simple law of nature, that he who lives in society must take the risk of those social accidents which society knows not how to prevent. The incidental hazards must stand as balanced by the incidental benefit of the social state.</p>
    <p id="b106-8" data-blocks='[["BL_106.6",106,[285,1546,1166,514]]]'>It is also relevant to this question of reasonableness to ask how the risk is to be measured ? There may be but a single shanty on the land of the claimant, and if we are to provide for future risks, the duty is not satisfied by merely ascertaining the risk of the shanty, for there may yet be a hundred houses there: how can it be told how many, or of what kind or value ? And who can calculate the chances of accidental fire? We know not yet the kind of fuel that may be used; nor the improvements to be made for preventing the emission of sparks; nor how soon there will be another element than fire and steam for locomotive power, nor whether there will be one or one hundred locomotives daily along the road.</p>

The present case is an illustration of their uncertainty; for the risk of this barn is estimated at half its value, when most likely it could be shown by experience that not one erection in a thousand along a railroad is burnt in a year. If all houses near to the <a id="p107" href="#p107" data-label="107" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*107</a>track of proposed railroads had to be paid for at this rate, no railroads could be made.</p>

We desire to leave that case as little affected by the point here decided as possible; for it does not stand on the very same ground, since, there, the road was to be made before the damages were assessed, and yet there were to he damages for inconveniences “likely to result.” But still we may be indulged in saying that it seems to us that the point for which that is cited did not arise there. That was an action for negligence, and the learned President of the Common Pleas held that, if the railroad company caused the accident, they must disprove negligence, and for this the judgment was reversed, though the principle seems to be sustained by the opinion of Gibson, C. J., in another case: <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Rawle%2025" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="4 Rawle 25">4 <em>Rawle </em>25</a>.
