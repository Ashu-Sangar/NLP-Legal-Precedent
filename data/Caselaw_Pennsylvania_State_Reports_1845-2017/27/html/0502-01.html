Wood. By the Act of 26th March, 1851, the commissioners of the district of Moyamensing were directed, without delay, to regulate, curb, and pave the Gray’s Eerry road, in that district, and to charge the expense of curbing and paving to the owners of property fronting on it. The contract for the paving was allotted to Matthew Thompson, who, by his contract with the commissioners, was to look entirely to the owners-of the property fronting on that avenue for payment. The work was begun in June, 1854, and finished in December of the same year.</p>

The power to permit amendments in the names of parties is conferred upon the courts by the 2d section of the Act of 16th April, 1846, <em>Purdon, </em>p. 38, and the grant of the power implies the duty to exercise it in a proper case. The mistake, says the act, may be shown by “ <em>any sufficient, evidence,” </em>and that which ought to satisfy, is sufficient. The consolidation of the districts into one municipal corporation, proved by public statutes, was sufficient evidence that the name of one of the parties had been merged since the cause of action originated, and it followed, as an inevitable inference, that it was a mistake to place that name, no longer in existence, upon the record. Slighter evidence of the misnomer would have justified the court in removing the only obstacle in the way of parties so anxious to try their cause upon its merits. The amicable action and the pleadings show that they meant to stand on no technicalities, and the court having power to put the record into shape, should have done so, and given them a free course to justice.</p>
