    <p class="summary" id="b325-9" data-blocks='[["BL_325.8",325,[220,1009,1167,770]]]'>This was an action of debt brought on a policy of insurance by Orton Frisbie against the Fayette County Mutual Fire Insurance Company. The policy was for $1500 upon a stock of dry goods and groceries destroyed by fire on the night of the 14th January, 1852. The only question in this case arises on the description of the property contained in the application of the plaintiff to the company for insurance, which was copied by the secretary into the policy. That part of the application material to the case is as follows: “ Application of Orton Frisbie, of Dunbar township, in the county of Fayette, for insurance against fire by the Fayette County Mutual Fire Insurance Company, for the sum of $1500, to wit: on his stock of merchandise, to wit, $1200 on dry goods kept in a frame plastered storehouse, 24 by 24 feet, 1J stories high; merchandise kept on the first floor, and groceries in the storeroom and cellars: said store attended by applicant and clerk; <em>clerk sleeps in the store ; </em>one stove in said store-room; pipe secured by crock through ceiling, and brick chimney through roof; about 50 feet from a frame stable.”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b325-10" data-blocks='[["BL_325.9",325,[225,1780,1163,217]]]'>It was contended by the defendants that the words “ clerk sleeps in the store” were a warranty; and that, as no clerk was sleeping in the store on the night the fire occurred, the policy was forfeited. Plaintiff contended that the words were but a representation, and did not affect the policy.</p>

But neither of these propositions is universally true, for many warranties are implied, and the description of the subject-matter insured is very commonly attended by mere representations concerning the condition of things; and these representations are often, by reference, made part of the policy, though <a id="p327" href="#p327" data-label="327" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*327</a>actually written only in the application: <a href="/ny-super-ct/2/0632-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Hall 632" data-case-ids="1361699" data-case-paths="/ny-super-ct/2/0632-01">2 <em>Hall </em>632</a>; <a href="/wend/16/0481-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="16 Wend. 481" data-case-ids="2149124" data-case-paths="/wend/16/0481-01">16 Wend. 481</a>.</p>

If it relates to a fact that we can know, judicially, to increase the risk, as in the numerous cases of the false assumption of a neutral national character for a ship in time of war, then it is treated as a warranty. And so it is where it is apparent that the statements refer to the precautions taken to prevent fire: <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Metc.%20114" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="8 Metc. 114">8 <em>Metc. </em>114</a>: but even they are entitled to a liberal interpretation, and call only for a substantial performance according to the customs of trade and business: 1 <em>Moody &amp; M. </em>90; <a href="/ny-super-ct/1/0226-01" class="citation" data-index="11" data-cite="1 Hall 226" data-case-ids="1363450" data-case-paths="/ny-super-ct/1/0226-01">1 <em>Hall </em>226</a>; 2 <em>Id. </em>589; <a href="/wend/6/0623-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="6 Wend. 623" data-case-ids="2007481" data-case-paths="/wend/6/0623-01">6 <em>Wend. </em>623</a>; 25 <em>Id. </em>374.</p>

As he might need fire and candle there, it may be that his sleeping there would increase the risk, or be so regarded. It may be a mere license : 1 <em>Sumn. C. C. R. </em>435. We may illustrate the impossibility of the arbitrary construction contended for by changing the sentence and making it read —clerk cooks his victuals in the store. It would hardly be insisted that he should continue to do so, for this would increase the risk. Or let it read — a tavern is kept in a part of the house. This would not be regarded as a warranty that he should continue to do so; for the by-laws show that the company regarded such a use of the house as adding to the risk.</p>
