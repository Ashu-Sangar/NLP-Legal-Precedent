Beigart a lot of ground with a foundry and other buildings erected on it, in the city of Lancaster, to secure the payment of $6000. The premises afterwards were conveyed to O. 0. M. Caines, subject to this mortgage.</p>

The property was assessed with taxes in the name of Caines for the years 1858 and 1854, amounting together to the sum of $144.45. For these taxes the personal property of Snavely, Longenecker &amp; Co., found upon the premises, was seized, and to prevent a sale thereof, they paid the taxes under protest.</p>

The proceeds of the sale having been ruled into court, it was decreed that the taxes paid by Snavely, Longenecker &amp; Co. should be refunded to them out of the same, and the balance be paid to E. 0. Beigart, Esq., the mortgagee. From this decree Gormley and Briggs, the mortgagors, appealed.</p>

      <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>Assignments of error: 1. The court erred in directing any part of the proceeds of sale to be refunded to Snavely, Longenecker &amp; Co. for taxes. 2. The court erred in supposing that, because these taxes were a lien upon the premises, therefore they ought to be refunded out of the proceeds made to pay a prior lien, to the persons who owed the taxes and had paid them.</p>

Taxes are made a lien for security against the property taxed, but that lien cannot override liens upon the land existing before the taxes were assessed upon it. If Reigart’s mortgage could be impaired by a subsequent lien, nobody would be safe in his vested, rights of property. The legislature could not have intended so, unless they intended to do a wrong flatly unconstitutional. If Reigart could not be affected, there is still less reason why Gormley &amp; Briggs should be injured. They had sold, and conveyed and parted with the property long before the taxes were even assessed. They were not assessed against them; they did not owe them, and had not paid them, and cannot be made to pay them either directly or indirectly, as is now attempted. If Snavely &amp; Longenecker, as tenants of Caines, have paid taxes, their right and remedy is against Caines, their landlord.</p>

The mortgagors afterwards sold out to Caines, who went into possession, and leased a part of the premises to Snavely, Longenecker &amp; Co. The last-named parties were in possession when the taxes for 1853 and 1854, amounting to $144.85, were assessed, and as tenants they were' compelled to pay them, though by their contract with their lessor, Caines, it was his duty to discharge them. The property was sold under the mortgage (which was dated in 1851), and when the proceeds were brought into court for distribution, it was decreed that Snavely, Longenecker &amp; Co. should be reimbursed the taxes they had paid in preference to. the mortgagor, who, in the opinion of the Common Pleas, was entitled only to the balance.</p>

He paid a tax on the mortgage itself, and he certainly is not bound also to pay what was assessed on the mortgaged premises.</p>
    <p id="b51-7" data-blocks='[["BL_51.5",51,[212,1088,1164,247]]]'>Probably the mortgagors were personally liable for the debt, and if they were, the taxes would eventually come out of their pockets. But neither were the mortgagors liable for those taxes. They had conveyed their whole estate and interest in the lot to Caines, and given him full possession long before the taxes accrued.</p>

It may be true that they had all the rights, and were entitled to all the remedies, of a surety against the principal debtor. But who was their principal ? Certainly Caines, if any body; for he was the person who was bound in law and equity to pay what they were compelled to pay for him. That they have a just claim upon him to be refunded the sum they are out of pocket, does not prove that they can make others pay it, to whom they stand in no such relation.</p>

Liens are to be paid according to their priority, apd the mortgage is several years older than the taxes. The legislature might give a lien for taxes a preference to all others-; but this has not been done. The law says that certain taxes shall be a lien merely, and that does not authorize us to say that it is more than any other lien, taking grade according to its date.</p>
