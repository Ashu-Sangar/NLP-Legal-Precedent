The deposition was not signed by the witness, and the justice before whom it was taken proved that she appeared well enough to attend court, although she stated it was not safe in her “present health to attend;” that he did not write down all she said to defendant’s cross-examination, because he the justice did not think it essential, nor did he write down her testimony as, or in the language she gave it. Defendant objected to its admissibility, the objection was overruled and exception sealed, and the deposition read. It was in reference to the $50 paid by plaintiff to defendant. .</p>
