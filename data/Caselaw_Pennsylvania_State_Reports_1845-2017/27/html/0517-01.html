The case of Bowman <em>v. </em>Taylor, 2 <em>Ad. </em>&amp; <em>El. </em>278, is directly in point. The articles sued upon in that case recited that “ <em>the plaintiff had invented and obtained a patent for certain improvements in the construction of looms,” </em>the defendant covenanting to pay a certain royalty to “use and have the benefit and advantage of the said invention.” He afterwards pleaded that the plaintiff was not the original inventor ; the plaintiff demurred, and the demurrer was sustained by the whole court, on the ground of estoppel.'

On this part of the case, the recent case in the House of Lords, Baird <em>v. </em>Neilson, 8 <em>Clark &amp; Finelly </em>726, is in point. The defendant there had taken a license to use plaintiff’s patent for smelting iron by heated air; and covenanted to pay one shilling per ton on all iron that should be smelted by heated air in any of the modes theretofore applied, &amp;c. In an action to recover this royalty, the defendants alleged that the patent was invalid, and that they had not used plaintiff’s process. But the court below held the defendants precluded from such a defence, and the House of Lords affirmed the decision. The covenant in this case is stiff stronger.</p>
