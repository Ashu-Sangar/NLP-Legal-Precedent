The acceptor writes his name as acceptor without designating any place of payment. This, we think, is no designation of the place of payment, and is certainly no evidence o'f either residence or place of business at that place, particularly in opposition to the uncontradicted affirmative evidence, that that was neither his place of residence or business. It is true the notary, Leslie Irvine, calls it his place of business, but in his cross-examination explains it very clearly, showing that he so called it merely from the number at the foot of the bill. These two points are therefore determined in the negative, and this determines in effect the cause with defendant. We do not say .that the number at the foot of the bill would be of no importance under any or all circumstances. When diligent and faithful search had been made for the acceptor without success, it might be, as a last resort, proper to make search for the acceptor there, and finding no information in relation to him, make demand of any one he might find there; but that is not this case.”</p>

In relation to foreign bills, the date and address are of very positive <a id="p252" href="#p252" data-label="252" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*252</a>value iu the question of presentment; for it is the difference between them that furnishes the test whether a bill is foreign or domestic, and that governs the damages, exchange, and interest upon them. A bill of exchange dated at Pittsburgh, and addressed to a citizen of Pittsburgh at Cincinnati, is a foreign bill, and the duty is to pay abroad, and not at home; and this, because of the nature of the contract, and not of the exceptions or qualifications of the rule of due diligence. Almost all the exchanges between distant points in or out of the state, are made through bankers and brokers, and when they draw upon a person in a given place, it is understood that payment is to be made there, whether it be so expressed or not. It is in fact very rarely expressed, and it Avould seem to be very unreasonable to say that the omission to express it, may have the effect of imposing upon the holder the duty of going elsewhere to demand it.</p>

Therefore, in the natural course of such transactions, the holder would be expected to carry or send a bill of exchange, so as to have it at the place of address at its maturity, so that demand may be made there. It is not until the time of demand that he is expected to look for the acceptor, and then, certainly, it is too late to go from New York to Albany to make the demand, unless due diligence after maturity be allowed in making it. Under such views, this indulgence seems to have been allowed in some cases, for making the demand: <a href="/mass/7/0405-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="7 Mass. 483" data-case-ids="1999600" data-case-paths="/mass/7/0405-01">7 <em>Mass. </em>483</a> ; 1 <em>New Hamp. </em>140; <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Wend.%20491" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="3 Wend. 491">3 <em>Wend. </em>491</a>, citing <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Smith%20%26%20H.%20223" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="2 Smith &amp; H. 223">2 <em>Smith </em>223</a>; but we think that the circumstances which excuse it at the maturity, dispense with it entirely. It cannot be answered that the holder is presumed to know the residence of the parties when he takes it, or before it matures, for this is not the custom, and it has no judicial sanction. All the cases show that proper efforts, made after dishonour, to learn the address of drawers and endorsers, and give them notice, is sufficient, and yet the instrument is negotiated on faith in them as well as in the acceptor.</p>
