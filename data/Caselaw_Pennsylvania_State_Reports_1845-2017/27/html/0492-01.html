Bones, the appellant, a minor, for whom John Morgan, the appellee, was appointed guardian, in November, 1834. The real estate of the intestate was appraised under proceedings in partition, and not having been taken at the appraisement, was sold under an order of the Orphans’ Court, for $6321.56, and the sale confirmed on the 4th February, 1836. ,One-third of the purchase-money remained charged upon the premises during the life of the widow; one-third in cash, and the balance in one year. In 1836, the administrators of the intestate filed an account, which was referred to auditors, and a balance found in their hands arising from the personal estate of $2935.56; confirmed 6th February, 1837. A supple.mental account was filed, charging themselves with $4226.36— two-thirds of the purchase-money of the real estate — and claiming credit for a bond and mortgage on the premises paid, amounting to $4103.83, and other debts and expenses absorbing the whole fund, and showing a balance due the accountants of $62.65.</p>

It was in litigation between the parties until the 19th April, 1850, when the amount due from Bones’s estate was finally adjusted at $751.75.</p>

In substance this is an action for negligence said to have arisen more than eighteen years ago, and the complainant allowed more than eighteen years to elapse after he arrived at age before instituting this proceeding to charge his former guardian with it. Though this case is not in the form of a common law proceeding, yet it is governed by the same principles as if it were, and the statute of limitations protects the guardian by prohibiting this tardy presentation of the complaint.</p>
