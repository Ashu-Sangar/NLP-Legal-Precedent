In 3.838 Jeremiah Smith, the father of the plaintiff in error, was in possession of and claimed the land in dispute. There were several judgments ,of record against him and liens upon this land. One of these was in favour of Samuel Torbett for $95.48, — on this a <em>fi. fa. </em>was issued, an inquisition held, and the land was condemned. Under a <em>ven. ex. </em>the land was sold to James Smith, defendant in error, for $440, $150 of which was paid at the time of sale, and the balance in about six months afterwards. • The sheriff then made and acknowledged his deed to James • Smith. ■ Afterwards Jeremiah Smith made a quit claim deed of the land in controversy to his son Peter Smith, the plaintiff in error. ...</p>

Jeremiah agreed to this. James sold some of his land, obtained the money, did not pay the judgment, but bought the property at the sheriff’s sale. After the sale James said he wanted no more land than Jeremiah agreed to let him have, and said he meant to do as he had agreed before the sale. James not having paid all the purchase-money, the sheriff again advertised the property for sale. James, being informed of this, had 18 acres surveyed off the tract, so as to covér the amount first paid by him to the sheriff, and then paid the balance of his bid. No effort was ever made on the part of Jeremiah either to pay or secure to James the sum he had to pay over and above the amount of the Torbett judgment.</p>

    <p id="b181-13" data-blocks='[["BL_181.13",181,[223,1819,1168,518]]]'>The verbal contract entered into between Jeremiah and James Smith, a few days before the sheriff’s sale, by which the latter agreed to buy as much land at $8 per acre as would satisfy Torbett’s judgment, passed no interest in the land. It was not in writing. No money was paid. ' No possession was delivered.. No precise location or description of the land was agreed on. Under the statute of frauds and perjuries no title whatever could possibly be acquired by virtue of such a contract. The sheriff’s sale to James Smith was not made in pursuance of the verbal contract, or under any contract between the parties whatever. There is therefore no ground for alleging that there is any contract to hold the title, or any part of it, in trust for the plaintiff.</p>

There was a legal and a moral wrong in this, for which the defendant might have been made to answer in damages. But this was the extent of his liability. Unless there is something more- than the violation of a parol agreement, equity will not decree the purchaser at sheriff’s sale to be a trustee: Robertson <em>v. </em>Robertson, <a href="/watts/9/0032-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="9 Watts 32" data-case-ids="1849959" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0032-01">9 <em>Watts </em>32</a>. The promise, after the sheriff’s sale, to carry out the verbal contract, was not upon any new consideration, and gave it no additional obligation. The court below decided the cause according to law.</p>
