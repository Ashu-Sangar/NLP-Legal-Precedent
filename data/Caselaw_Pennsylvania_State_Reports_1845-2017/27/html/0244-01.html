    <p id="b249-6" data-blocks='[["BL_249.4",249,[213,624,1165,256]]]'>These Acts of Assembly, it seems to me, have taken away distinctions that were always embarrassing, and sometimes insuperable obstacles to the course of justice. There was no difference in the duty before, and none in the remedy now. The moral obligation is not affected by the words joint and several, and in Pennsylvania at least, the legal liability is not.</p>
    <p id="b249-7" data-blocks='[["BL_249.5",249,[212,881,1168,507]]]'>If the words “ or either of us,” were therefore surreptitiously inserted in the note, making that a several, which else had been a joint contract, neither the moral nor legal effect of the instrument was changed, and the alteration was consequently immaterial. Both Reed and Christy were bound to pay, and for aught that appears, both participated in the consideration. Nay, Reed, the objecting defendant, may have been the principal debtor, and if so, there is great equity in the statute that deprives him of a sharp and technical defence. Forgery avoids an instrument; but forgery is the fraudulent alteration of a writing, to the <em>prejudice </em>of another. Reed was not prejudiced by this alteration, and therefore the note should have been admitted in evidence.</p>
