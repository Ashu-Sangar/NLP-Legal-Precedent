I told him I could not lend him the money, but would get the sales continued till he could raise it. They were continued. Felt did not raise the money, and I became the purchaser. I think the tract in suit is one of the three I bought at Felt’s request. I made the assignment at request of Mr. Felt, either in writing or in person, upon receipt of the redemption-money. Don’t recollect who I sold to; presume Gibson and Hathaway. There was nothing paid for the lands but the redemption-money. Might have given me one dollar for making the assignment.

    <p class="summary" id="b162-7" data-blocks='[["BL_162.5",162,[281,569,1163,377]]]'>“ According to plaintiff’s evidence the arrangement of Seneca Freeman with Oviatt constituted a redemption. According to defendant’s evidence it constituted a purchase. The question therefore arising upon the title of defendants derived through Oviatt are questions of fact, which, if deemed material and important, we would submit to the jury with the simple instruction that their correct determination depends upon the credibility of the witnesses. The evidence of Seneca Freeman being contradictory to that of Brewster Freeman and Wm. S. Oviatt.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b162-8" data-blocks='[["BL_162.6",162,[281,955,1164,205]]]'>“ But we deem it unnecessary to refer the question of the credibility of these witnesses to you, as the title set up by defendants derived through Wm.

    <p class="summary" id="b162-9" data-blocks='[["BL_162.7",162,[281,1170,1163,945]]]'>“ Williams purchased at treasurer’s sale for the taxes of 1848 and 1849. His deed bears date the 20th of August, 1850, and the consideration therein mentioned is $34.64. He bought at the request of Eli Felt, who had purchased the Seneca Freeman title from E. Newland on the 20th of August, 1848, and conveyed it to the defendants on the 27th of February, 1849. It is not alleged that Felt had any knowledge of any complicity between Seneca and Brewster Freeman in the procurement of the title from Oviatt, or of the circumstances now given in evidence to defeat that title. We think no substantial reason can be assigned why he might not purchase at treasurer’s sale to confirm and strengthen his own title, or why he might not procure another to purchase for him under the terms stated by Mr. Williams, and direct a transfer of the deed to his vendees for the purpose of securing their title. But even if he had known- all the facts disclosed in this trial, we conceive it would still be difficult to show why he might hot at any time abandon the defective title he had acquired, and purchase a better one, or employ some one to purchase for him. It cannot be that because he was so unfortunate as to purchase a title which had been invalidated by its transmission through Seneca Freeman, he was therefore incapacitated from acquiring a title through any other source.</p>

But he did not redeem, unless every transfer of a treasurer’s deed made before the expiration of the equity of redemption constitutes a redemption. Williams made <a id="p163" href="#p163" data-label="163" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*163</a>the transfer to Gibson and Hathaway, as he alleges, at the request of Felt, and they paid him the consideration for it. That consideration was less than the amount of redemption-money — the taxes and costs being $34.64 — the redemption-money $43.30, and the consideration paid by Gibson and Hathaway to Williams, $38.12. What is meant by the redemption of a tract of unseated land sold for taxes ? It is the payment by the owner (or some other person authorized by him) within two years after the sale; of the amount of taxes-and costs for which the'tract was sold and twenty-five per cent, in addition thereto to the treasurer of the county. A legal tender of this sum, should the treasurer refuse to receive it, and payment to the treasurer’s vendee may answer as equivalents — but a tender to the latter would not. . An agreement to buy his title is not a redemption.</p>

But who is injured by the treasurer’s sale to Williams, and the transfer of Williams to Gibson and Hathaway ? Coxe surely had no just right' to expect Felt or Williams, or Gibson and Hathaway, to pay his taxes or redeem his lands. There existed no privity of contract between him and them, and no obligation by which they were required to do so rested upon them. Nor does Williams complain that Felt took advantage'of him by representing that he had a right to redeem. On the contrary, Williams had purchased on his own suggestion under an arrangement made for Felt’s benefit, and all that he required or expected was the money he had advanced, and compensation for its use, according to the terms of that arrangement.</p>

Williams did nothing more in receiving the money he had advanced and transferring his deed to Gibson and Hathaway, than he considered himself bound tó do under his agreement with Felt. But even if he had done more, what is that to Coxe ? Williams does not complain of having been overreached- or defrauded in the transaction. He undoubtedly knew what he was doing and what his rights were — and although it might have been.his understanding that Felt was to redeem, yet Gibson and Hathaway, who paid him his money, took an assignment of his deed and not a receipt for redemption-money — and as Williams made <a id="p164" href="#p164" data-label="164" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*164</a>the assignment without objection, what right has Coxe to object and to claim that this is a redemption and not a purchase ?</p>
