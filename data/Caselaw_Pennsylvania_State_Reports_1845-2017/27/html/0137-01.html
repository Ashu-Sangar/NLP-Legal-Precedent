The Act of 1811 authorizing such sale for the balance of the final account tended to confirm the impression arising out of this case that no sale could be ordered for payment of debts <em>before settlement, </em>except where there were minors.

Secondly, it might then have been thought that the Orphans’ Court had no power to authorize the administrator to make a sale, on two grounds — one, that no administrator’s account had been settled, the other, that there were no minors requiring maintenance; and the evidence in this case shows that all the heirs were married and grown up, and, so far as it shows anything, probably all of age.</p>

Such, too, was no doubt the opinion of the parties in interest, who never seemed to have discovered the trust till after the lapse of more than the third of a century, though the facts on which the alleged trust arose, manifestly were known to them.
