    <p class="summary" id="b257-14" data-blocks='[["BL_257.11",257,[203,1671,1170,688]]]'>This was an action of covenant brought by Minor T. Carr against Sarah Lowry, administratrix of the estate of S. B. Lowry deceased, upon a sealed contract made May 22, 1844, between plaintiff and the intestate. The plaintiff, for a certain consideration, granted to the intestate, his heirs and assigns, the privilege of making and continuing in use through a lot of land belonging to plaintiff a tail race for a mill. Lowry for himself, his heirs and assigns, covenanted to keep the tail race timbered, planked, and covered over with earth, and to pay all damages thereafter caused by the passing of the tail race through the land. In June, 1848, Lowry conveyed all his interest - in the property to M. B. Lowry, who leased it to Robinson. Afterwards one Montague, under Robinson, entered upon the premises of plaintiff, opened the race, took out the timber, and left it uncovered, in which condition it remained until covered up by Carr at a cost of about $&gt;50, including the damage done to the land.</p>

In the covenant sued on, Lowry binds only his heirs and assigns after himself; and very properly so, for. he was defining and contracting for the duties that ought to be performed by whoever should be owner of the mill. We cannot presume that he intended to bind his personal representatives to such duties. In the natural order of affairs they accompany the ownership of the property to which they relate, and therefore; in the present case, ought to be performed by the heirs or assigns of Lowry, if they claim under the title then acquired by him. The relation between Carr and Lowry, on which the duty depends, was dissolved by Lowry’s death, if not before, and his administratrix can be charged to answer only for a breach in his lifetime. This view of the case •saves us from considering the other questions.</p>
