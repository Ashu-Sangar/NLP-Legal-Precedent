Gamble, against the executors of Francis McClure, deceased. The plaintiff, Gamble, was evicted from the' possession of 101 acres of land, being part of a larger tract conveyed by Francis McClure to Vm. McClure, Jr., by deed dated 30th May, 1805, containing a covenant of general warranty, for himself, his heirs and assigns. Wm. McClure afterwards conveyed the land to H. Douthett, who, by his will, devised it to Gamble during the term of his natural life. The estate conveyed by Francis McClure was the property of his wife, who did not join in the acknowledgment. After her death, her heirs sued out ejectment, recovered, and Douthett was evicted. In 1851, Gamble died, and his administrators were substituted.</p>

It is thought, that because the grantor expressly included his heirs in the covenant, he has impliedly excluded his executors; but this does not follow, for by binding himself he binds his estate, so far as it is represented by his executors, whereas the heir could not be bound without express terms, and this accords with Williams <em>v. </em>Burrell, 1 <em>Com. Bench R. </em>402. And if the heir at common law is the only one found as heir by such a covenant, the law would lean in favour of equality of contribution by preferring the action against the executors or administrators.</p>

We regard this objection as sound, and as receiving support by the reasoning of Mr. Justice Rosees, in the case of Paul <em>v. </em>Witman, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20409" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 409">3 <em>W. &amp; S. </em>409</a>; though, in that case, it was decided only that different owners may properly join. Regarding the tenant for life and the remainder-men as entitled, as against the covenantor, to one seisin and property divided as among themselves into different periods, we think that the action on the covenant given to secure that seisin ought to be single, otherwise the covenantor, not being able to set up the judgment of one against the other claimants, might have to pay to all much more than is required by his covenant, might be subjected to innumerable actions for a single breach of the same covenant.
