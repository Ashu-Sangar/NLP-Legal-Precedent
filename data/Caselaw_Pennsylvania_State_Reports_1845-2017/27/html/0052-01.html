The assignees of Jonas Klinedinst resisted the confirmation of the appraisement, and showed a judgment entered on the 4th of April, 1850, in the Common Pleas of York county, against Adam Becker, the intestate, for $120, in favour of Jonas Klinedinst. Also, one ■ in favour of John Stouffer, entered on the 14th of March, 1851, upon a note with warrant of attorney, for $28.62, and which contains this clause, “ Defendant waives all and every claim to exemption under Act of 9th April, 1849.”</p>

If Adam Becker had died after the entry of the judgment on the 4th April, 1850, and before the passage of the Act of 1850, on the 26th of the same month, there could be no question that the widow would not be entitled. But it is said there was no lien. Could Becker have sold the property free from the encumbrance of the judgment ? If not, it is because the judgment was a <em>lien </em>upon it: Bowyer’s Appeal, 9 <em>Harris </em>210. A judgment is a lien upon every kind of legal or equitable interest in land: Corkhuff <em>v. </em>Anderson, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Binn.%205" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 Binn. 5">3 <em>Binn. </em>5</a>; Thomas <em>v. </em>Simpson, 3 <em>Barr </em>60. The Act of 1849, instead of exempting the estate from the lien, makes provision for its sale, where the $300 worth cannot be 'set off to the debtor without spoiling the whole. If there is no lien, how could it be sold ? The execution gives no lien independent of the judgment: Davis <em>v. </em>Ehrman, 8 <em>Harris </em>256. In such a sale there could be no doubt about the title: Miller's Appeal, 4 <em>Harris </em>300; Brant’s Appeal, 8 <em>Harris </em>141; Hoffman <em>v. </em>McDermond, <em>MS.</em>

It is argued that it was not a lien, because under the Act of 9th April, 1849, Becker himself was entitled to a similar exemption, and the valuation shows that the land was not worth $300. But this is not sound. A judgment is a lien on every possible interest the defendant has in real estate. In this case Becker was the owner of the legal title, and his right to the exemption provided by the Act of 1849, depended on his election. By the very terms of the Act, the land might be levied on, and in case so much as he might elect to retain could not be set off to him, -the whole might be sold. The lien was subject to his statutory rights, but it was, nevertheless, a lien, and could be affected by his statutory rights only when he claimed them. He died without claiming them, and now the question is whether the lien of the judgment is affected by the legislation of 26th April, 1850. In Neff’s Appeal, 9 <em>Harris </em>247, it was said there is nothing whatever in the Act of 1850, whether construed by itself or <a id="p55" href="#p55" data-label="55" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*55</a>in connexion with the Act of 1849, which indicates the slightest intention to impair the value of liens which existed before its enactment. Surely there is not. The Act is prospective in its terms — “that <em>hereafter </em>the widow,” &amp;c. — and legislation is never to have retroactive effect, except when enjoined by the most explicit language.</p>
