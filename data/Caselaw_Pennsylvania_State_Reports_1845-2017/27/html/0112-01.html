Stees denied all these allegations, and refused to pay the bill, and Kemble brought a suit for its recovery before a justice of the peace. This became at the hearing before the justice, and afterwards, the subject of a quarrel between the parties, and a great deal of ill feeling and passion was displayed by both.</p>

In the present case the evidence was properly admitted; for, whilst it expressly negatived the larceny, it was calculated to induce a mistaken belief in the mind of the defendant that the charge was well founded. It could not amount to a justification, for in the absence of a felonious intent, when the property was received or taken, no larceny could be committed, and consequently the defendant was responsible for the words spoken; but as the extent of the responsibility, or the standard of damages, depended very much upon the degree of malice entertained by the defendant towards the plaintiff in making the charge complained of; everything which tended to rebut the presumption of malice, or lessen the extent of it, was legitimate evidence under the plea of not guilty.</p>
