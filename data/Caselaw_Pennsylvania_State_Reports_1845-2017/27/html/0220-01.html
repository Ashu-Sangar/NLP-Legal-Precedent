McCloskey, Dennis Burgoon, and others, to recover damages for taking and carrying away the property of the plaintiff. Solomon Cyphert, the father of the plaintiff, became insolvent in 1849, and his property, both real and personal, was sold by his creditors. The farm on which he lived was sold at sheriff’s sale in 1851, to Reed McClune, and on account of some irregularity in the proceedings, was sold a second time, and purchased by B. F. and J. Harley; they leased the property to a man of the name of Jacob Peas, and he transferred his lease to Henry Cyphert, the plaintiff, then a minor of about seventeen years of age. Solomon Cyphert continued on the farm with his family, which consisted of a wife and eight minor children, of whom the plaintiff was the eldest. By the aid of relatives and the neighbours loaning him such necessary articles as were essential, the plaintiff commenced farming the place in the spring of 1852, and supporting his father, who was infirm, and the rest of the family. Under his management matters went on prosperously until the winter of 1854, when the defendant, Burgoon, who had recovered a judgment against Solomon Cyphert, the father, in 1849, sued out an execution and levied upon the personal property that the plaintiff had acquired, and a crop in the ground, and had them sold. To recover damages for which, this action was brought.</p>

But this will not apply to the labour of Solomon Cyphert as against prior creditors. He had a right to dispose of it as he pleased, even to protect it from his creditors, and they could only take in execution liis tangible earnings which belonged to him, nor would the property which was given to Henry by his relatives, or the increase of the cattle be liable to the creditors of Solomon.

The jury were in effect so instructed, but they found no fact of that sort. If the son was the mere servant and agent of his father, and his pretended . ownership of the property a sham, he would have no right to complain that it was taken. But this also is negatived by the verdict. If he had even bought it from his father, paying an honest price for it, his title as against creditors might be doubtful, for want of the open delivery .and exclusive possession which the law requires to make such a transfer valid. But that was not alleged at the trial. All the property in dispute was given to the plain<a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>tiff by other persons in his own right, and the lease of the land appears to have been taken in good faith by himself and for himself. He got nothing from his father; for his father had nothing to give him; his whole offence, if he committed any, consisted in applying what he received from the bounty of his friends, and what he made by his own labour in such a manner as to rescue his parents and the younger members of the family from want. There was, therefore, no fair question of actual fraud in the case; or if there was, the verdict settled it conclusively against the defendants. Nor was it possible to raise the point of legal fraud on the ground of an imperfect purchase of goods from an indebted man. The defence can be made out only by showing that the minor child of an insolvent person cannot, even with the consent of his father, acquire property by gift, or create by his labour anything which will not go to his father’s creditors.
