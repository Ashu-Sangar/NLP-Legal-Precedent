Human ingenuity and forecast would be utterly inadequate to provide for every exigency which might arise. There must be some power somewhere to regulate these as they occur. But it is alleged that there is a necessary implication that the election to fill a vacancy shall be at the first election which occurs after the vacancy happens, because the governor is only authorized to appoint until December succeeding that time. What is the inevitable consequence of this construction ? That if a vacancy occur on the bench of this court the very day before the election, it must be filled the next— when not a thousandth part of the voters of the state would know of the vacancy, or be prepared to vote for a successor.

Indeed, it is for this very purpose the constitution establishes a legislature. Accordingly, when the convention of 1838 determined that aldermen and justices of the peace should be. elected, they enjoined, in the schedule, that the <em>legislature </em>should provide for the first and all subsequent similar elections. Another clause of the schedule enjoined that such laws as should be required by the 8th section of the sixth article of the amended constitution should be enacted by the <em>first </em>legislature under the amended constitution; but in the Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Clark, 7 <em>W. £ S. </em>127, it was held that the Act of 1843, authorizing the election of canal commissioners, was constitutional, though it was not passed by the <em>first </em>legislature that sat under the amended constitution. This shows that, both in the judgment of the constitution and of this court, such regulations for carrying out constitutional principles are éssentially legislative duties, even when the particular legislature enjoined to perform the duty has neglected it.</p>

It then goes on to re-enact the limited tenures of the judges, in the same terms in which that subject was provided for by the second section of the fifth article of the amended constitution of 1888. The first election of judges under this amendment, the dates of their commissions, and the classification of the judges of the Supreme Court, are next provided for; and then follows the only clause, relative to vacancies, in these words: “ <em>Any vacancies happening by death, resignation, or otherwise, in any of the said courts shall be filled by appointment by the governor, to continue till the first Monday of December succeeding the next general election.”</em>

Still it is only an implication, and I doubt if any Act of Assembly has ever been annulled for contravening an implied rule of the constitution. We are in the habit of saying, and our predecessors said it with great emphasis, that it must be a clear case to justify the judiciary in setting aside an Act of Assembly as unconstitutional. In the last constitutional question in this court, it was said, nothing but a <em>direct </em>collision between the provisions of the statute and those of the federal or state constitution will have this effect: 2 <em>Casey </em>801. What is meant by such expressions ? that the judiciary may set up their implications as of equal force with the letter of the organic law ? Or, that the law must be in such plain conflict with the letter of the constitution as to be apparent to every reasonable mind when pointed out ? If the former be meant, no man can tell what the constitution is from what is written, and we might as well not have a written constitution; if the latter, then this is not a clear case of <em>direct </em>conflict.</p>

What then ? The rule is a general one, prescribed, like most other constitutional rules, as a great first principle of government, to be regulated and applied by the legislature. The constitution does not attempt to apply its own principles. It lays down the principles that elections shall be free and equal, and that the right of trial by jury shall remain inviolate, but leaves the legislature to regulate elections and trial by jury according to a sound discretion. In like manner, it says judges shall be elected; and it does indeed fix the day of the general elections, and voting by ballot, but it does not say <a id="p459" href="#p459" data-label="459" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*459</a>what notice the electors shall have of the vacancies to be filled, where they shall vote, who shall receive and count their votes, nor how the result is to be certified to the governor; all which is necessary to make an orderly and fair election. Standing alone, the constitution could not effect the desired reform. It decreed the election of judges, but referred the mode to the law-making power. To secure to the people the constitutional right of election, it is necessary for the legislature to step in and arrange those details without which the general principle would be mere <em>brutum fitlmen.</em>

These laws, among other things, prescribed twenty days’ notice by sheriffs’ proclamations of the offices to be filled, and of the places to which the electors should repair to deposit their ballots. It <em>is </em>extremely probable that the legislature and the people, in adopting the amendment, referred themselves to these laws; and, suppose they did, one of two things must then be true: Either these laws were impliedly taken up and incorporated into the constitution, and became thereby part of the fundamental law, or else they remained mere laws, alterable and repealable at the will of the legislature. Nobody will contend for the first alternative, and the latter becomes the inevitable conclusion. But, if the legislature may prescribe <em>twenty </em>days’ notice of the vacancy to be filled, why may they not repeal that and prescribe <em>ninety </em>days ? And, on what principle is this court to proceed in declaring the latter law unconstitutional which would not be equally fatal to the former ? If we insist on reading the amendment as an inflexible and imperative rule that vacancies shall be filled at the <em>next </em>general election after they happen, without regard to time or notice, then the election laws in force at the adoption of the amendment are no better than the Act of 1852, for a vacancy may happen within twenty days before a general election as well as three months. Both must be swept away, and we must come down to the rule that vacancies, occur when they may, shall be. filled at the next general election; and that rule, I submit, would be impossible of execution in many cases. The electors of the state, the district, and the county are to choose the judge; but the right of choice cannot be exercised until it is known there is a vacancy to fill, nor until time is given to cast about for a fit incumbent and to canvass his qualifications. And how is a vacancy which happens the day before a general election to be notified to the electors ? If it were a vacancy on the supreme bench, or in the presidency of some of our large judicial districts, not one-half of the electors would hear of it; and, if they did, they would not be ready the next day to make <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>discreet choice of a successor. To compel them to choose at the <em>next, </em>general election in such a case, and in many cases that might be supposed, would be to sacrifice the right. A judge might resign the night before an election, and the few friends to whom alone it was known go next day and re-elect him or any other, even the most incompetent or objectionable man, to fill the vacancy — which would be a mockery of the right of popular election. Cases of the grossest imposition, such as would shock the common sense of mankind, would certainly occur, under the operation of the rigid rule which is attempted to be forced on the constitution. The elective principle, instead of being, as it was' intended to be, a concession to popular sovereignty, would become an intolerable evil; and an oppressed people would be more anxious to get rid of it than they were to plant it in the constitution.</p>
    <p id="A4i" data-blocks='[["BL_460.4",460,[299,1000,1162,902]]]'>To avert painful consequences, and to make sure of the reform designed, we have only to consider the constitution as furnishing the <em>principle </em>of government, instead of the <em>rule </em>of action. It prescribes popular elections, and leaves the legislature to regulate them. The error springs from the attempt to deduce, not ¡only the <em>principle </em>but the <em>rule of its </em>application, from the constitution. “ A constitution,” said Judge Gibson, in Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Clark, “ is not to receive a technical construction, like a common law instrument or a statute. It is to be interpreted so as to carry out the great principles of the government, not to defeat them; and to that end, its commands as to the time or' manner of performing an act are to be considered as merely directory, wherever it is not said that the act shall be performed at the time or in the manner prescribed, and no other.” So far from saying that vacancies shall be filled by election at the next’general election, and in <em>no other </em>manner, the amendment, as we have seen, does not even say that they shall be filled by election at all. When, therefore, we construct a rule by implication, of such rigour and inflexibility as to defeat the legislative regulations, we not only violate accepted principles of interpretation, but we destroy the very right which the constitution intended to guard.</p>

If it be said that extreme cases are not to be imagined to test the soundness of a rule of construction, I reply that it is not an ■extreme or improbable supposition that vacancies will occur so ■short a time before a general election as to preclude the notice, and the canvass, which are essential to the right of choice. And it is such cases that illustrate the necessity for the legislation which is complained of.

It is the very period which the constitution itself fixes for’ the selection of a governor to fill a vacancy, and was doubtless adopted in analogy to that. And is not the selection of a supreme judge for fifteen years, or of president judges for ten years, as important a duty — worthy of as much care and circumspection — as the selection of a governor for three years ? The people have a deeper stake in the judicial office than in any other, and seeing that they have secured to themselves in their constitution three months, as a reasonable time to canvass' for a governor, it would be a curious discovery in constitutional law that the same period fixed by the legislature for choosing a judge was so palpable a violation of the constitution as to make it our duty to arrest the operation of the enactment.</p>
