In 1846 they leased to A. &amp; Co., to whom the lease of 1842 had been transferred, the Q. vein on the same terms, the quantity from the two veins being increased to 15,000 tons <em>per annum. </em>In 1847 the same owners leased to H. &amp; H., who had become the holders of the former two leases the B. and S. veins, which latter never had been opened, the lessees stipulating to take 50,000 tons from the four veins if they could be made to yield that quantity. The lessors stipulated to pay for driving the gangways through dirt faults and through rock and slate faults, they being <em>“first consulted and approving by their consent in writing,” </em>and also to make a fair allowance for railroad iron and spikes for the railroads in the main-drifts, and for running the slope and doing other work necessary to open the veins, <em>“tobe deducted from the rent hereinbefore agreed to be paid.” </em>.The lessees took possession <em>and </em>expended large sums in opening the B. and S. veins, the B. vein yielding but a small amount of coal and the S. vein none. A portion of the rent for the coal mined was paid in cash, a part in houses built for the lessors, and a part remained unpaid. The lessees brought covenant on the lease of 1847, to recover the amount expended in opening the B. and S. veins, and for running gangways through dirt, rock, and slate faults. <em>Held,</em>

It is advantageous to the landlord, that he may be sure of his anticipated rent; to the tenant, that he may obtain profit on the largest possible amount of coal. Some of the veins may run into fault, whilst increased mining may be carried on in others; or, for many other reasons, preparatory work may have to be done in one vein which shall suspend mining therein, while the hands and implements for mining in that vein may be profitably employed in another. A rigid rule that should require a given number of tons from each vein, would lead to frequent disappointment and difficulty, whilst one that fixes the aggregate of all the veins, admits of adaptation to those unforeseen circumstances which in this business are always occurring. It was, we suppose, for the purpose of guarding against contingencies in one vein or another that might affect the gross 'production, as well as to make all the rents payable at one time, that this covenant was introduced into the lease of 1847; and its whole scope and effect are to be limited to these objects.</p>

Established rules of construction require all such detail covenants to be referred to the premises, unless a different reference be clearly indicated by the language used. Here there is nothing to manifest an intention to merge the former leases, and the details arranged throughout these thirteen articles cannot apply to the P. and Q. veins, for they are inconsistent in some points with the regulations prescribed by the former leases for these veins. For instance, it is covenanted in the 4th article, that the lessees will, at their own expense, make all the necessary improvements for “ opening and working <em>the said veins” </em>— a provision which it would he absurd to apply to veins al<a id="p439" href="#p439" data-label="439" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*439</a>ready opened, and in which the party promising was then actually engaged in mining.

Obviously none. Covenants, like all other contracts, are to be construed according to the intentions of the parties as nearly as the words will permit; and there is no surer guide to the understanding and intentions of the parties, when words are equivocal, than their acts and declarations under the agreement, called commonly its contemporaneous construction. The conduct of these parties, and especially their correspondence, prove that they understood the lease of 1847 as we have expounded it. We feel great confidence, therefore, in our conclusion that sections 11 and 12 have no reference whatever to the P. and Q. veins, but that improvements and work in these veins were left to stand for compensation, upon the provisions of the prior leases. It may be added, that the diversity of rents under the several leases is a strong reason against the assumption of a merger.</p>

The company seem to have provided by their several leases, that each of their coal veins should pay for its own development. And this is according to the usual course of.mining leases. The landlord has invested his money in the title of the coal land — the ténant is expected to invest his in opening and working the veins. Both look for their reimbursements to the coal to be mined; the tenant, generally, as in the instance before us, expecting the first fruits, and these to be gathered by deductions from the rent; the landlord, to obtain his rent unimpaired after the improvements have been paid for. The lease of 1847 seems to have been constructed on these general and familiar principles. But who is to bear the disappointment, when veins thus opened prove inadequate to reimburse the outlays? If the tenant may charge the expenses against the accruing rent of <em>other </em>veins held of the same landlord, he may charge the landlord personally; and then a mining lease, without an express covenant to that effect, amounts to a warranty that coal will be found sufficient to reimburse the cost of opening. <a id="p440" href="#p440" data-label="440" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*440</a>The court below held that no such covenant could be implied, and as this opinion is not complained of, we are to take it for the present as correct. In support of it, there is one consideration of considerable weight that might be urged. Mining is so much of an art, that tenants, who take leases of this sort, are generally more capable of judging correctly the quality of coal veins than the landlord of whom they lease. It is no uncommon thing, to find, in the mining districts, men who never read a page of any scientific work, but who, bred up to the business of mining, understand all the peculiarities of coal veins better, and can reason, <em>a priori, </em>on their probable yield more soundly than the most learned professor, who has had no practical experience. Hence it is, that when a miner and an owner of coal lands, who is not a miner, come together to treat for a lease, the advantages which always belong to superior knowledge are on the side of the tenant. If he have doubts of the vein to be worked, he knows how to prove it before his expenditures are made, or stipulated to be made. He is not the party who stands in need of legal implications for his protection; and if he is content to go on without an express covenant of warranty, it will be a grave question, to be decided when it arises, whether he does not go on at his own risk without an implied covenant in his favour. However this may be in general, we must assume that it was so in this instance; and then it is clear, from the construction we have adopted, that the plaintiffs agreed to look for the allowances, mentioned in the 12th article, to the rents to accrue from the R. and S. veins. The mistake which the court made in holding that the covenants sued upon reached beyond the premises leased in the instrument containing the covenants, led them to the illogical result of holding the landlords liable for the tenants’ mistakes, while at the same time they decided that the tenants took the veins “ <em>subject to the ordinary risk of mining, without any covenant express or implied of the existence of coal, or of the quantity, or of the quality of coal.”</em>

These tons were to be added to the production of the other veins, to make up the stipulated aggregate of 50,000 tons from all the veins, but for the purposes of the rent they were to be estimated separately. This must have been so, because the rate of compensation was different from that fixed in the prior leases for the P. and Q. veins. And there was no difficulty in keeping a separate account of the production of the R. and S. veins. It was necessary in settlement with the hands employed, and, in point of fact, it was done, as appears by the exhibit, in the paper-books of the mining operations, from April 1st to July 1st, 1848. To that separate account, and only <a id="p441" href="#p441" data-label="441" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*441</a>to that, we hold the allowances stipulated for in section 12 were chargeable.</p>

Of course compensation was not recoverable in this action for rock, slate, or dirt faults in P., Q., or QQ., and between these veins and the R. vein no intermediate veins were found. Nor were the slope and rock tunnel to be compensated in damages, for these were to be made by the tenants <em>“ at their own expense,” </em>and to be allowed for under the 12th section by deductions from the rent accruing in the R. and S. veins. But for the dirt, slate, and rock faults that should be encountered in driving the gangway of R. and S., compensation was to be made —and that generally — and not out of accruing rents or any other particular fund. An important qualification, however, applicable to all these faults, was that the company were first to be consulted and to approve, “ <em>by their assent in writing, of running sueh gangways in or through any faults.”</em>

The contract, then, is no longer the covenant that was sealed, and the remedy must change with the contract. It is suggested that the action of covenant in Pennsylvania is an equitable action. Before our equity powers were full blown, this action was sometimes made to answer the purposes of a bill in equity, and now, under a 'plea of covenants performed with leave, &amp;c., an equitable defence may be given in evidence; but the action, so far as regards the instrument sued on, is strictly an action at law upon a contract under seal.

In the pleadings their case is that of a covenant modified by parol — in the evidence that of a covenant performed, not according to its tenor, but to the satisfaction of defendants’ agent. The agent denies his assent, and on this point, as is usual with parol evidence, there is conflict. It was to exclude such a conflict that the parties stipulated for the <em>written </em>assent, not of an agent of the company, but of the company themselves. There was no proof that the agent had authority to waive this stipulation. What then did his acquiescence amount to ? At most to an implied <em>assumpsit, </em>on which the company may possibly be liable for a <em>quantum meruit; </em>but it is too ■clear for argument that the acquiescence of the agent could not make them liable in covenant on the sealed instrument.

That the fault was to be tested before the company should be called on to decide whether to stop or proceed, is shown by the provision that <em>ten yards </em>lineal mining' into the fault was to be done by the plaintiffs without compensation, and the excess only to be paid for by the company, and that after being first consulted and approving by their assent in writing.
