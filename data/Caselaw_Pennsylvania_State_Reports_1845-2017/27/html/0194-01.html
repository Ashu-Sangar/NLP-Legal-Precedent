The real estate of James Lytle, the defendant below in that case, was sold, and the proceeds of sale were brought into court for distribution. An auditor was appointed, who allowed to the judgment of Colt’s executors, for use of Marvin <em>v. </em>Lytle, the full amount appearing to be due upon it, upon the ground that the court below had refused to set it aside.</p>

But we are not able to reform the decree so as to enter a final one, because we have not been furnished with the list of liens, and do not know how much remains yet due to the judgment of Hamilton and Wainwright. We must, therefore, reverse the decree and refer the case back to the Common Pleas for correction.</p>
