If the subject-matter could not be divided, it might be assigned to the parties in turns, or the profits divided in a similar way. Upon every such partition there was an implied general warranty. The statutes upon which partition between tenants in common depend, do. but extend the remedy which subsisted at common law between coparceners. The reason why the law annexed the implied warranty in case of partition by writ, was owing to the compulsory nature of the proceedings. It would be highly unjust if the title to one of the purparts totally failed, and the person to whom it had been allotted was evicted, that he should have the whole. Seeing that the law cast that particular part upon him, he should think that <em>ubi eadem ratio ubi eadem lex, </em>when the legislature made partition between joint tenants and tenants in common compellable by writ, the same principle ought to apply.

The order is for the sale of the “ lands and tenements,” whereas the various acts in regard to taking land in execution speak of the “ defendant’s real estate.” The judgment of <em>quod partitio fiat </em>is to be entered by the court upon the appearance of the parties, or on default being made after an examination of the title, and a quantity of the parts or purparts of the respective defendants, as well as of the plaintiffs.

It cannot be expected to do so unless the bidder be allowed a calm and advised examination of the title after the sale. Such examination cannot be satisfactorily made beforehand. If all the bidders must take that trouble and incur that expense, competition will necessarily be reduced, as we find is practically the case with sheriffs’ sales under executions. If a case should now and then occur where tenants in common, unable to exhibit a marketable title, may be prevented from making sale at all, the inconvenience will be partial and temporary, compared with the serious evil which may be expected to result from the contrary doctrine.</p>

It is sufficient for the purposes of the cause to say that such a sale is in pursuance of a judgment' of a court of record — that it can be confirmed or set aside by the judgment of that court alone, and that if the purchaser, to whom the property is sold under such proceedings, have any just reason for setting aside the sale, he must apply to the court having jurisdiction of the case, and by whose order the sale was made, to grant the appropriate relief. This was the course pursued in Richter <em>v. </em>Fitzsimmons, <a href="/watts/4/0251-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="4 Watts 251" data-case-ids="1842706" data-case-paths="/watts/4/0251-01">4 <em>Watts </em>251</a>; and the decree of the court refusing to set aside the sale was held to be conclusive against the purchaser in an action for the purchase-money. It is not material that that case was a sale by the administrator for the payment of debts. The principle on which the decision was made is, that the proceedings of a court of competent jurisdiction cannot be reversed by another court in a collateral action. That principle applies as well to sales in cases of partition as to sales for payment of debts. The same principle was accordingly applied in the case of a sale under the order of the Orphans’ Court in proceedings in partition there: Sackett <em>v. </em>Twining, 6 <em>Harris </em>199. It is impossible to perceive the slightest difference in principle between that case and the one now before us, because the District Court is as much entitled to respect in all cases within its jurisdiction as the Orphans’ Court. In both cases the object was partition, and in both cases the sales were made not by the acts of the parties, but under judicial authority. The court is not authorized to enter into covenants with the pur<a id="p479" href="#p479" data-label="479" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*479</a>cbaser in either case. Nothing can be sold but the title which was vested in the parties to the proceedings. The purchaser bids for that alone. If any unfair representations are made to him at the sale, whereby he is deceived, he may be heard before the court having jurisdiction of the partition, but not elsewhere. It would be productive of great embarrassment in such proceedings if the action of one court could be disturbed or reviewed by a court of co-ordinate jurisdiction in a collateral action. It is the duty of the purchaser to pay his money to the officer of the law, according to the conditions of the sale. The sheriff is not bound, like an individual, to tender a deed before he demands the money. The court will see that justice is done to the purchaser: Scott <em>v. </em>Greenough, 7 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>197; Negley <em>v. </em>Stewart, 10 <em>S. &amp; R. </em>207.
