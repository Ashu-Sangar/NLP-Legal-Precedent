The directors or overseers were always distinct in their authorities and jurisdictions from the county and township organizations. The proprietary charter to the city of Philadelphia conferred no authority to levy taxes for the support of the poor.</p>

The respective Quarter Sessions appointed the officers to have the charge of the poor, and regulated the levy of taxes for their support. The regulations for the poor of Philadelphia were different from other portions of the state. Considerable provision was made by private charity. In 1776 the contributors to this fund were incorporated by the name of <em>“ </em>Contributors to the relief and employment of the poor in the city of Philadelphia:” a loan was authorized, and the taxes levied for the relief of the poor were paid over to them. In 1779 the legislature appointed certain persons by name as managers of this corporation, the occupation of the city by British troops having rendered an election impossible. And in 1782 enacted that in the event of a failure to elect managers, the over<a id="p500" href="#p500" data-label="500" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*500</a>seers of the poor should become a body corporate by the.namepf “the guardians of the poor in the city of Philadelphia.”</p>

This corporation continued until it was merged with other public corporations in the consolidated city in 1854. They were authorized by the Act of 1828 to contract a loan.</p>
    <p id="b500-7" data-blocks='[["BL_500.5",500,[283,840,1162,426]]]'>Their duties were limited to the reception, maintenance, and employment of the poor. They were an eleemosynary corporation to distribute such sums as were paid over to them by the municipal corporations, or derived from their estates, or the labour of the poor under their charge. The money in suit did not come from the municipalities. The loan was by authority of an Act of Assembly. The guardians made the loan, and the faith of their corporation was pledged for its payment. They stipulated to pay the interest, and without a specific enactment for that purpose they were not'justified in paying less.</p>
    <p id="b500-8" data-blocks='[["BL_500.6",500,[282,1264,1161,164]]]'>The authority to tax must be found in an Act of Assembly, and cannot be <em>implied </em>by a strained construction: Permanent Bridge <em>v. </em>Trustees, 13 &amp;. <em>R. </em>422; Blickensderfer <em>v. </em>School Directors, 8 <em>Harris </em>38.</p>
    <p id="b500-10" data-blocks='[["BL_500.7",500,[283,1436,1163,943]]]'>The only source of authority claimed is the Act of 1844. In that it is only “ the treasurers of each county, incorporated city, district, and borough of this Commonwealth,” that are authorized to retain the tax. Unless, therefore, the guardians come within this category, it cannot be claimed that they were under any obligation to retain the tax. That they do not is clear: <em>Angell &amp; Ames </em>10; 1 <em>Bl. Com. </em>43-4. They had no territorial jurisdiction. Their power is similar to the House of Refuge, or hospital, almshouse, or asylum. Because powers are derived from civil authority it does not follow that they are political; these are only such as relate to the government of the people; not such as relate merely to civil rights: <em>Angell &amp; Ames </em>25. The cases cited from 9 <em>Barr, </em>1 and <em>5 Harris, </em>decide only that certain property is subject to taxation in the usual way. That is not the question here. These loans could not be assessed as the property of the corporation. They were debts, not estates. A mortgagor could not deduct the state tax from the interest due, because it had not been assessed as the property of the mortgagee; yet in this case a borrower claims that privilege. The Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Morrison, decided by Judge Pbarson, only decides that the word county was accidentally omitted in the 42d section of the Act 29th April, 1844, but it was contained in the previous part of the section.</p>

The “ Guardians of the Poor” had a loan outstanding of $600,000 and upwards. The treasurer of that corporation retained the taxes at each semiannual payment of interest, from 1845 until 1854. In 1854 the Consolidation Act abolished the corporation called the “ Guardians of the Poor,” vesting its estate in the city, and requiring the city to perform its functions. Under this latter act the state taxes, deducted by the treasurer of the “ Guardians of the Poor” from the interest on the loans of that corporation, were paid over to the city treasurer, who refuses to pay them to the state unless compelled by a judgment of this court. The defence is that the tax upon public loans was not chargeable against a loan created by the “ Guardians of the Poor.”</p>

Shall he be allowed to assert that a tax is chargeable when he demands it from the citizen, and then say it is not chargeable when the state demands it from him ? It seems much more just and reasonable to require that every agent of the Commonwealth who receives money for her in the shape of taxes should pay it over, and let the aggrieved party make his appeal to the state herself. Some of these taxes were received more than eleven years ago. Doubtless the persons who paid them have no expectation that they will be refunded. If the treasurer can keep them from the' state on the ground that the law did not authorize him to receive them, he will not be obliged to’ pay them at all. The city has no right to them; the “ Guardians of the Poor” is a body which does not exist; and the loan-holders, having acquiesced in their payment for eleven years, are presumed to have yielded their right for ever. But they yielded <a id="p502" href="#p502" data-label="502" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*502</a>it to the state for the public benefit, not to the treasurer for his private emolument.</p>

The loan created by the guardians of the poor <em>is </em>a public loan or stock. It is created by a public corporation for a public purpose, and is to be redeemed out of a public fund which is replenished from time to time by a public tax laid on the property of the people. This case therefore comes within the general words of the law of 1844. The omission of any description of such a corporation as this in the details of the law does not authorize us to say that its loans were not intended to be taxed.</p>
