The title to the land in dispute together with 200 acres adjoining it, was in 1830 vested in John Moore. In December of that year, he entered into an article of agreement with Joseph Robinson, the father of the plaintiff, and the father-in-law of the defendant, to sell him the entire tract. At this time Joseph Robinson and his family were residing on a tract of land which Joseph, the younger, had rented from Jesse Beale, and which he was farming for two or three years previously, although he only attained his majority in January, 1831. Joseph Robinson, when he came to live on Beale’s land, was in reduced circumstances, and the property, it was alleged, was all in Joseph’s name, who managed and attended to all the business, the elder Robinson and his daughters assisting in the operations of the farm. On the 22d day of March, 1831, Hugh P. Shelter, attorney in fact of John Moore, came to Juniata county, to execute the agreement made with Joseph Robinson, Sr. The parties went before a justice of the peace, who endorsed on the patent, which had issued to John Moore, the following assignment: — •</p>

Sheller, attorney of John Moore,” ought regularly to have been signed in the name of the principal by his attorney, and the name of the assignee ought to have been stated. It was not good <em>at law, </em>as the execution of a power to sell and convey land. But it contained an acknowledgment of the receipt of the consideration-money from Joseph Robinson, Jr., and that it was paid upon the understanding that the land was to be conveyed. This would be sufficient to induce a chancellor to decree a conveyance, unless some valid objections were shown. It was therefore proper to admit the instrument in evidence, not as a <em>legal conveyance, </em>but as evidence of an <em>equitable </em>title to one. It is a mistake to suppose that the heirs of Joseph Robinson, Sr., necessarily claimed under this assignment. The evidence shows that the elder Robinson had a prior contract in writing with John Moore for the land. The heirs might have' claimed under that contract. Moore, after entering into it, had no right to convey to Joseph Robinson, <em>junior, </em>unless with the consent of the elder Robinson. If that consent was obtained upon an agreement that the land was to be equally divided between the father and the son, and if such division had actually taken place, and each continued in possession of his respective part during the life of the elder Robinson, it is against equity to permit the younger Robinson to defeat it on the ground that it was not authenticated by a memorandum in writing according to the requirements of the statute of frauds. The statute of frauds does not apply to such a case. The elder Robinson had an equitable title, under his written contract with Moore, and was in possession under that contract until he died. His devisees and ffieir vendees have been in possession ever since. Robinson, the <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>younger, claims under an instrument which is so. defective in its nature, that he is obliged to ask the aid of equity principles to enforce his claim. A chancellor would not lend his aid to violate even a mere verbal contract: Patterson <em>v. </em>Martz, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20378" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="8 Watts 378">8 <em>Watts </em>378</a>. He that asks the aid of equity must come with clean hands. If he asks a violation of a moral obligation, his bill will be dismissed : Boyce <em>v. </em>McCulloch, 3 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>429. It may be that a proper application of these principles to the claim of the plaintiff below, may show that his title is as invalid in <em>equity </em>as it is at <em>law. </em>But there was no error in admitting the assignment in evidence.</p>

They could not be made liable for the costs of defending a suit brought afterwards for the land, unless there were covenants in the deed which bound them to defend, or proof given that the defence was conducted at their request. There are no such covenants in the deed; nor is there any evidence that the defence was conducted at their request. It is true that there was some evidence to show that the consideration-money had not been paid, and that Snyder’s right to recover it might depend upon the result of the verdict in this case. This, if true, might render him incompetent as a witness on the ground of interest. But the .subsequent deed of 25th November, 1853, with the acknowledgment of the receipt of the consideration-money, made verbally and at the foot of the deed, removed that interest.
