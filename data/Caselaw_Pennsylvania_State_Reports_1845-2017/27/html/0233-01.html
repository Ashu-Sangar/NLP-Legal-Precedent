In 1841, by codicil to his will, testator gave and bequeathed to his son Dyer all his personal property, to hold for the uses and purposes expressed in his last will, until the youngest son arrives at the age of 21. “ The meaning of the above bequest is that the personal property aforesaid shall be unconditionally the property of the said Dyer Loomis, Jr., at the time Hiram, my youngest son, attains the age of 21 years.” Afterwards, in April, 1841, a contract was entered into between the father and his son Dyer, by which, in consideration of the personal property and use of the father’s real estate, the son was to maintain his father during life, and provide for and educate the minor children until they arrive at the age of 21.</p>

Exceptions to the confirmation of this sale and his account were filed, the whole matter was referred to an auditor, and while thus pending the relator presented her bill .in equity. This set forth, <em>inter alia, </em>that the principal debt, the judgment above-mentioned, had lost its lien by lapse of time, and was originally contracted for use of respondent: that testator, in his lifetime, made advancements to respondent, paid his debts, and supported his family, and that a large amount of personal property of testator was in hands of respondent, and should be divided. Certain interrogatories to respondent were propounded, to be answered by him. He was asked to be required to come to a fair account, pay the debts and legacies out of the personal estate, and be perpetually enjoined against the sale of the real estate. Respondent demurred to and answered the bill. The court overruled the demurrer.</p>
