Peterman, to recover the one undivided half of a tract of land in Lycoming county. On the 4th day of July, 1846, the plaintiff Huling and the defendant Coder entered into articles of copartnership, to be conducted at Hughe'sville, in Lycoming county, and to continue three years. At the time this partnership was formed Huling was embarrassed, and another was entered into dated the 3d of <a id="p85" href="#p85" data-label="85" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*85</a>July, 1846, but proved by the subscribing witness to have been executed the latter end of the month, by which Huling engaged with Coder as a clerk, and leased to him the lot and storehouse, used by the concern, for three years, at $20 per year. ' On the 10th of July, 1848, Coder purchased the land in dispute from George M. Keim, for $3060.70, payable in instalments, viz. $720 on delivery of the deed, $780 on the 1st day of July, 1849,1850, 1851, respectively. The amount of the first payment was borrowed by Coder, and a note given, with a surety for the amount, and which remained unpaid at the time of trial. A saw-mill propelled by water-power was first erected on the premises, and after-wards also a steam saw-mill. In the year 1850 Coder sold an undivided half of the land to Peterman, who was his brother-in-law, and Peterman became from that time connected' with the lumbering operations at these mills. - Pie alleged that he had paid off the three instalments due on the land to Keim, and had taken a transfer to himself of the bonds and mortgage.</p>

He claimed that though the deed was made to Coder, he was the equitable owner of the one undivided half of the premises, and that Coder held the legal title as a trustee for him to that extent.</p>

If Coder and Pluling were partners in the store, Huling would have an interest in the goods furnished to the hands out of the store for work done upon the land, and if he had an interest in the land, and was equally interested in it, he would have an interest in the lumber manufactured from timber growing upon it, and would, in an action between him and Coder, be liable to account for his share of the expenses.</p>

The deed for it is in Coder’s name; but Huling claims the one undivided half on the ground that Coder holds so much of it in trust for him.</p>
    <p id="b88-9" data-blocks='[["BL_88.9",88,[288,741,1163,375]]]'>The facts proved on the trial 'are much complicated; the witnesses were very numerous; the statements shown to have been made at different times by the parties are contradictory; and even the written documents, dated on the same day, are in direct collision with one another. The judge of the Common Pleas, in his charge to the jury, reviewed the facts elaborately, and submitted them fairly. The questions of law raised on the trial were few and simple. No special instructions were asked for by either side.</p>
    <p id="b88-10" data-blocks='[["BL_88.10",88,[284,1126,1165,769]]]'>It is a fixed fact, settled by the jury beyond denial, that when Coder purchased the land, Huling was in partnership with him in the business of selling goods, and had an equal interest in the store and its profits. The verdict makes it equally indubitable that Coder did not purchase on his own account and with his own money, but under an agreement that he was to hold the land for the joint use of himself and his partner, and with funds which belonged to the partnership. We fully concur with the court below in the opinion that these facts gave to Huling an equitable estate in the land to the extent of one-half. We could not deny the correctness of this proposition without saying that one partner may, with the consent of the other, buy real property for the benefit'of both, and afterwards appropriate it entire to his own use because he got the deed in his own name. This would establish a rule under which one partner could always cheat another out of his whole share. It would be a premium on bad faith, and the highest reward that could be offered for the violation of bargains and the disregard of justice, truth, and conscience.</p>
    <p id="b88-11" data-blocks='[["BL_88.11",88,[283,1893,1165,304]]]'>We say therefore, without hesitation, that the instructions which the court gave to the jury on the facts admitted in evidence, were sound, legal, and just. But the facts themselves might have been differently found if the evidence offered by the defendants had been admitted, or if that which they objected to had been excluded. This-makes it necessary to look at the exceptions taken during the trial.</p>
    <p id="b88-12" data-blocks='[["BL_88.12",88,[281,2194,1170,216]]]'>Of course it is not necessary to say that it was right to let the article of partnership be read to the jury; it was direct and positive evidence of the most material fact' in the cause. All the other evidence offered by both sides, tending to confirm and contradict this same fact, was admitted without objection.</p>
    <p id="b89-5" data-blocks='[["BL_89.3",89,[206,401,1166,205]]]'>
      <a id="p89" href="#p89" data-label="89" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*89</a>It made no difference which partner was most in debt to the store. They were equally interested in the funds with which the land was bought, and-the accounts between them must be settled either by themselves or in a proceeding altogether different from this.</p>
    <p id="b89-6" data-blocks='[["BL_89.4",89,[209,616,1166,730]]]'>Where two partners engaged as such in a particular business, specified in their articles, buy land not necessary for their business but with views and purposes beyond and outside of it, such land is held by them as tenants in common: it is not partnership property. The fact that the purchase-money was taken out of the capital or the profits of the partnership business, does not alter the case, nor does it seem to us that the deed being taken in the name of .one partner, changes his equitable relations to the other. When we say, therefore, that we think the judgment confessed by Coder for a partnership debt did not bind Huling’s interest, and that the execution did not sell it, we are not impugning the authority of Hood’s Executors <em>v. </em>Grier (1 <em>Casey </em>480), in the least. Even if this had been partnership property, and if Coder got Peterman to buy it in for him at sheriff’s .sale, the sale would still come to nothing. Coder could not divest Huling’s interest in the land and vest it in himself by a proceeding to which Huling was not a party.</p>
    <p id="b89-7" data-blocks='[["BL_89.5",89,[210,1346,1165,602]]]'>Before the sheriff’s sale of the land, Coder sold one undivided half part of it to Peterman, for a valuable consideration, of which it would seem that Peterman paid at least a part. Coder having the legal title in his hands, Peterman had a right to purchase from him, unless he had notice of Huling’s equity. It must be presumed that he - had no notice, since there is no evidence one way or the other. If he had bought the whole of the land out and out, paying a valuable consideration for it, he would have taken it discharged of the trust. But he bought only the half, and so much Coder could sell without any fraud upon his <em>cestui que trust. </em>Peterman must be presumed to have bought that half which Coder could honestly sell, and not any part of the other half which belonged in equity to another person. For these reasons the agreement between Coder and Peterman was rightly rejected.</p>
    <p id="b89-8" data-blocks='[["BL_89.6",89,[211,1947,1165,301]]]'>It was alleged by the defendants that little or none of the purchase-money was paid out of the store, and that Peterman furnished the funds with which Coder’s obligations were met as they became due. It is assigned for error that evidence of this kind was offered and rejected. But after looking all over'the printed evidence, I find no such offer, no rejection of it, and no bill of exceptions containing anything of the sort.</p>
