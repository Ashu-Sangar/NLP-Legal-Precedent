It is contended on behalf of the defendant, that at the time of the conveyance by Martha Eoutz and Elizabeth Rice to John Steacy, one of the defendants, on the 1st day of April, 1847, Martha Foutz being then discovert, was seised of a legal estate of freehold, and that the same instrument creating this estate, containing a limitation over to her heirs unqualifiedly, she possessed at the time of such conveyance an estate in fee simple; that the entire estate vested in her at the time of her husband’s death; that Daniel Herr took a general trust, not an active one; that the object of the testator creating the trust was to protect the estate from the contracts of her husband, or the payment of his debts, &amp;c.; and that, the estate being given for her sole and separate use, upon the death of her husband it vested in her absolutely. If this was the main intent of the testator, the position taken by the defendants is no doubt correct; but if it manifestly appears from the face of the will, as the plaintiff alleges that it does, that it was the intention of the testator merely to give Martha Eoutz a trust life estate, and that her heirs were to receive a contingent estate in remainder, after her death, then a different result would follow; for an express estate for life is never enlarged to an estate of inheritance, but for the purpose of effectuating the general intent of the testator.</p>

It appears to me, that the testator appears, in the very devise of this property now in dispute, to have studiously endeavoured by the wording of that devise, to guard against any other construction ; for we find that in giving the estate to David Herr, he directs that it shall be during the life of Martha Eoutz; and when in the same clause he says it shall be during the life of Martha Eoutz, and that it shall be for her own support, &amp;c., he also says it shall be for her <a id="p77" href="#p77" data-label="77" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*77</a>natural life; and then again, in ■ conclusion, he says, after her death he gives and devises the said real estate to her heirs in fee simple. It therefore being my opinion that Martha Foust had but a trust life estate in the premises, it .is unnecessary to'enter into an examination of the other questions which were so elaborately discussed in the argument of this case; for according to the rule of law, when the estate limited to the ancestor is merely an equitable or trust estate, and that to his heirs, &amp;c., carries the legal estate, they will not incorporate into an estate of inheritance in the ancestors, as (in general) would have been the case if they had been both of one quality, that is, both legal or both equitable; and therefore direct judgment to be entered for the plaintiff.”</p>

But the plaintiff contends that it is -not within that rule, because the life estate to the daughter is equitable and the remainder to the heirs legal.

It is given to him and his heirs, and comprehends the whole estate. By the terms of the will there was devised to the heirs an equitable remainder after the determination of the' equitable life estate given to their ancestor. The trustee took the legal estate for the use of the testator’s daughter during her life and for the use of her heirs afterwards. But for the heirs it was a mere dry trust, and the remainder was executed in them as a legal estate under the statute of uses. A use executed by the statute is a legal estate to all intents and purposes, as much as if it had been given by the instrument creating the estate without the intervention of a trustee. Where lands are given in special trust for the life of one person, and after his death in general trust for the heirs of the same person, the latter use being within the statute, and the former not, the estates are of different qualities, and the rule in Shelly’s Case <a id="p81" href="#p81" data-label="81" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*81</a>cannot apply. Such precisely was the case of Lady Jones <em>v. </em>Lord Say and Seele (1 <em>Equ. </em>Cases, <em>Abr. </em>383), where the word <em>heirs </em>was held for that reason to be a word of purchase and not of limitation. The remainder in this case was therefore legal, and if the life estate was not also legal, the opinion of the Common Pleas that the first taker had but a life estate was right.</p>
    <p id="b81-6" data-blocks='[["BL_81.4",81,[194,680,1164,646]]]'>Special trusts are not within the statute of uses : and a trust to hold for the separate use of a married woman is special (7 <em>T. R. </em>652). If, therefore, the testator’s daughter had died during her coverture, this case would have been clear enough. But her husband died in 1821. When she became sole, the trust for her separate use ceased; it was no longer a special trust, and the legal estate vested fully in her. It was held by this court in Mark <em>v. </em>Mark (<a href="/watts/9/0410-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="9 Watts 410" data-case-ids="1850011" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0410-01">9 <em>Watts </em>410</a>), that where an estate was devised for the use of children, there being a special trust until the youngest came of age, the children acquired the legal title when that event happened. This is in accordance with the doctrine in England where it is laid down (1 <em>Barn. &amp; Cress. </em>360), as a general rule, that when an estate is devised to trustees for a particular purpose the legal estate vests in them as long as the execution of the trust requires it, and no longer.</p>
    <p id="b81-7" data-blocks='[["BL_81.5",81,[191,1326,1167,428]]]'>Here, then, we have the case of a devise giving an equitable estate for life to one person, and remainder also equitable to her heirs. But the remainder immediately became an executed legal estate in the heirs, while the life,estate was executed not immediately, but some time afterwards. 'Both were legal estates at the time of -the first taker’s death, and at the time of her conveyance in fee to the defendant. Does this state of things leave the case within the exception which says that the two estates cannot unite unless they be of the same quality? It is somewhat curious that no direct authority can be found on this point.</p>
    <p id="b81-8" data-blocks='[["BL_81.6",81,[189,1754,1167,430]]]'>A dictum of Lord Hardwicke, in Spencer <em>v. </em>Bagshaw (2 <em>Atk. </em>270), has been cited to the effect that nothing which happens after the death of the testator can change the estates of the devisees. But that case can hardly be considered as authority, for it has been in effect overruled by several later decisions, and it has not stood the test to which the criticisms of the text writers have subjected it. <em>(Fearne on Cont. Rem. </em>121; <em>Hays on Ent. Tab. </em>2, <em>No. </em>47; 2 <em>Kent’s Com. </em>219.) Besides, Lord Hardwicke was speaking of changes produced by the acts of the parties, which made a question not at all analogous to this.</p>

If it were, and if the will afforded us no .other means of judging, -we might consider the difference in the qualities of the two estates, though existing only for a time, as a strong argument for the plaintiff. But we are considering the application of a rule of law — a rule which often disregards the in-<a id="p82" href="#p82" data-label="82" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*82</a>tention, however clearly expressed. We have no doubt what was meant by this will. Like ninety-nine in a hundred of the cases to which the rule in Shelly’s Case has been held to apply, it was the purpose of the testator to give the first object of his bounty a life estate merely. But the law will not treat that as an estate for life which is essentially an estate of inheritance, nor permit any one to take in the character of heir unless he takes also in the quality of heir. It does not stand with the interest of the state, that lands so devised should be tied up from alienation during the life of the first taker and the minority of his heirs.</p>
    <p id="b82-6" data-blocks='[["BL_82.4",82,[333,845,1166,719]]]'>It is to be observed, that this case is literally within the rule as laid down by the judges in Shelly’s Case. The testator’s daughter <em>took </em>an estate for life under the will, and in the same instrument there is a limitation of the fee to her heirs by way of remainder. The life estate she took was legal after the special trust had ended, and there was then nothing in the quality of the two estates to prevent them from uniting. I have said that a use executed under the' statute is a legal estate. Can it make any difference that it was not executed immediately, if it was executed at all, within the period of its duration ? I cannot see why it should. Chancellor Kent (2 <em>Corn. </em>215) says the-rule applies whether the ancestor takes the freehold by express limitation, by resulting use, or by implication of law. His name will perhaps establish any legal proposition not opposed by the judicial authorities, and if he be right in this, it is manifest that the words of Lord IIakdwicke have been understood by the plaintiff’s counsel in too broad a sense.</p>

The daughter became single, and then she and her daughter and only child joined in selling it. She outlived her daughter, and died leaving grandchildren, and one of them is now claiming that the deed of his mother and grandmother could convey only an estate for the life of his grandmother.
