On 1st April, 1854, Tate and wife conveyed to William Neil for $2500, giving- him a judgment for $850 to indemnify him against the rent reserved by Eberhart out of the land. One-third of the purchase-money was paid by Neil in cash, for the remainder he gave judgments payable in one and two years. Soon after the 1st April, 1854, Eberhart distrained, and sold Neil’s property for the rent then due; a like course was pursued by him after the 1st April, 1855. In 1856 Neil paid the rent to save further sacrifice of his property. The first judgment given by Neil for the purchase money was paid. When the second was due, execution was issued upon it, defendant below obtained a rule on Tate to show cause why the execution should not be stayed until he paid Neil the rent which he had been compelled to pay Eberhart.</p>
