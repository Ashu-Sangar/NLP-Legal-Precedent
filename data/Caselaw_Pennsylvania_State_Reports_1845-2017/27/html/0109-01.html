That there was a small amount of $3.32 allowed the plaintiff and his co-supervisor, Jacob Reiser, at the settlement in 1850, for which an order was given. That no entry was made of the claim of the plaintiff on the hook of the township auditors, and no appeal taken from the accounts settled or the decisions made by the auditors, on rejecting the present claims off plaintiff, which accounts and settlements are made a part of this finding; and that part of the present claim was paid by the plaintiff in February, 1849, and the balance in May, 1849. That the claim of the plaintiff is for' costs paid on a prosecution commenced by him against Robert D. Cummings, at February sessions, 1849, by the plaintiff, one of the supervisors of the township of White Deer, for obstructing a public road in said township, in charge of the. plaintiff; and on a bill of indictment sent up on said prosecution, at said sessions, the same was ignored, and the'plaintiff in this suit found to be the prosecutor, and to pay the costs. If in law the plaintiff can recover on this state of facts, then we find for the plaintiff $176.38 damages and 6 cents costs. If in law' the plaintiff cannot recover, then we find for defendants.”</p>

Where a supervisor has a claim against his township for services rendered, or money expended, it should be presented to the auditors for allowance, and- if refused his only remedy is by appeal to the Court of Common Pleas. A common law action will not be, as there is a specific remedy provided by statute. The money claimed in this suit was paid partly in February and the balance in May, 1849. A settlement of the plaintiff’s account as supervisor was made by the township auditors in March, 1849, and a small balance was paid to him and. his co-supervisor at the settlement in March, 1850. No claim was made at the'settlement in March, 1849, for the money now in controversy; but in March, 1850, when the auditors met to settle the account of the township officers, the plaintiff presented his claim and the auditors declined to allow it, or act upon it, and made no entry of it, but, at the same time, allowed a small claim made by him and his colleague.</p>
