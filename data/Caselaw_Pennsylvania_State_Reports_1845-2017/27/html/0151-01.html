Subsequently, on the 23d January, 1851, they made a further contract, embracing the piece of land which had been surveyed to Enos McMullin ■ <a id="p152" href="#p152" data-label="152" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*152</a>previously when they entered into the article of agreement upon which the present action was based. This was a family arrangement, at which John Glass, the father of Henry Glass, was present;- he- was also the uncle of Enos McMullin, who was the cousin of Henry Glass. By this article of agreement, under the hands and <em>seals </em>of the parties, Henry Glass' acknowledged to have received from Enos McMullin the sum of $350, and in consideration of which payment Henry Glass <em>granted, bargained, and sold </em>unto the said Enos McMullin the land therein described. The land was afterwards surveyed and found to contain about 49 acres, of which McMullin took possession, made some improvements on it, and Henry Glass directing some of his hands to cut timber upon this land, McMullin entered the present action of trespass <em>qu. el. freg., </em>to which the defendant pleaded not guilty and <em>liberum tenementum, </em>and upon these issues the case was tried.</p>

He further testified that he drew the will in accordance with these terms, which was executed by John Glass, and, which remained unrevoked and uneancelled in his possession.</p>

It states that McMullin was to get possession the same day: and, if possession was necessary to support his action, we must presume that he had it, as the verdict is in his favour, and it is not stated in the point reserved that he did not take possession.</p>

But it is alleged that no money was actually paid, or contracted to be paid. It appears that John Glass, the father of the defendant, and uncle to the plaintiff, agreed that if Henry Glass would agree to give McMullin the 50 acres in question, he (John Glass) would give Henry the farm on which' he lived. The agreement between McMullin and Henry Glass was executed <em>on this consideration, </em>and the old man immediately made his will in favour of Henry, according to the contract. He is still living, and has signified no intention to revoke the will, which remains in the possession of the scrivener. The scrivener told the parties that there should be a consideration mentioned in the article, and they agreed upon the amount as expressed. There is nothing to impeach the fairness of this transaction. The vendor gets precisely what he agreed to take — the promise of his father to devise the farm to him. That promise, made on consideration of his conveyance of the land in dispute, is upon a valuable consideration, and an action would lie in favour of Henry against his father’s representatives to recover damages for the breach of it. Henry Glass accepted that promise from his father as an equivalent for the consideration-money expressed in the article of agreement. By acknowledging the payment of the money he-voluntarily placed McMullin in. the condition of a purchaser for value fully paid. Nothing whatever appears to show fraud or mistake, or even reasonable ground to believe that the consideration will fail. On the contrary, if the father should revoke his will "the son may recover damages from his father’s estate. It is not necessary to determine what a chancellor would do in the case. of a mere voluntary agreement finder seal, because this is not such an instrument but an agreement for a valuable consideration. Nor is it necessary to examine into the cases in which parol evidence is admitted or rejected when offered to contradict the consideration expressed in the instrument. The, principle which seems to govern this case, is that where a vendor, without fraud or mistake, accepts <a id="p154" href="#p154" data-label="154" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*154</a>of the engagement of a third person for the consideration agreed on, and on the faith of such engagement acknowledges the receipt, of the consideration, it is against equity that he should be permitted to defeat the operation of the grant by showing that the consideration was not paid. As between the vendor and vendee, the consideration is to be treated as fully paid, and the vendor is estopped from denying it. Standing as a vendee in possession, under a valid contract in writing, with all the purchase-money paid, McMullin was entitled to recover for the trespass, and the court fell into error in refusing to enter judgment according to the verdict.</p>
