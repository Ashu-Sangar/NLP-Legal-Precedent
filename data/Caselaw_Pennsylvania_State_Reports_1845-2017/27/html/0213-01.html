To the assignment there was an agreement annexed, signed by Mrs. Blackford and by Nimick and Co., that so long as no default was made in the payment of the notes of her husband to secure which it had been assigned, she should have the full use and control of the mortgage, receive the interest and change the security, and Nimick &amp; Co. agree to reassign the mortgage as soon as Dr. Blackford shall give an approved endorser on the notes.</p>

The first, which is the more literal construction of the act, seems to have been the one adopted by the court in Cumming’s Appeal, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Jones%20272" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Jones 272">1 <em>Jones </em>272</a>. The objection to this construction is that it sticks too much in the bark, and would defeat the purpose and intention of the act. The other construction, if it be not as literal, is more in accordance with its spirit and design, which was to secure the rights of married women, and is the one adopted by the court in Patterson <em>v. </em>Robinson, and Mahon and Wife <em>v. </em>Gormly and Wife, 12 <em>Harris </em>80. If the literal be the true construction of the act, the testatrix had power to pledge <em>the </em>whole or any portion of her separate personal estate as security for the payment of the debts of her husband; and the assignment of the mortgage, for this purpose, was valid and binding. But the latter, as more in accordance with the spirit, must now' be regarded as the settled construction of the act. And it does not authorize a married woman to enter into any contract of suretyship for her husband, or to pledge, transfer, or assign her <a id="p215" href="#p215" data-label="215" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*215</a>separate personal estate as security for the payment of her husband’s debts; nor does it authorize the mortgage, transfer, or assignment of the wife’s estate by the husband, <em>except in the mode prescribed by the act. </em>The mortgage in this case was not transferred or assigned in accordance with the provisions of the statute which require the wife’s written consent, duly acknowledged before one of the judges of the Common Pleas, to be first obtained; and in no other manner had the testatrix power to pledge or assign it, or to consent to its transfer by her husband, as security for the payment of his debt. The assignment was not such a contract or engagement as the act enables a married woman to make; and, for this reason, it is invalid. If a married woman is not authorized by the statute to endorse a note, or to become security in a bond or other obligation, for her husband’s debt, by what provision of the act, other than that which requires her written consent, duly acknowledged, to be first had, is she enabled to pledge, transfer, or assign any portion of her personal estate, or to consent to its transfer or encumbrance by her husband as security for the payment of his debts ? What is the real and only difference in the nature and essence of these contracts ? By the first, she incurs a personal-responsibility under and in discharge of which a portion or the whole of her estate may be taken. By the second, no personal liability is incurred, but the specific property pledged or assigned may be applied in discharge and satisfaction of the engagement. But if she may pledge a portion, she may pledge the whole of her personal estate, and, in this respect, she has the unqualified power of a <em>feme sole. </em>She <em>may </em>make contracts other than those which are necessary for the management and preservation of her estate. She may enter into engagements, in disregard of the salutary provisions of the act which require her written consent, duly acknowledged, to be first had, by which her whole personal estate may be sacrificed for her husband’s debts; and it will be of but little avail that her power to endorse or to become surety is denied, if she is at liberty to pledge or assign her separate personal estate as security for the payment of her husband’s debts.</p>

      <em>“ </em>It does not help the defendant’s case, in my opinion, that the testatrix is shown to have assigned the mortgage with her husband’s consent. Where one becomes the endorser or surety of another, or when <em>choses </em>in possession or in action are transferred or pledged as security for another’s debt, the law presumes that it is done with the debtor’s consent and at his request. And in every assignment or pledge of the wife’s property for her husband’s debt the irresistible presumption would be, unless rebutted by direct and positive proof, that it was done with the husband’s consent, if not at his request; and so the jury would find. The act was intended for the protection of married women, to prevent <a id="p216" href="#p216" data-label="216" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*216</a>their estates from being squandered by their husbands, or taken in execution for their debts. To hold the wife’s assignment or pledge of her personal property binding and operative when made with the husband’s consent, and of no force or validity when made against his consent, would be an idle and useless distinction. The husband’s consent will always be presumed, and, in point of fact, will always be given. But the husband’s consent to the transfer of his wife’s property as security for the payment of his debts affords no protection to the wife; and, to guard against his importunities, the act requires that the wife’s written consent, duly acknowledged, shall be first obtained.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b216-6" data-blocks='[["BL_216.4",216,[280,853,1170,1285]]]'>“ It is plain to my mind that the act should be construed so as either to give to a <em>feme covert </em>the unqualified power of a <em>feme sole </em>to make contracts of every description, or so as to limit and restrict her power, in this respect, to contracts indispensably necessary to the management and preservation of her separate estate, and to engagements for the sale, mortgage, transfer, or encumbrance of her property where her written consent, duly acknowledged as required by the act, is first had and obtained. Either construction furnishes a rule that is simple and of easy application in practice, but the latter best accords with the spirit and. design of the act. But whatever the construction adopted, it should be 'inflexibly and resolutely maintained. There should be no cases forming an exception to the rule. If there are, it will beget the same confusion and uncertainty, and be followed by the same practical evils that have grown out of the somewhat unsteady and conflicting decisions on the statute of frauds and the statute of limitations. I am, therefore, unwilling to take the initiative in making this case an exception to the power of a married woman to make contracts, as her power is defined in the construction given to the act, in the cases not yet reported, and to which reference has been made. The defendant in this case was notified by the executor not to pay the mortgage, and he paid it in his own wrong. He might have filed a bill of interpleader against the parties, or, after suit brought, he might have paid the money into court, and obtained an order to interplead. If he paid the assignees without requiring an indemnity, it was his own folly. Without notice of any kind, a prudent man, looking merely to the terms and conditions of the assignment, would hardly have paid the assignees and taken their acknowledgment of satisfaction, without making some inquiry of the mortgagee or her representative.</p>
