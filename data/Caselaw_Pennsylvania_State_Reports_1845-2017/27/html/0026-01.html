On the 12th day of April, 1790, John Stoetzel was the owner of a tract of land in Oley township, Berks county, on Furnace Creek, on which was a large spring near his house, and on that day conveyed the lower part, on which there was a paper-mill, to his three sons, John, Adam, and Ludwig, containing thirteen acres and sixty-five perches. This deed contained the following clause:</p>

In 1824 Boyer claimed the right to take the water of the spring and convey it along the creek to his paper-mill. Bieber objected to this, but permitted him to lay pipes from a smaller spring further up through his land, through which the water was conducted to the paper-mill. These pipes were not laid where Boyer claimed the right, nor along the course given in Stoetzel’s deed.</p>

In 1827 the water was stopped, but by whom, or in what manner, does not appear, and it did not pass through the pipes afterwards.</p>

In the spring of 1837, Edelman cleaned the large spring, enlarged its basin, and put a wall around it. At that time he discovered the pipes and cut them off, Boyer being present and making no objection, and admitting that he had no right to take the water through them. «</p>

We are of opinion that the court below was right. The main argument of the plaintiff in error is, that the word convey must be taken in its technical sense. It is true that a term of art in the law when used in a written contract, is always understood by the courts according to the meaning which they have agreed to impress upon it, unless very strong reasons can be adduced to show .that the parties meant something else by it: for instance, <em>heirs </em>and <em>heirs of his body </em>have a certain legal'meaning which will adhere to them until the contrary intent be clearly established; though it is well known that many, perhaps most unprofessional persons, use them as synonymous with <em>children. </em>But it often happens that we have one and the same word for two ideas totally different. Of such a word we can never know the meaning except by reference to the context. There is no better example of this than the word <em>convey, </em>which may mean to <em>conduct </em>water from place to place, or to <em>transfer </em>title from one person to another. Assuming that in the latter sense it is a term of 'art (which it is not), we are still bound to receive it in its other meaning if water was the subject-matter <a id="p30" href="#p30" data-label="30" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*30</a>spoken of; since it would be absurd to speak of conveying water in a technical sense from a spring to a paper-mill. Now it was water that the agreement said should be conveyed “ as it has formerly been conveyed.” The grammatical structure'of the sentence leaves this in no doubt. The right or title is not referred to. The pronoun <em>it </em>can have no antecedent except <em>water.</em>
