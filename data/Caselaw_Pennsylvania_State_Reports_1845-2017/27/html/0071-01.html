The summons was served on the same day, to appear on the 11th of the same month. On the day of appearance the cause was postponed until the 15th of May, 1852. On the 11th Ressler brought suit against Groff in his own name, before the same justice, on a note under seal in favour of Hildebrand &amp; Mayers <a id="p72" href="#p72" data-label="72" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*72</a>for $34.19, and endorsed in blank by the payees to Ressler, and the day of appearance being likewise for the 15th of May. On that day neither of the parties appeared, and judgment was entered in favour of Groff in his suit for $33.65, and in favour of Ressler against Groff for $40.59. On the 20th May, 1852, Groff assigned his' judgment to Peoples &amp; Rohrer, and on the 29th of the same month Ephraim Ressler appealed to the Common Pleas. In October, 1852, the plaintiff entered a-rule of reference, and the arbitrators awarded him $33, and from this award Ressler again appealed. Ressler died shortly after, and his administrator was substituted as defendant. The cause came on for trial in the Common Pleas; the defendant set up the note and judgment obtained on it as a set-off against the plaintiff’s demand.</p>

The appeal was referred to arbitrators, when the same matter was tried again and decided in the same way. Again he appealed, and again failing or being about to fail in his defence on the same matter, he set off bis larger judgment against Groff, obtained before the justice -of the peace, and put Groff into all the costs of a dispute which was réally decided in Groff’s favour.

If Ressler had been bound by law to set off his judgment or lose it, the set-off would, of course, have been right, however it might have affected the costs. But he was not, for it was no longer a disputable claim, and he could set it off against Groff’s judgment after it should be obtained, and ran no risk of being cut out of his rights by a subsequent assignment: 6 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>448; <a href="/watts/8/0443-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="8 Watts 443" data-case-ids="1848441" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0443-01">8 <em>Watts </em>443</a>.

And justice forbade him to do it in such a way as to throw all the costs of his own unjust litigation on the other party, and forbids any rule that would allow him to do it.</p>
    <p id="b74-4" data-blocks='[["BL_74.4",74,[283,511,1163,633]]]'>Ressler’s suit was brought after Groff’s; and if we are to presume that the proceedings before the justice of the peace were entirely regular, then it follows that Ressler instituted a separate suit because his claim was not a proper subject of set-off, say because he had acquired title to it after Groff’s suit was brought. The principal objection to allowing such a set-off, arises from its unjust effect upon the costs: 13 <em>State Rep. </em>554; 1 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>418; <a href="/watts/9/0126-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="9 Watts 126" data-case-ids="1849990" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0126-01">9 <em>Watts </em>126</a>. In relation to the proceedings before the justice of the peace, assume that it was because Ressler could not that he did not set off his demand, and that he may do it now, and we permit a defendant to appeal from a just claim for the mere purpose of setting off an admitted one, which is already established by judgment, and which could be set off on mere motion, and thus throw the costs of a vain proceeding on the party who is not in fault.</p>
    <p id="b74-5" data-blocks='[["BL_74.5",74,[283,1154,1161,214]]]'>The set-off was not tried by the jury, for it was founded upon a record and was tried by the court, and the only issue tried by the jury, and which occasioned all the costs, was the issue on the principal claim, and that was found in favour of Groff, and he ought not to pay the costs of Ressler’s false clamour.</p>

But it stands on the short plea of set-off, and its true character does not appear until the judgment is offered in evidence. Then it appears that the subject-matter of the short plea of set-off is a judgment obtained since this suit commenced. The plea is in the nature of one <em>puis darrein continuance, </em>and since the verdict in the defendant’s favour is founded on it, the plaintiff is entitled to his costs.</p>
