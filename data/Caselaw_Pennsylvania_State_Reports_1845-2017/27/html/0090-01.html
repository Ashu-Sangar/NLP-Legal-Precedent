Shuman, one of the executors of Jacob Shuman, presented his petition to the Orphans’ Court of Columbia county, setting forth that Jacob Shuman had died, having previously made his last will and testament, in which he devised his real estate among several of his children, and fixed a specific value on each tract, and directed that those of his children whose devises exceeded the one-tenth part of his estate, being the number of his children, should pay the overplus to those whose valuation was less; and praying for a citation to issue to show cause why those bound to pay the owelty should not be directed to pay the same. The court awarded the citation. Isaiah Shuman was one of the devisees named in the will, and the devise to him was as follows: — “ I give and bequeath unto my son, Isaiah Shuman, the tract of land where he now lives, except four acres adjoining George Shuman’s lot on the north, leaving 199 acres, more or less, strict measure, estimated and valued at $5970.”</p>

I went to Isaiah’s to survey a lot for George Miller. After I got to Isaiah’s, he went over to the old man to get the papers to make a survey, and I was to draw the title. The old man was very feeble. Isaiah or me asked for the papers, and I think the old man told the old lady to get them. I think Isaiah and the old lady went out and got the papers. I did not see her hand Isaiah the papers. We got them there. The old man and woman both, I think, said the papers should'be returned after we had made the survey and the title was drawn to Miller. We then made the survey. It was told to the old man what we came for; I talked to the old man myself when they were out. Miller was to have about an aere. I made the survey and took the deed along home with me — the deed from the old gentleman to Isaiah (deed given in evidence by plaintiff shown to witness). This is the deed. (An endorsement on the deed, signed by Charles F. Mann, shown witness); I recollect this being on the deed. After I had drawn the deed to Miller, one or two days after, the old man died. I wrote the deed immediately after I got the papers. The old man died one or two days after I wrote the Miller deed. Perhaps I wrote the Miller deed the day after I got the papers. The deed laid with me several days. Isaiah sent word I should not give the deed to anybody. He sent for it, and got it. I think Hiram Ely got it from me. I sent the deed to Isaiah. No money paid when we got the deed from the old man. Old Mrs. Shuman is dead. No one was present but the two old folks, Isaiah, and I.”</p>

I think he gave her the deed and told her to give it to Isaiah. She did so. Isaiah went out. The old woman insisted upon my staying for breakfast, and I stayed. That was the morning after I had been sitting up at night. I never saw him afterwards in his lifetime. I went from home that day or next. I came here to this place at the county settlement. I was county treasurer at the time. I returned the day of the funeral. 1 should think the old man was not' able to sit up.

But a delivery on Sunday had just been pronounced contrary to law and voidable by the parties. It was then no evidence whatever of delivery, and the apparent qualification disappears. It cannot be doubted that the jury understood the court to mean that if they believed the deed was delivered on Sunday, they were not to give it effect. And they did not. Can a deed, duly executed and acknowledged beforehand, be delivered with effect on Sunday ? In England it can, <a id="p94" href="#p94" data-label="94" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*94</a>unquestionably, for the common law never prohibited the making of contracts on Sunday, and their Lord’s Day Act, 29 Car. 2, chap. 7, only forbids work in the course of men’s ordinary calling. It applies to process and proceedings of the courts, and to dealings in the course of trade, but not to the private transactions of individuals as between themselves by way of conveyance: Drury <em>v. </em>Defontaine, 1 <em>Taunton </em>131; <em>Preston on Con. </em>362. But our Sunday Statute of 22d April, 1794, is more comprehensive than that of 29 Car. 2, and interdicts every kind of worldly employment not therein specially excepted, whether it appertain to the ordinary calling or not. It, however, merely denounces a penalty for violation of its provisions, and does not expressly annul or avoid the act done. In this respect it differs from the statutes against gaming, which avoid all contracts made in violation of their provisions, and give a right of action to recover back moneys paid or lost.</p>
    <p id="b94-6" data-blocks='[["BL_94.4",94,[275,1079,1168,1031]]]'>Still the construction which has uniformly been given to our Act of 1794, is that contracts made on Sunday are void ; which is agreeable to the principle laid down by Lord Holt in Bartlett <em>v. </em>Yiner, <em>Carthew </em>252, that every contract made for or about any matter or thing which is prohibited and made unlawful by statute is a void contract, though the statute does not mention that if shall be so, but only inflicts a penalty on the offender; because a penalty implies a prohibition though there are no prohibitory words in the statute. This rule was predicated of an <em>executory </em>contract, and all our adjudications upon contracts affected by the Act of 1794, have had reference to contracts not. fully executed by the parties. Thus in Kepner <em>v. </em>Keefer, <a href="/watts/6/0231-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Watts 231" data-case-ids="1846056" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0231-01">6 <em>Watts </em>231</a>, the action was upon a promissory note, and in Fox <em>v. </em>Mensch, 3 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>444, on a bond given on Sunday, and in Haydock <em>v. </em>Tracy, <em>Id. </em>507, on a promise made on Sunday to pay a debt barred by the statute of limitations. The doctrine of these cases is that the law will not lend its aid to <em>enforce </em>a contract made in violation of the provisions of a statute; but the question now presented is whether the law will undo such a contract when the parties themselves have fully executed it. The plaintiff is not asking that a contract consummated on Sunday should be executed against the other contracting party, but only that he should be left in the enjoyment of the fruits of that execution which, without the aid of law or of courts, the parties made for themselves.</p>
    <p id="b94-7" data-blocks='[["BL_94.5",94,[277,2109,1162,259]],["BL_95.1",95,[227,388,1167,79]]]'>If in Kepner <em>v. </em>Keefer, or in Haydock <em>v. </em>Tracy, the money had been paid in pursuance of the contraband promises, could it have been recovered back? Would not performance of the conditions of the bond in Fox <em>v. </em>Mensch have been good ? If two men agree on Sunday to exchange horses, their contract, so far as respects any legal remedies, is void; but if they <em>make </em>the exchange <a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>in pursuance of their agreement, will the law compel them to trade back ?</p>
    <p id="b95-6" data-blocks='[["BL_95.4",95,[229,475,1182,301]]]'>The answer to these questions is obvious. A contract not void at common law, nor expressly avoided by any statute, and which has been fully executed by the parties, binds them although it was. made on Sunday. An illegal contract executed may be a good consideration for a promise either express or implied, and the court will not unravel the transaction to discover its origin: Fox <em>v. </em>Cash, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Johns.%20212" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Johns. 212">1 <em>J. </em>212</a>.</p>
    <p id="b95-7" data-blocks='[["BL_95.5",95,[229,777,1166,216]]]'>
      <em>In fraudulent </em>contracts the law does not help the parties to the fraud either to performance, or to relief from performance already had, but leaves them as it finds them. These principles are constantly applied, and they are decisive against the present attempt to impeach an executed contract.</p>
    <p id="b95-8" data-blocks='[["BL_95.6",95,[229,992,1167,594]]]'>The delivery of the deed was, it is true, the consummation of the contract, but it was also the execution of it. Nothing more remained to be done, and we do not understand that the deed contained any covenants looking to future performance. The contract was not immoral, nor opposed to any public policy, nor expressly avoided by any statute. . The parties subjected themselves to the statutory penalty for executing it when they did, but they did execute and perform it, and neither of them ever asked the law to undo it for them. We are to take it as they left it. If they were the litigants we would hold them to it, and of course-it is not to be impeached in a collateral proceeding, by others claiming under one of them. Having bound themselves, we leave them bound, and administer their respective rights as we find them defined in their executed contract.</p>
