Grier, to recover damages for personal injuries sustained by him in consequence of being thrown into an open vault, alleged to be on premises owned by defendant. The property was situated in the village of Temperanceville, and contained 120 feet fronting on the south side of the Pittsburgh and Steubenville Turnpike Road. Several houses had been erected on this lot, the front walls coming to the line of the street. In front of them'and extending eight feet into the road, were vaults, communicating with the basement of the buildings. This was covered over with plank, .and contained openings to admit fuel, <em>&amp;o. </em>In 1849 the title to this property was vested in a man of the name of Smith, and was levied and sold as his property by the sheriff to the defendant, Grier. After the sheriff’s sale the defendant alleged that Smith and his tenants remained under a parol agreement, and that a reconveyance was to be made of the property as soon as Smith would refund to Grier the amount of the purchase-money and the amount of Grier’s debt against Smith. Under this arrangement Smith remained until 1853, when the tenements upon the lot were consumed by fire. An insurance was in existence, the amount of which the defendant Grier received, which reimbursed him for the money paid on the purchase and his debts. The fire had consumed the plank which covered the vault in the street or road, and it remained open.</p>

If this be so, there can be no recovery against the defendant, in this action: but is the law as contended for by defendants counsel ? There is no evidence that the vault, when covered with plank as it was when defendant purchased the property, was dangerous to persons passing along the road. There is no evidence that it became dangerous until after the destruction of the buildings by fire.

Every owner of property is bound to take proper care of it, and to see that its condition is not such as to become a nuisance, and if he fails in duty in this respect, he is liable for the consequences.

    <p id="b190-6" data-blocks='[["BL_190.4",190,[288,1062,1165,1104]]]'>A conveyance of land bounded by a road or street, gives the grantee a title to the middle of the road or street, if the grantor owned thereto: Paul <em>v. </em>Carver, 12 <em>Harris </em>207; and in the absence of title papers we are to presume that a lot bounded by a street extended to the middle of it. If this street in Temperanceville was laid wholly on the adjoining owner; if the lot in question was indeed bounded by the margin, and not the middle of the street, the defendant should have shown it. Without any evidence to that effect, we hold that the title he acquired by the sheriff’s sale extended to the middle of the street, and comprehended, of course, the <em>locus in quo. </em>But he offered to show, as set forth in the sixth bill of exception, that after the sheriff’s sale he agreed by parol with Smith that he would reconvey the premises on being paid the amount that Smith owed him, and what he had expended in the purchase of the property; and that in pursuance of this agreement Smith remained in possession, repairing, using, and occupying the premises, and paying the rents to the defendant on account of the stipulated purchase-money until the buildings were destroyed by fire, when the defendant received the residue of the purchase-money out of the insurance upon the buildings and Smith’s goods and fixtures. The court ruled that the defendant might show Smith in possession at the time plaintiff was injured; but that if the premises were vacant at that time, the possession followed the legal title, and was in the defendant; and that the parol agreement without such possession in Smith was no evidence of title. Was it?</p>
    <p id="b190-7" data-blocks='[["BL_190.5",190,[287,2175,1163,217]],["BL_191.1",191,[202,384,1169,1251]]]'>A purchaser of land at sheriff’s sale acquires not the possession of the debtor as whose property it is sold, but only the right of possession; and the Acts of Assembly furnish him with a summary process for obtaining the actual possession. If, instead of resorting to his legal remedy, he makes such an agreement as was offered <a id="p191" href="#p191" data-label="191" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*191</a>to be shown here, it might be a serious question whether there was any such taking possession in <em>pursuance </em>of the parol agreement as would amount to part performance; but if it be granted, that there was, it is indispensable to the vitality of such an agreement that the possession be <em>maintained. </em>That Smith did not maintain his possession, that he was not in the actual possession when the plaintiff was injured, we are obliged to conclude from the defendant’s failure to prove it when he had leave to do so. It was argued that Smith must be considered as still in possession, because Grier had executed no writ of possession against him; but this argument kills off the parol title, for to make out <em>that, </em>we must consider Smith as surrendering the possession to Grier, and resuming it under the parol agreement. If so, he was bound to maintain it; and when he abandoned it, it -reverted to Grier. A man sells land by parol and puts the purchaser in possession, who, instead of remaining, quits the possession and leaves the land vacant; can there be any doubt that the possession follows the legal title ? It must vest somewhere. The rights and responsibilities that pertain to the possession of land must for ever attach to somebody, and in judgment of law they attach to the owner of the title when no one has the actual <em>possessio pedis. </em>Would a chancellor decree a conveyance to a purchaser by parol who had abandoned the premises and surrendered the possession to the owner of the legal title ? Clearly not, even though he had paid the purchase-money in full; for this could be returned, and interest on it would be compensation. The recent decisions in this court on the statute of frauds and perjuries, are decisive of this question. Then there was no title in Smith by virtue of the parol agreement, and the court were right in their ruling.</p>

Certainly the parties might hold themselves bound by it, but if they meant to, why did they not execute it ? Why did not Grier convey the legal title, and why did not Smith retain the possession ? If it be said that he did, the question then is, why did he not show it ? These are questions that even a stranger to the title has a right to ask when he is looking for the party who is responsible to him for a serious personal injury. Suppose he had sued Smith instead of Grier, the sheriff’s sale would have been pointed to as divesting Smith’s title; and the possession surrendered, as it might well be without process, would have cleared Smith of all responsibility. The plaintiff would then have alleged the parol agreement, but the answer would have been that that was never executed, nor in so far performed that a chancellor would feel compelled to decree specific execution. Thus Smith would escape liability by repudiating the very title which Grier asserts as his means of escape, and the wrong done to the plaintiff would go unredressed. The <a id="p192" href="#p192" data-label="192" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*192</a>law, faithful to the public safety, furnishes a plain and simple rule for determining the liability in such cases. It holds the party in possession responsible; and if there be nobody in possession, it refers the injured party to the owner of the legal title. The record shows that Grier was the owner in this case; and what the defendant offered to prove, taken in connexion with that which he was permitted to prove, but did not, was insufficient to divest his title.</p>

The defendant was denying his ownership of the property, and the fact of his demanding and receiving the insurance money therefor, was evidence against him, whether as between him and the insurance company he was or was not, in strict right, entitled to receive it.</p>
