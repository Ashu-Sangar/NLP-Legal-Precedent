    "head_matter": "Druckenmiller versus Young, Agent of Bright.\nIn an action of covenant brought by E. B., allowing the plaintiff to file a new near., setting forth an agreement under seal in the name of J. Y., agent of E. B., was a proper amendment.\nThe allowance of such an amendment was not the introduction of a new cause of action.\nUnder the Act of 1852, the court have power to correct a mistake in the names of parties, whether it arises from a mistake of law or fact.\nThe declarations of a party made after the execution of a written agreement, are not part of the contract, and are not admissible for the purpose of varying- or changing its legal effect.\nError to the Common Pleas of Northumberland county.\n\u25a0 This was an action of covenant commenced before a justice of the peace, in the name of Elizabeth Bright against Daniel Druckenmiller, and removed into the Court of Common Pleas by appeal. The cause was arbitrated, and an award in favour of the plaintiff, from which the defendant appealed. On the trial in the Common Pleas the following facts appeared.\nOn the 10th day of February, 1858, John Young, agent of Elizabeth Bright, leased to the defendant a house and lot in Sun-bury for one year from the 1st April, 1853, at a rent of $55. The defendant took possession on the 30th March, 1853. After the award of arbitrators, the plaintiff, with the leave of the court, filed an amended declaration, setting forth the covenant as made with John Young-, agent of Elizabeth Bright, and to the filing of which exception was taken by the defendant as introducing a new cause of action subsequent to the award.\nOn the trial, the defendant alleged that the premises were so much out of repair as to be untenantable, and offered to prove by the depositions of Lydia and M.ary Druckenmiller that Elizabeth Bright, the plaintiff, promised after he had taken possession of the house, to have the necessary repairs made at her own expense. The court rejected the depositions.\nThe jury found for the plaintiff $62.25.\nThe errors assigned were to the court permitting the plaintiff to file an amended natr., and to add the name of John Young, agent, and to the rejection of the depositions of Lydia and Mary Druckenmiller.\nRockefeller and Cornyn, for plaintiff in error.\nLawson and Brown, for defendant in error."
