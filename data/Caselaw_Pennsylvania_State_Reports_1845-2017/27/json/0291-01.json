    "head_matter": "Coleman versus Lewis.\nA purchaser of land at sheriff\u2019s sale with notice that another had the right to remove a house erected on the land, cannot claim damages for such removal.\nError to the Common Pleas of Indiana county.\nRobert Fleming was the owner of a lot in the borough of Indiana, and in 1843 agreed with his sister Sarah to build her a frame house on the lot: she to pay for the cost of its erection, to live in it as long as she pleased, and if she saw fit, or if her brother sold the lot, or it was sold from him, she was to have the right to remove the house. The house was built, and paid for by her, and she lived in it until March, 1852. In 1850, James Todd obtained a judgment against Robert Fleming; aj\u00fc. fa. was issued, and levy made upon the lot, without mentioning the house occupied by Sarah. The property was sold by the sheriff to William Lewis, plaintiff below, and the deed acknowledged to him, 15th Dec., 1851. At the time of the sale, Lewis knew, and was informed, that the house was the property of Sarah Fleming. William Coleman et al., the defendants below, at the request of Sarah Fleming, and for her benefit, in March, 1852, before Lewis obtained possession of the premises, removed the house, and this action on the ease was brought against them by Lewis.\nThe court (Burrell, P. J.) charged the jury that the frame house was a fixture, and admitting the contract between Robert and Sarah Fleming, and Lewis\u2019s knowledge of it, the judgment of Todd was a lien on all fixtures, and Lewis, as sheriff\u2019s vendee, could hold all the judgment was a lien on.\nThe jury found for the plaintiff $56 damages.\nThis charge was the error assigned.\nBanks, for plaintiff in error,\ncited Rogers v. Gibson et al., 4 Y. 111; Heister v. Fortner, 2 Bin. 40; Church v. Griffith, 9 Barr 117; White\u2019s Appeal, 10 Barr 252; Mitchell v. Freedly,\nId. 198; Harlan v. Harlan, 8 Harris 306; Wells v. Bannister, 4 Mass. 514; Taylor v. Townsend, 8 Mass. 411; Doty v. Graham, 5 Pick. 487.\nDrum, for defendant in error.\nBuildings erected on the premises, or substantial additions to a house, are not removable: Gibbons on Fixtures 35; 13 Law Lib.; 1 Kent Com. 343; 1 Taunt. 21.
