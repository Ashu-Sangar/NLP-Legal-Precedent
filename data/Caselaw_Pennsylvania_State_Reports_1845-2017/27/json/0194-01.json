But we are not able to reform the decree so as to enter a final one, because we have not been furnished with the list of liens, and do not know how much remains yet due to the judgment of Hamilton and Wainwright. We must, therefore, reverse the decree and refer the case back to the Common Pleas for correction.\nDecree reversed accordingly, at the cost of Elihu Marvin.",

Colt\u2019s Executors. The real estate of James Lytle, the defendant below in that case, was sold, and the proceeds of sale were brought into court for distribution. An auditor was appointed, who allowed to the judgment of Colt\u2019s executors, for use of Marvin v. Lytle, the full amount appearing to be due upon it, upon the ground that the court below had refused to set it aside.\nThe case was submitted without argument by\nMarshall and dfrant, for appellant.\nNovember 7, 1856,\nBabbitt and Spencer, for appellee."
