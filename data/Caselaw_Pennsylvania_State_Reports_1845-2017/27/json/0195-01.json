Judgment was entered February 23, 1856, for a want of an affidavit of defence. Execution was issued the same day and put into the sheriff\u2019s hands on the 25th. March 26, 1856, defendant entered bail for the stay of execution, which was approved by the President Judge. April 22, 1856, defendant moved the court to set aside the execution on the ground that bail had been entered for the stay. The court (Galbraith, P. J.) granted a rule to show cause, and made it absolute March 23, 1856.\nThe setting aside the execution was assigned as error.\nGrant, for plaintiff in error.\nThe defendant claims a special statutory privilege, hence, the provisions of the statute must be strictly complied with: Zack v. Pennsylvania Railroad Company, 1 Casey 396; Smith v. Moffat, 1 Barb. 65; Young v. McKenzie, 3 Kelley 31; Schuyler & Co. v. Mercer County, 4 Gilm. 20. The Act of 16th June, 1836, Pamph.

Johnson, 2 Miles 346; Picard v. Prescott, 1 Pa. Law Jour. 1; Roup v. Waldhauer, 12 Ser. & R. 24.\nLane, for defendant in error."
