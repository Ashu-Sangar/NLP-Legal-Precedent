    <p id="b230-5" data-blocks='[["BL_230.6",230,[296,489,1162,429]]]'>The present case was ruled by the court below, upon the principle set forth in Hill <em>v. </em>Witmer, decided by the District Court, and reported in 2 Philadelphia Reports 72, the syllabus of which is, “A material-man took the note of a contractor for the materials furnished a building, and extended the time of payment. The owner, having no notice of the claim before the note fell due, paid the contractor in full. Held, that the owner, or rather the building itself, stands in the light of surety for the contractor, and that the <em>agreement to give time </em>discharged the building from the lien.</p>

    <p id="b230-7" data-blocks='[["BL_230.8",230,[293,1087,1164,853]]]'>It is submitted, however, that the building for which work has been done, or materials furnished under the mechanic’s lien, does not stand in the position of a surety: so that, even giving time to the contractor, does not discharge the building. The lien is absolute for six months after the work done or materials furnished ; it is collateral security during that time, and the security is only lost upon failure to file the lien. The owner can protect himself by refusing payment to the contractor until a release is furnished. In this case the notes were so drawn as to fall due within the period of six months from the date of the last materials furnished. The last item was furnished on the 14th of January 1857, whilst the last note became due July 7th 1857, within the six months. The owner is supposed to know the progress of the building, and is not obliged to make any payment until he has ascertained that the mechanics and material-men have been paid. But a release of the principal does not necessarily release the surety. Besides, no stipulation was made here for giving time to the contractor, which distinguishes it from the case of Hill <em>v. </em>Witmer. The same doctrine is held in Weakley <em>v. </em>Bell, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Watts%20283" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="9 Watts 283">9 Watts 283</a>.</p>

      <em>Benjamin Johnson </em>and <em>William A. </em>Porter, for the defendants. ■ — The point upon which this case was determined has never been directly passed upon by the court of last resort, but was determined by the court below in 1856, in the case of Hill <em>v. </em>Witmer, which is reported in 2 Philadelphia Reports, p. 72.</p>
    <p id="b231-6" data-blocks='[["BL_231.6",231,[185,623,1160,303]]]'>The points decided appear to be, first, that where the owner and contractor are different parties, the building or the owner stands toward the material-man in the light of a surety for the contractor; and second, in the absence of any reservation, that where time is given by the creditor to the principal (the contract- or) by a binding agreement, without the consent of the surety (the owner), that the latter is discharged.</p>
    <p id="b231-7" data-blocks='[["BL_231.7",231,[180,923,1165,721]]]'>These principles are, as was held by the court below, <em>“ </em>Obviously both just and reasonable, and seem required by analogy.” The materials for which the claim was filed, <em>were </em>ordered by the contractor alone — he is the sole party charged in the plaintiffs’ books. The plaintiffs were unknown to the owners, who were a corporation, nor was there any obligation given, or agreement entered into, which made them liable for the debt. The contractor entered into the contract on September 9th 1856, the last materials were furnished 1-lth January 1857. It is not pretended that the owners ever heard of the plaintiffs, but it is in evidence that negotiations and settlements on account were entered into between rhe plaintiffs and the contractor, while the materials were being furnished. With such facts as these established, it is submitted that the contractor must be regarded as the original debtor, or principal in the transaction. A debt due to him by the claimant may be the subject of a set-off: Gabell <em>v. </em>Parry, 1 Harris 181.</p>
    <p id="b231-8" data-blocks='[["BL_231.8",231,[182,1653,1163,560]]]'>There is nothing in the Mechanics’ Lien Act which tends <em>to </em>alter the terms of such a contract, or diminish or increase the liability of the contractor. The object was not to create a personal liability in third parties to the contract, or to give a right of action to the material-man, which he himself never anticipated or provided for. The lien given by the act is simply a collateral security for the payment of the debt. The material-man obtains a hold upon the building, or the materials themselves, if he desires it, but there is no provision in the act which obliges him to resort to that fund or to the proceeding <em>in rem, </em>or prevents the parties settling the debt by any payment, or accord and satisfaction which may be most agreeable.

The plaintiffs, however, deprive the surety of this remedy, by entering into <em>a binding agreement </em>with the contractor on <em>4th March </em>1857, <em>to give him time, </em>by accepting these promissory notes, the first of which would not fall due for sixty days, to wit, <em>6th May </em>1857. During this time all right of action was suspended, and both the contractor and the plaintiffs could claim the benefit of it. The owner could not pay the debt after the contractor had obtained the extension, and demand reimbursement, for the debt was not then payable. Even after the first note became due, the contractor was under no obligation to pay without a surrendering up of the remaining notes, which probably had been negotiated. They bound themselves, at least, to give time to their principal, without notice to their sureties, and that was sufficient grounds for the entry of judgment by the court below on the point- reserved.</p>
    <p id="b232-3" data-blocks='[["BL_232.5",232,[286,1129,1162,1108]]]'>Armed with such a receipt as was obtained from the plaintiffs, the contractor had an absolute right to demand immediate payment.

The object was merely to “ ascertain the amount of claims against the building.” They had not any delegated power from the church to acknowledge debts, or enter into any contracts, nor had their meeting the slightest reference to the proceedings between the contractor and the plaintiffs in March 1857, five months previous. It is not easy to perceive how this meeting could vary or affect the terms of the written agreement entered into at another time by different parties. That plaintiffs’ lien was brought to their notice was immaterial. They had no powers to bind the corporation, and neither assented nor excepted to it. The declarations of these individuals as to how they proposed to settle with the contractor, showed no assent by the corporation to the extension of time granted.</p>

This was after the extension, and the payment referred to was a payment of the notes given by the contractor. It is sufficient to observe that no time was agreed on — that these trustees were acting singly, had no authority to bind the corporation — that the contractor was not present, and that they in no way made reference to the extension that had been given. Such evidence was not sufficient to affect the written agreement.</p>

But it was thought, in the court below, that the receipt given for the notes amounted to an agreement to give time, and that therefore the church building, standing in the position of a surety for the contractor, was discharged from the lien. The receipt, however, contains no express engagement not to sue Nicholson upon the original account until the notes taken as a cumulative security should fall due. Was such a binding agreement implied in the transaction ? Does the receipt from a debtor of a promissory note, payable at a subsequent day, not in satisfaction of the debt, but to be satisfaction when paid, raise an implication that the creditor engages not to sue for the original debt until the note matures? Upon this question the authorities differ. In Okie <em>v. </em>Spencer, <a href="/whart/2/0253-01" class="citation" data-index="19" data-cite="2 Whart. 253" data-case-ids="1830449" data-case-paths="/whart/2/0253-01">2 Whart. 253</a>, where the holder of a promissory note on the day that it became due, accepted from the maker a cheek drawn upon a bank by a firm, consisting of the maker and a third person, dated six days after-wards, which check was to be in full satisfaction of the note in case it was paid at maturity, it was held that this amounted to a suspension of the remedy against the maker, and discharged the endorser. The check was not the check of the debtor alone: and Judge Kennedy, in delivering the opinion, relied upon that as a distinguishing fact. He remarked, that “ had the drawer given his own check merely for the payment of the note at the expiration of six days, there might have been some colour for saying that he (the creditor) had not thereby precluded himself from bringing suit on it during that period; because it might then have been argued with great plausibility, if not correctly, <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>that he had obtained by it no additional security, and consequently no adequate consideration to make a promise of indulgence binding; that by the check he acquired nothing except the personal responsibility of the drawer, which he had before by virtue of the note ; and therefore had he even made an express promise of indulgence for the six days, it might have been alleged that he would not have been bound by it for rvant of a sufficient consideration.” The case of Mercer <em>v. </em>Lancaster, 5 Barr 160, was one in which the surety of the debtor took a note of a third person, endorsed by the debtor as counter security. There was no taking by the creditor of a new security. Mr. Justice Rogers, <em>arguendo, </em>remarked, that by taking the new note endorsed by his principal, the surety had debarred himself from calling upon the creditor to collect the money due upon the note of the principal and surety. It was not a question between the creditor and the debtor, and the new note was an additional security, for it gave to the surety another promissor whom he had not before. The <em>dictum </em>of the learned judge, therefore, was not applicable to a case where a fresh security of the debtor alone payable at a future day, is taken as a collateral. But in Myers <em>v. </em>Wells, <a href="/citations/?q=5%20Hill%20463" class="citation" data-index="20" data-cite="5 Hill 463">5 Hill 463</a>, the case was this: A note had been endorsed for the accommodation of the maker, who transferred it to a merchant as collateral security for the payment of the price of goods thereafter to be furnished. Goods were accordingly furnished, and on a settlement of accounts some months after the note fell due, the maker was found indebted in a large amount, for which the merchant took his notes, payable at a future day. It was held by the Supreme Court of New York, that this suspended the merchant’s right to sue the maker of the first note until the last-mentioned notes fell due. The court attributed some importance to the fact that an account had been stated which was in itself a sufficient consideration for an agreement to suspend suit against the maker. But the ruling was distinct that the taking of the new notes implied an agreement to give time on the old. Several authorities were cited in support of the decision, and among them Okie <em>v. </em>Spencer, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Whart.%20259" class="citation" data-index="21" data-cite="2 Whart. 259">2 Whart. 259</a>. I do not find, however, that the authorities cited sustain the ruling in the broad terms in which it was made. The case of Kendrick <em>v. </em>Lomax, 2 Cromp. &amp; Jer. 405, is most in point. There it was held that a creditor who had taken a new negotiable security, not in satisfaction of, but as collateral to a former bill, could not sue on the first bill without producing and giving up the new bill. So far, however, as I have been able to examine the modern English cases, they seem to recognise the doctrine that the taking a negotiable security for and on account of a debt, operates <em>primé facie </em>to suspend the creditor’s right to sue for the debt until the new security becomes due. Such was <a id="p236" href="#p236" data-label="236" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*236</a>asserted to be tbe law in Walton <em>v. </em>Mascall, 13 M. &amp; W. 452, by Baron Parke; and such also was the ruling in Baker <em>v. </em>Walker, 14 M. &amp; W. 465, and Price <em>v. </em>Price, 16 M. &amp; W. 232. Tbe doctrine of Fellows <em>v. </em>Prentiss, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Denio%20518" class="citation" data-index="22" data-cite="3 Denio 518">3 Denio 518</a>, is the same.

In Weakly <em>v. </em>Bell &amp; Sterling, <a href="/watts/9/0273-01" class="citation" data-index="24" data-cite="9 Watts 273" data-case-ids="1850049" data-case-paths="/watts/9/0273-01">9 Watts 273</a>, Judge Kennedy, who also delivered the opinion in Okie <em>v. </em>Spencer, goes over the cases, and comes to tbe conclusion that “ taking a new note for tbe same debt mentioned in the old, without any agreement to give time to the drawer, or to deliver up the old note to him, or that the new shall be taken in satisfaction of the old note, has ever been considered a mere collateral security which does not affect or alter the original liabilities of the parties on the old note, in any respect whatever.” And in Bank of Pennsylvania <em>v. </em>Potius, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Watts%20150" class="citation" data-index="25" data-cite="10 Watts 150">10 Watts 150</a>, tbe doctrine asserted in Weakly <em>v. </em>Bell &amp; Sterling, was reaffirmed.

If this is so, it is unnecessary to inquire whether the church building is to be regarded as standing in the relation of a surety for the contractor, for it was not established that any time was given.
