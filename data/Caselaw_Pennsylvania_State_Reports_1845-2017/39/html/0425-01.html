By his first wife, James had five children. After her death, he married his present wife, by whom he has one child.</p>

Depositions were then taken, which established the facts of the intemperate habits of the respondent, and his harsh and cruel treatment of his wife, &amp;c. The court, on hearing, directed the executors to apply the sum of $320 annually to the maintenance and support of James Noble, and that portion of his family who live with him; and $160 to the support and maintenance of his wife and her daughter, until otherwise ordered.</p>

The interest is to be applied to the necessities of Noble, and those of his wife and family- during his life; and his wife complains that he has become so intemperate and improvident, that he is entirely unfit to receive it for the benefit of his family, and prays for a decree that it may be so applied. The degree of intemperance established by the evidence is so gross, as to lea-ve no doubt about the justice of the decree made by the court below.</p>

Her desertion of him appears not as a ground <a id="p427" href="#p427" data-label="427" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*427</a>for the decree, but as an effect of his intemperance. This income is for him and his family, and he is totally unfit to use it for their benefit. This justifies the decree, so far as it allots part of the money to be expended by the wife. We find no fault in the opinion of the court below.</p>
