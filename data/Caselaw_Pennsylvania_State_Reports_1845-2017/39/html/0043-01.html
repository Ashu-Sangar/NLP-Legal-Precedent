If extinguishable, the capital which would produce an interest equal to the rent, would be the sum necessary to be paid to extinguish the charge. This is the usual course of such transactions, and we have not a word to show that any different mode for ascertaining the rent was to be observed. If the words do not forbid it, then the construction will be that the usual mode was intended.</p>
    <p id="b49-7" data-blocks='[["BL_49.8",49,[154,1306,1159,813]]]'>The deed of the grantees provides, “ that the land and plantation, with all the improvements thereon, are to be valued,” not at what they would rent for by the year. The words used have a greater scope than this, and there is nothing elsewhere discoverable which would qualify them. The suggestion that six per cent, is too high a rate for a farm, may be true or not, owing to many circumstances — it might be a high rent now, and a very low one fifty or a hundred years hence. This consideration is too vague to be allowed to alter the obvious import of the words used. Having valued the land and plantation, then the future rent is to be ascertained by <em>so much </em>as the <em>true value </em>of said land and improvements “shall exceed the rent reserved,” by adding one “ full half or moiety of each excess” to the existing rent. The valuation is to get at a capital, the interest of which is to be the rent reserved. It is not pretended that the half value of the premises is to be paid as rent every year. This would be absurd. But the fee was to be valued, to get at the sum that half of the interest would represent, which being added to the existing rent, was to be the future charge.</p>

There are certainly no words limiting the valuation to what the premises would rent for per year, which would involve calculations for taxes and repairs, as contended for by the defendants.

On the other hand, in <a id="p50" href="#p50" data-label="50" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*50</a>addition to the difficulty in estimating what the taxes might be and the repairs in the future, the process might result in great injustice, as has been well suggested by the plaintiff’s counsel, by letting the farm and improvements so run clown at the period for estimating the annual value as to be of little worth. Thus, although the fee might have greatly appreciated in the general property of the county, or advance of property in the neighbourhood, the rental might be very little, if any, advanced. Tested by the words used, and supported by the object of the parties, and the mode in which such matters are usually transacted, we think the decree at Nisi Prius was based on the true construction to be given to the deed.</p>
