That the plaintiffs are leather-dealers in New York, and there was a course of dealing between the parties in which the plaintiffs bought hides for defendant on commission, and sent them to defendant, who tanned them and sent the leather to plaintiffs to be sold on commission. The indebtedness of defendant to plaintiffs is made up of charges for purchases of leather, loans of money, payments for freight, <em>he. </em>The amount due to plaintiffs is $19,598.47. This course of dealing is by no means a fact to be disregarded in considering this affidavit, as it shows that the plaintiffs had just reason to expect consignments of leather to reimburse them for their advances and disbursements. In December 1857, the defendant sold his tannery to Messrs. Barnet &amp; Shnyder. The learned counsel for defendant say that the defendant informed the plaintiffs of this fact. The defendant Avas at the house of the affiant, Thomas Smull, in Brooklyn, on the 1st of April 1858, and there told him he had invested a large sum of money in bond and mortgage, but these are not the terms to convey the idea that a man has conveyed <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>his property. There is nothing in the affidavit which asserts that he had communicated the fact of this sale to Barnet &amp; Shnyder; on the contrary, the language he used rather imported that he had surplus means for which he sought an investment. Some time after this, he ceased to ship plaintiffs any leather, and, on being written to 'to account for the delay, he requested an interview with affiant at Bethlehem. The interview was had on the 19th of June 1858; and not until he is closely pressed, does he confess that he has sold the leather to Messrs. Barnet &amp; Shnyder. This purchase by Barnet &amp; Shnyder, the affidavit alleges, was made at the special request of defendant, and that it was for some four or five cents less per pound than the leather cost the defendant. The affidavit further alleges repeated offers of defendant to pay the plaintiffs $7000, if they would give him a receipt in full. This the plaintiffs declined to do unless the defendant would give them a full and fair statement as to what became of his property; but this the defendant refused to do. The defendant’s counsel say this offer of $7000 was an offer of compromise of a disputed claim, but I cannot understand the affidavit to read thus, but, on the contrary, it asserts a just indebtedness of $19,548.47, and repeated offers of $7000 to be taken in full of it, accompanied with persistent refusals to disclose what had become of his property, and declaration of the defendant not to pay them a cent because his offers had not been accepted.</p>

Fraud is to be inferred from a number of facts and circumstances, and it is sufficient if the inference of fraud at the close of the affidavit is justified by the preceding allegations therein. I think they are sufficient to justify the allegation that the defendant has property which he has disposed of to defraud his creditors, and that he has property which he fraudulently conceals, and that he is about to remove property without the jurisdiction of this court, with intent to defraud the said plaintiffs.

Considering then the affidavit to be sufficient, is the answer filed by defendant, but not verified by oath, to be con<a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>sidered as a controverting of the facts and circumstances alleged in plaintiffs’ affidavit, within the meaning of the Act of Assembly ? This proceeding has been justly said by Chief Justice Savage, in Spencer <em>v. </em>Hilton, <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wend.%20611" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Wend. 611">10 Wendell 611</a>, not to be in perfect analogy to any proceedings known to our laws. It is not exactly like a proceeding to hold to bail, as it existed before this act, for the affidavit on which the warrant issued may be controverted ; nor is it like a bill in chancery, for the defendant is not obliged, though he may answer it under oath. When a defendant was arrested before the act, or where he is arrested now in a case to which the Act of 1842 does not apply, the affidavit to hold to bail is conclusive, and cannot be controverted. The Act of 1842 allows an arrest of the defendant in an action on a contract only on a warrant issued by a judge, and founded on an affidavit establishing to his satisfaction certain species of fraud. This the defendant may controvert, but how ? By his simple negation of the plaintiff’s affidavit ? I think not. The plaintiff has, by his oath, sworn to facts which place defendant without the pale of the statute, and there he must stay, if he makes no answer to it. This, I think, is the construction put on a similar act in New York in <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Wend.%20611" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="10 Wend. 611">10 Wendell 611</a>, and in our own state in Gosline <em>v. </em>Place, 8 Casey 520. It is not like the case of a warrant on a criminal proceeding, or a case of summary conviction, say the judges in the case above cited. The right to controvert the allegations of the plaintiff’s affidavit is for the protection of the defendant; he is not bound to become his own accuser if he is conscious of the truth of the charge against him; but if his conscience acquits him, he has a right to become a witness in his own cause, and to establish his innocence by his own oath; for this purpose he is entitled to have copies of the affidavit served on him, so that he may come prepared to meet the charge against him, by his oath, or by other proof, if he chooses. I am informed by the president judge of the court, that the practice in the District Court when he was on that bench, was to commit, if the affidavit was sufficient, and was not met either by the defendant’s denial under oath, or by countervailing proof. I am therefore of opinion that the answer, not being verified by oath, is to be treated as no answer.</p>

The 1st section abolished imprisonment in any suit or proceeding, instituted for the recovery of any money due upon any judgment or decree, founded upon contract, or due upon any contract express or implied, or for the recovery of any damages for the non-performance of any contract, except in certain specified cases. The 2d section then takes up the class of cases, in which, by the previous section, imprisonment is abolished, and authorizes a creditor who shall have commenced a suit, or obtained a judgment, to apply to any judge of the proper court for a warrant to arrest the defendant, when the judge is to require “satisfactory evidence, either by the affidavit of the party making such application, or some other person or persons,” that there is a debt due; that it is of a nature for which the defendant could not be arrested, and that the defendant is about to remove his property out of the jurisdiction of the court, with a view to defraud his creditors, or that he has done or is about to do any of the other several things that are enumerated in the <a id="p315" href="#p315" data-label="315" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*315</a>3d section. The affidavit is required to “establish to the satisfaction of the judge” one or more of these particulars. That done, he issues a warrant, which is to be accompanied with a certified copy of the affidavit, both of which are to be served on the defendant. Then, by the 6th section, the person so arrested may, on his appearance before the judge, “ controvert any of the facts and circumstances on which such warrant issued, and may at his option verify his allegations by his affidavit; and in case of his so verifying the same, the complainant may examine him on oath, touching any fact or circumstance material to the inquiry, and the answers on such examination shall be reduced to writing, and subscribed by him.” The judge is required, by the subsequent sections, to receive any other evidence that may be offered on either side; and if, on the whole, he is “satisfied that the allegations of the complainant are substantiated, he is to commit the defendant, unless he pays the debt, or gives security to pay it, or gives a bond to the complainant, with surety that he will not remove or assign his property, or that he will within thirty days apply for the benefit of the insolvent laws of this Commonwealth.”</p>

It is not, as is argued, a penal law; but, as was expounded in G-osline’s Case, 8 Casey 526, simply an arrest for debt, under the regulated supervision of a judge. Before the Act of 1842, a plaintiff might, on affidavit of cause of action, take his <em>capias ad respondendum </em>at pleasure, and hold his debtor to bail, or throw him into jail. The act abolished that power of creditors. But the abolition was meant to enure to the benefit of honest debtors only. If the creditor could satisfy the judge of any of the statutory specifications, and thus establish a <em>primá facie </em>case of fraud, either actual or contemplated, the act did not even then abandon the debtor to the mercy of the creditor, but subjected him to the scrutiny of the judge, after full notice of what was alleged’ against him, and with full opportunity to repel and explain every allegation of the creditor to the satisfaction of the judge. How can this be thought a harsh or unreasonable law? Why should it be subjected to the severe and unfriendly criticism which it received in the argument ? Regarded as a substitute for the old <em>capias ad </em>respondendum, it is most indulgent to honest debtors.</p>

If the act compelled the judge to receive the complainants’ affidavit as true, and shut the defendant’s mouth from contesting it, then it would be just as oppressive as the common law was before the act was passed, and no more. <a id="p316" href="#p316" data-label="316" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*316</a>But the act does not give any conclusive effect to the affidavit. It makes it only evidence, like an oath in chancery, and it legalizes, with equal effect, the counter oath of the defendant. It contemplates a controversy before the judge. The allegations and affidavits of the parties, and any other proofs within their reach, make up the controversy. The substantiation or the overthrow of the allegations in the complainant’s affidavit is the issue in this forensic battle, and not until the judge is satisfied that they are substantiated is the defendant pronounced liable to arrest. As was said in Spencer <em>v. </em>Hilton, 10 Wend., of a similar statute in New York, the analogy is not perfect to any proceeding known to our laws, and we must construe the statute by itself. But it is very plain what it means — it was competent for the legislature to pass such a statute, and it was executed with remarkable accuracy, not only by Judge Stein in this case, but by Judge Merrifield in G-osline’s case, the only cases that have been up. Defendants, to whom such full opportunity to explain themselves is secured, have no reason to complain of the operation of the statute. It is impossible for creditors to fabricate false charges so ingeniously that an honest man cannot expose them by his own oath, or otherwise, and it is not to be presumed that a judge would refuse to accept as satisfactory an explanation that was full and sincere.</p>

The affidavit itself contains a sterner statement of facts, and broadly charges that the said Samuel J. Berger has a large amount of property, which he fraudulently conceals and unjustly refuses to apply to the payment of his indebtedness to plaintiffs; that he has removed, and disposed of large amounts of property, for the purpose of defrauding his creditors; and that under the exemption laws of Minnesota, in which state he has established himself in business, real and personal estate to a large amount may be withheld from the reach of creditors.</p>

He contented himself with a demurrer, and an <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>unsworn answer. Denying many of the allegations of the affidavit, and disclaiming all fraudulent purposes, he admitted himself to have received $24,000 for his tannery and personal property, part of which he had applied to debts, part had loaned out on good security, and part he had invested in Minnesota, where he admits he had removed, and intended to make further investments.</p>
    <p id="b317-6" data-blocks='[["BL_317.6",317,[151,706,1166,303]]]'>The result of the controversy so conducted was to satisfy the judge of the substantial truth of the allegations on the part of the plaintiffs. We are not to review his opinions of the proofs, but to see that his proceedings were regular. We find them regular in all respects. He had before him all that the statute required him to have, to give him the jurisdiction he exercised, and his judgment must be executed.</p>
