The case before us is stronger than either of these, for the conviction is neither reversed nor set aside; its consequences only were evaded by the arrest of judgment.

This was not enough, even if it were possible, under any circumstances, to recover against such a record as existed in the case. There should have been testimony to show the case of the prosecution, and that there was no reason or probable ground for it. This was not done. It was a material allegation by the plaintiffs that there was no probable cause for the prosecution, and that there was malice. We should have heard, in substance at least, what the case made was, so that we could determine how these facts were preliminary to considering the question of damages. There may be many cases in which the party charged is entirely innocent, and yet the prosecutor not liable to respond in damages on account of it. It must appear, somehow, that the prosecution was groundless, and so known, or ought to have been known to be, by the prosecutor. We commonly judge of this from the facts and circumstances of the prosecution itself, or the declarations of the prosecutor. Want of probable cause, and malice, were affirmative facts, which the plaintiffs were bound to prove; and this was not accomplished by the small amount of evidence going to establish the probable innocence of the plaintiff’s wife.
