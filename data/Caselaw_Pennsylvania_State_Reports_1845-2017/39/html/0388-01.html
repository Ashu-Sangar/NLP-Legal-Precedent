The note as filled up and made to read for $150 is without erasure, and presents no appearance of a single letter or word put in the place of another. The fraud has been committed by means of air addition made to the note. It appears from the case stated, that when Gheen endorsed the note, a partial blank was left, sufficient to allow the drawer, Layman, to increase the sum without suspicion, and in such a manner that no person using ordinary diligence would have discovered that it had been made improperly.</p>
    <p id="b390-6" data-blocks='[["BL_390.6",390,[291,795,1164,902]]]'>It is evident that Layman, when he filled the note up for fifty dollars, designed at the time the perpetration of the fraud. He placed the figures 50 a sufficient distance from the $ to allow another figure to be inserted between it and the dollar mark. In the body of the note (which is a printed blank note) on the line where the sum was written, the word “ fifty” was commenced in the middle of the line, <em>and with a small letter, </em>so that ample space was left in that line for the insertion of other words before the word “fifty.” The note thus prepared and written, Gheen endorsed on the back, and also placed his name on its face under the words “ Credit the drawer,” and handed it back to Layman. Layman then inserted the figure 1 between the figures 50 and the dollar mark ($), and wrote before the word “fifty,” the words “ One hundred &amp;,” and passed it off as a genuine bill for $150. This alteration or addition to the note is not obvious or apparent. When the attention is called to it, it appears by inspection in some difference in the colour of the ink, but of so slight a character as not to arrest the attention or arouse suspicion. The note for the smaller sum thus imperfectly filled up and written by Layman, the drawer, was endorsed by Gheen and left by him in the hands of the drawer.</p>

We think he was. To use the language of C. J. Best, in a similar ease, in delivering his opinion in the case of Young <em>v. </em>Grote, 4 Bing. 253, “ A man of business would have guarded against fraud in the mode of filling it up; he would have placed the word fifty at the beginning of the line, and would have commenced it with a capital letter so that it could not have had the appearance of following properly after a.preceding word; he would also have placed the figure 5 so near the printed $ as to prevent the possibility of interpolation.”</p>

But if it were established that the defendant, in endorsing the note as he did, did an unusual thing, and was guilty of great carelessness, is it true that the plaintiff suffered from <em>it? </em>Was it the <em>defendant’s </em>act which injured him ? Not at all. It was the act — the fraud and forgery — of <em>Layman </em>which imposed upon and injured the plaintiff. If I purposely (though innocently), or carelessly, induce another to believe a fact is in a particular way, and that other act upon 'it, I shall not thereafter, as against that man, assert the fact to be otherwise. Both being innocent <em>I </em>shall suffer any loss which may follow, because <em>I </em>induced him to act. But if a man take advantage of my act (of carelessness, if you choose), <em>and commit a crime, </em>which I may thus have rendered easier than it otherwise would have been, am I to be held responsible for the loss which may flow from it ?</p>

This case was decided in 1793; and it is submitted, with proper deference, that the decision upon the facts as reported is unreasonable, and not such as would be made at this day anywhere. It was a suit against the endorser of a holograph bill, which was originally drawn for eight pounds sterling. The word “eight” came <em>near the end </em>of a line, so near that to insert <em>“y four” </em>required it to be <em>crowded. </em>After the bill was endorsed, it was altered by adding “y” to the “ eight,” and the word “four” after it, making it read “eighty-four.” This “y four” presented a <em>“crowded appearance” </em>at the end of the line. And yet the Scotch court held, that leaving at the <em>end of a line a space of about half an inch </em>(insufficient to write “y four” without crowding), was such <em>carelessness </em>as should subject the endorser to the liability of bearing the loss arising from the alteration. There are not probably three cases out of five, where good business men write notes, in which <em>as much, and often more, </em>space does not exist at the end of some of the lines. According to this authority, all these men are guilty of carelessness, and would be liable for any increase of their obligations made by <em>crowding in </em>a word of three or four letters at the end of a line.</p>

The opinion of the court is embraced in less than four lines. Now, in this case, there certainly would seem as much, and more reason, for holding the acceptors <em>liable for the bill as altered, </em>than in Pagan <em>v. </em>Wylie. Yet the court decided that the acceptors were <em>not so liable, </em>but that the bill was good for the <em>fifty-eight </em>pounds, the amount for which it called before being altered.

And yet we would not be understood as denying the case of Young <em>v. </em>Grote, in the same book, p. 187; 4 Bing. 253. It may be that a check on a banker, so written as to be easily altered by the bearer of it, ought to be treated in the same manner as instructions sent by a principal to his agent, wherein the latter is not allowed to suffer from the carelessness of the former. Thus, probably, alterations in checks may be properly distinguished from those in bills, notes, and other contract. We doubt it, however.</p>

If the sum had been left entirely blank, the inference would have been that the parties authorized the holder to act as their agent in filling .it in, and they would have been bound accordingly. But where a sum is actually written, we can make no such inference from the fact that there is room to write more. This fact shows carelessness; but it was not the carelessness of the endorser, but the forgery of the maker that was the proximate cause that misled the holder. And we know not how we can say that a man can be chargeable with a contract because he did not use proper precaution in guarding against forgery in any of the thousand forms it may take. We know of no way of saving purchasers of negotiable paper from the necessity and the consequences of relying on the character of the man they buy it from, if they do not take the trouble of inquiring of the original parties.</p>
