That it was hers before marriage cannot be pretended here; there is no sufficient evidence that it was given to her subsequently, and if I understand the Supreme Court of this state aright, a married woman cannot acquire property subsequently to marriage by her toil, because the proceeds of her labour belong, in point of law, not to her, but to her husband.</p>

The proof of a loan of money by a brother-in-law, and goods by a sister, was too indefinite for any practical use. It was not shown what amount of money was loaned, whether one dollar or one hundred, nor what amount of goods were advanced. Upon such evidence a jury could not piossibly determine any extent of interest in Mrs. Wallace through and by means of money thus borrowed, without any account of the amount, and so with the goods advanced.</p>

There is no room for an implication that the earnings of the wife, the result of her skill, credit, or industry, are to have a different direction and a different ownership since the act, from what they had before. To hold this doctrine would be to constitute every married woman a <em>feme sole </em>trader whenever she can get credit, so far as the creditors of her husband were concerned, and yet to leave him answerable for her contracts in purchasing the very goods upon which she trades, 'if purchased with his knowledge, and without his dissent. She has no power to contract for the purposes of trade. When she does so, the law esteems her the agent of her husband, and looks <a id="p133" href="#p133" data-label="133" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*133</a>to him as the responsible party: Heugh <em>v. </em>Jones <em>et ux., </em>8 Casey 433; 1 Blac. 443, n. 31; Hallowell <em>v. </em>Horter, 11 Casey 375. When the husband knows of and assents to his wife’s purchases, no matter what she does with them afterwards, he is answerable on her contract for them. How, then, can it be said that such goods are obtained by or result from the wife’s property, and to be protected by the act ? Her credit is nothing in the eyes of the law, outside of the special cases in which it is allowed to be pledged; it is esteemed his credit, and the necessary corollary from this legal position is, that the fruits of it are his.</p>

If purchased and afterwards paid for by the wife with money belonging to her before, or accruing to her during marriage, a very different question would arise. Here it was not pretended that the moneys paid on purchases were other than such as had been received on prior sales of goods purchased on credit.</p>
