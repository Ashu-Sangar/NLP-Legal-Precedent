He then conveyed the whole ownership to Graham &amp; McBirney for a full price, which was actually paid and receipted in the deed, which is put upon the record as notice to the subsequent lien-holders against F. A. Ward. C. L. Ward himself puts this state of facts before the public, and then at the.sheriff’s sale gives notice that F. A. Ward has no interest in the lands to be sold, still further embarrassing the whole matter, and serving to reduce the very fund which he now claims against subsequent creditors. If the lands did not bring enough at the sheriff’s sale to pay all the liens upon them, it was because of the embarrassments thrown in the way by C. L. .Ward. Equity will insist upon his now remaining out of the way. His lien sunk in the fee when both were united in him.

This might be conceded, without in the least affecting the rights of C. L. Ward.

The purchase-money due upon the contract, independent of the judgment, is still unpaid; and, if his rights under his judgment be taken away, he not only loses the purchase-money, and the amount due on his judgment, but he is obliged to pay the money in court to the younger judgment-creditors.</p>

The argument of the auditor, in reference to the value of the lien of the judgments being diminished by the sale of C. L. Ward, and the similar argument of the counsel, is wholly refuted by the statement of the position of the parties, to wit:—</p>

The judgments are a lien upon all the lands are worth beyond that sum, and thus the value of the liens is ascertained. The conveyance to Graham &amp; McBirney did not add to the purchase-money, which alone could affect the <em>value </em>of the lien.</p>

Ward <em>intended </em>that his deed to Graham &amp; McBirney should be or become a complete conveyance of the land, and of course he intended the consequence that his own liens upon any part of the title should be thereby discharged. It was not the intention, but the fact of complete conveyance that was to have that effect. The fact failed, and therefore the effect does not arise. The conveyance did not pass the whole title, because of the outstanding equitable title of F. A. Ward, which had become subject to liens, the first of which was in favour of C. L. Ward. This interest continued, and of course the liens on it continued; and instead of it, Graham &amp; McBirney held C. L. Ward’s covenant of warranty. It was not title, but covenant for title, which they had actually got, and the continuance of C. L. Ward’s lien was not inconsistent with that, but might be in aid of it. His lien was not upon the legal title which he had held, and had conveyed to Graham &amp; McBirney, but on the equitable title, which he was bound to remove. The enforcement of his lien against this can have no effect upon the title of Graham &amp; McBirney, and they cannot be parties to the proceeding; for it is only against the equitable title, which, so far as lien-creditors are concerned, belongs to F. A. Ward, and not to them.</p>

C. L. Ward was to have, and had a lien on the goods purchased, in order to obtain payment out of them, but he did not obtain it. He had means designed to secure payment, but never payment itself. The goods were not his; no part of them had been sold to him in discharge of his claim; but he had a lien on them all to secure it. But they did not secure it.</p>

Ward, because he held the legal title. The goods obtained by that sale were not C. L. Ward’s goods, but E. A. Ward’s, to be sold at his profit or loss, and the proceeds to be his ; though, by virtue of a lien in favour of C. L. Ward, through the possession of a third person, those proceeds were to be applied first to certain debts of E. A. Ward, including those owed to C. L. Ward. No one says that C. L. Ward took the goods as payment, or that he got his pay out of them, or that he agreed to discharge his liens, and we do not regard either of these as the necessary legal effect of his acts.</p>

He was striving to get all the liens paid, but did nothing to weaken those that are here complaining. He could not do it. He failed in his efforts, without either injuring or benefiting them, and they have no equity to put him in a worse position for his own claims, because of his want of success. And as the goods were delivered in consideration of an engagement for a full title, discharged of liens, they can have no claim that the transaction shall be regarded as an equitable or constructive discharge of C. L. Ward’s lien, while they continue to insist on their own. They must show that the lien was in fact and in law discharged. They have not done this.</p>
