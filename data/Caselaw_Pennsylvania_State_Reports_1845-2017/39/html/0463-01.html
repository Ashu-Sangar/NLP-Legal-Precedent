Soon after his death, Abraham Fleming, to whom letters of administration had been granted, applied in the usual way for an order of court to sell this real estate for the payment of the debts of the deceased. The order was granted, and the land sold on the 15th of August 1859, to Michael Lambert, which sale was in due time confirmed by the court. Before the deed was delivered, Mrs. Kline presented her petition to the Orphans’ Court, setting forth that her father died about five years ago, from whose estate she had received $960, which she gave to her husband to invest for her in real estate in her name, which he agreed to do. That about three years ago, a contract was made with Lewis Kintzfor the purchase of the land in question, to be paid for with her money, the deed to be made to her.

That, at the request of Kintz, a deed was prepared for Mrs. Kline, which was executed. That, on the day when the deed was executed, Beelman appeared, and, on examining it, refused to lend money to Kline on mortgage, unless the deed for the land was in his name, or unless Mrs. Kline would join with her husband in executing the bond and mortgage to him. Kline remarked that his wife would sign no judgment or mortgage, and requested the scrivener to erase her name from the deed, or write a new one. A new deed was then written for Kline alone, which was executed by Kintz and wife. Kline then gave his judgment to Kintz for the balance of the purchase-money, as also a bond and mortgage to Beelman for $400. It was further proven that when the deed was to be written in her name, in pursuance of the agreement, she said that as the property had been sold to her husband, Kintz should make the deed to him, and take the judgment from him, as she would give no judgment on her property. That Kline had said that he only bought the property because his wife wanted to put the money into it which she had received from her father’s estate, and that he had paid $900 of her money on account of it, and therefore he was willing that the deed should be m.ade in her name.</p>

If she has failed in proving a resulting trust, she has no case; and such a trust is not to be made out by equivocal and unsatisfactory evidence. Had the deed for the land been made to Kline and his wife, in accordance with the. article of agreement, her rights would be easy of ascertainment. But it was not. By her positive direction the deed was made to her husband. If she took any interest under the article of agreement, it was but a naked possibility, and that she surrendered before the deed was made, declaring that the sale had been made to her husband, and that the deed should be made to him. It is true, that equitable interests in land are within the Statute of Frauds, and are not assignable except by writing; but they may be waived by parol, so as to put it out of the power of the holder to obtain the interposition of a chancellor in his behalf, or they may be released: Boyce <em>v. </em>McCullough, <a href="/watts-serg/3/0429-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 429" data-case-ids="1854634" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/3/0429-01">3 W. &amp; S. 429</a>; Dayton <em>v. </em>Newman, 7 Harris 194. In any view which can be taken of this case, however, the title of the appellant is not based upon the article of agreement. If she has any interest, it arose out of the payment of her money at the time when the deed was made to her husband. But the husband having paid the purchase-money, the presumption would be that he paid it for himself, and this presumption the appellant must overcome. True, the husband had in his hands $960 belonging to his wife, a part of which, probably most of which, was paid on account of the purchase-money; but there is no other evidence than the subsequent declarations of the husband, that it was paid as the money of the wife, and in order to secure to her any ownership of the land. These declarations were made after the rights of creditors had accrued, after a mortgage had been given to Beelman for money loaned, and after the husband had confessed a judgment for the unpaid purchase-money. It may well admit of doubt whether, in a contest between the wife and the husband’s creditors, his declarations are evidence in her favour. Nor is it to be overlooked that the statements of Kline, upon which the appellant relies to establish her title to the land, are not strictly consistent with the facts of the case. To his brother he said that he had paid $900 of his wife’s, money on the land. This was certainly a mistake; for, even if no part of the purchase-money <a id="p469" href="#p469" data-label="469" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*469</a>was paid out of the sum which he borrowed from Beelman when the deed was made, the entire amount paid appears to have been $815. For the remainder of the purchase-money, a judgment was taken. Yet upon such loose and mistaken declarations, the appellant is forced to rely for the establishment of a trust for her benefit. We have often said that the evidence must be clear and convincing that shall warrant setting up a resulting trust against the legal title.. Whether the evidence in the present case be of that character, may be doubted. Without the casual declarations of the alleged trustee, uttered some time after the purchase, not made in the presence of the <em>cestui que trust, </em>declarations proved by his brother alone, and shown to be inaccurate, there is no evidence that the wife was anything more than the creditor of the husband. It is worthy of observation, also, that many of the material allegations in her petition are completely disproved. Prominent among these is her averment of ignorance of the fact that the deed for the land had been made to her husband, until after his death, and her denial that she had ever given any consent to such transfer.</p>
    <p id="b469-6" data-blocks='[["BL_469.6",469,[187,1238,1162,343]]]'>But, without positively deciding that there was no resulting trust in favour of the appellant, it is sufficient to justify the action of the Orphans’ Court, that only the estate of John Kline, the husband, was sold. That court had no power to- order a sale of any more than his interest in the land: Diehl’s Appeal, 9 Casey 406. Moreover, the purchaser asks to have the sale confirmed, and the mortgagee and judgment-creditor have rights superior even to the equity of the appellant, if she has any.</p>
