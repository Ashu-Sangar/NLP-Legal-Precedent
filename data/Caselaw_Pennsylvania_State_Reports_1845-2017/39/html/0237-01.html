In his will as at first written, following immediately the direction to pay to his wife and son the interest of the residue during their natural lives, he says, If one of the above-named deceases, the other surviving, are to draw their whole of the interest,’ thus enlarging the estate of the survivor in the residue from a life interest in one-half to one of absolute ownership in the whole. The will, as drawn at first, was altered so as to take from the survivor one-half of what was primarily bequeathed to her or him, and give it to Joseph Logan, intending the other half to remain in absolute ownership to such survivor.”</p>

Instead of going to the survivor of the residuary legatees, it was to go to Logan. But it was the “part” of the decedent legatee that was to so go. The word is part, and it cannot mean the whole.
