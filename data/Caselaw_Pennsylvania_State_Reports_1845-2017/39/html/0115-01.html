In either case the will is a private law of descent and distribution, and, if revoked at all by operation of the general law, it is because of some defect in itself, and not because of the authority or power on which it is grounded, but entirely irrespective of this. The will is set aside wholly or partially because the law presumes that it does not express the final intention of the testator, and this reason of the law takes no notice of whether the power to make the will comes from public law or from private contract.</p>

Now, it matters not whether it be said that this principle was derived from the Roman law, or from our human instincts of justice, certainly it is now a legitimate element of our common law, and we would not have received it but for those instincts. The Romans received it before us, bécause they were before us, and because they, too, were human.</p>
    <p id="b119-7" data-blocks='[["BL_119.7",119,[157,959,1161,599]]]'>This principle gives the fundamental reason of all the positive rules of law we have on this subject. There are subordinate reasons everywhere varying the rules according to the laws of descent. The positive rules are given sometimes by statute, and sometimes by judicial decision; but they are all attempts, more or less adequate, to give expression to this principle of the common law, in its application to different classes of cases. And the most positive of these rules are sometimes changed merely incidentally, by a change in the law of descents. For the law does not do or require vain things. It does not revoke when the person supposed to have been unintentionally left unprovided for could have gained nothing by the revocation, or could do just as well without it. It would not revoke in favour of a widow who has quite as good a remedy by election.</p>
    <p id="b119-8" data-blocks='[["BL_119.8",119,[159,1558,1159,685]]]'>In England, the laws of descent of real estate are so different from those of the distribution of personal estate, that this principle had to be expressed in different positive rules in relation to each. But with us it is not so; and our Act of 4th February 1748-9, and still in force by re-enactment, fits our system of intestates’ estates, both real and personal. The purpose of the principle, it is fully quoted by Rogers, J., in <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Whart.%20219" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Whart. 219">1 Whart. 219</a>, is to correct the evil of an unintentional omission in a will, and the rule embodied in our statute is an improvement on the earlier judicial expressions of it; for it avoids the will only so far as affects the share which the neglected person would have taken without the will. Even the recent statute of 1 Vict. c. 26, s. 18, which applies to wills of man and woman, and to those under a power of appointment, as well as under general law, is not so considerate; for it makes the revocation entire. Of course no one could claim a revocation who would take nothing by descent.</p>
