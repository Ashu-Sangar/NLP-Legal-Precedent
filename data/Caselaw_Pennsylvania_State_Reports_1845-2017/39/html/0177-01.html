It was the duty of the defendant not only to allow him to pass, but to have <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>facilitated his movements in that way. It was clearly his duty to have yielded part of the road if he could. If not, he should have stopped his team and have allowed the plaintiff to pass. He was not asked to do either. The plaintiff was willing to make his way round the wagon or team. If you believe the evidence, the defendant was not willing that he should do so, but, sitting on his wagon with a load upon it, and four mules attached to it, allowed his son to start the team at a rapid rate to prevent his passage. Failing in that, the whip was applied, and the team pursued the light carriage, doubtless with a view of punishing plaintiff for having accomplished a passage round them. If such was the case the act was wrong, and the party deserves to be punished. You may find from the evidence that the cause of the subsequent disaster dated back to the time when the vehicle passed, before the descent of the hill was approached. If you believe the evidence of William Bartholomew, the mule team was driving at so rapid a rate that it could not be taken up at the brow of the hill. The attempt was made to stop and brake the wagon; in the effort the mules became entangled in the harness, and ran off down the hill; the plaintiff got out of the road as far as he .could, but not far enough to escape the damage; a collision took place; his buggy was overturned and broken in pieces; the defendant’s team and wagon did the act; was it done in such a manner and under circumstances that render him liable for the damages sustained?</p>

The evidence does not show either negligence or wilful wrong on the part of the plaintiff; he was, comparatively, a stranger in the country; the defendant was well acquainted with the road; he knew that a long and rapid descent was before them, and it is for the jury to say whether he approached it .with a loaded wagon in an ordinarily careful or skilful manner. It is not enough to answer that he did not intend to injure the property of the plaintiff; he was bound to exercise ordinary skill and care to avoid such a result; he should have exercised his rights upon that highway with a due regard <a id="p180" href="#p180" data-label="180" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*180</a>to the rights of others; if his mules ran away — if you believe the evidence — it was the application of the whip that first started them; if prudent management would have prevented the collision, then the defendant is clearly liable.</p>

But it was for the jury to say whether, under the evidence, the plaintiff was entitled to recover, and whether the evidence sustained his action; and this was fairly and broadly submitted. “ If the damage was the result of negligence on part of the plaintiff, he cannot recover; or if it was caused by the mutual fault of both parties, he cannot recover.” This was giving the whole case to the jury. It referred the question of fault and negligence to them under the evidence.</p>

If this were true it would be error, as there was some diversity of testimony as to whether the disaster was the result of accident purely, or of carelessness or recklessness. This presented a question for the jury.</p>
    <p id="b184-9" data-blocks='[["BL_184.13",184,[285,1165,1163,290]]]'>Considering the whole charge and answer to the points, we think that portion of it constituting the first assignment of erro.1, is not obnoxious to the objection interposed. The learned judge said: “ The action is trespass, and the suit is well brought in that form. The act was done by the defendant himself, and not by his servant; he was himself sitting upon the wagon, and could have directed the movement of his team.”</p>
    <p id="b184-10" data-blocks='[["BL_184.14",184,[284,1465,1162,938]],["BL_185.1",185,[161,402,1167,345]]]'>The defendant rested much on the position that- as his servant was driving, the action should have been case, not trespass. This very properly engaged, in the outset of the charge, the attention of the court, and the learned judge being fairly interpreted, in substance, only said that the action was well brought in trespass, for the defendant was present, and as the injury resulted from his own team, driven in his presence by his own servant, which he could have controlled, but did not; and therefore, as the judge afterwards put it to the jury, if “ the damage was caused by the carelessness or wilful conduct of the defendant,” he would be answerable. These instructions were intended to define the law of trespass. Afterwards, it was submitted to the jury to find whether the defendant was liable on the ground of either carelessness or wilfulness of his servant, acting in his presence, and presumed in law to be acting by his commands or assent; or whether it was an accident from inability to control the team. So in another part of the charge, the question of liability under the evidence was left to the jury as follows: “ If the damage was the result of negligence on the pairt of the plaintiff, he cannot recover; or if it was caused by the mutual fault of both parties, he cannot recover.” And again, in answer to the defendant’s first point, the court affirmed the doctrine asserted, <a id="p185" href="#p185" data-label="185" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*185</a>that “if injury resulted from the inability of the defendant’s servant to control the team,” the defendant was not answerable. These instructions left the question of blame or default, and consequent liability, to the jury. The object of the instructions complained of seems to have been as stated, merely illustrations of the propriety of the form of action adopted by the plaintiff, and not intended as operating on the question of the ultimate liability of the defendant.</p>
    <p id="b185-6" data-blocks='[["BL_185.6",185,[162,746,1168,1065]]]'>As to the form of action, a question was made, but we think it is without difficulty. Trespass is proper, where the injury is by the direct act of the party, whether done wilfully or negligently. Force directly applied is the criterion: <a href="/whart/4/0143-01" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="4 Whart. 143" data-case-ids="1835018" data-case-paths="/whart/4/0143-01">4 Whart. 143</a>; 2 Bl. 895 ; 2 Lord R. 1402; 3 East 598. If the act was in law the act of the defendant, he is consequently liable in trespass, whether it resulted from wilfulness or negligence. That the law will esteem acts of a servant when done in his master’s presence and employ, without objection or dissent, as his acts, there can be no doubt. In 1 Chit. Pl. 180, it is laid down that “ trespass lies against a master, where, while the servant drives him, the horse of the latter runs away and does damage.” In 2 Hilliard on Torts 527, it is said, “ A master may be held liable as a trespasser for the act of his servant done in his <em>presence;” </em>citing Chandler <em>v. </em>Broughton, 3 Tyrw. 220; McLaughlin <em>v. </em>Pryor, 4 M. &amp; G. 48. Here the son was driving, and the father, the defendant, was riding. The latter made no objection or endeavour to control his son, and if he did not, it was a presumption which a jury might well make, and which I think they were bound to make, that he assented to what was done in the management of the instrument (the team) which did the injury, and therefore per consequence, was answerable, provided the result was not an unavoidable accident, which the jury have found was not the case, the question of negligence or wilfulness having been submitted to them.</p>
    <p id="b185-7" data-blocks='[["BL_185.7",185,[162,1822,1166,256]]]'>Upon consideration of the whole case, we see no sufficient ground for reversing the judgment. A party who acts so uncivilly as to endeavour to keep the road and prevent others with lighter and more active vehicles from passing, or strives to run them off or repass them by unusual and reckless driving, richly deserves to be made to pay all damage incident to such temerity.</p>
    <p id="b185-8" data-blocks='[["BL_185.8",185,[934,2077,346,43]]]'>Judgment affirmed.</p>
