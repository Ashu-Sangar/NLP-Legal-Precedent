H. bought ten tons of railroad iron, upon a siding of the old Portage road over the Alleghenies, from the vendees of the state, for which he paid, and received a receipt and a written order on the state agent for the delivery of the iron, but never presented it, and, in consequence, the iron purchased was not separated and set a,part from a larger quantity of railroad iron with which it was mixed. The Pennsylvania Railroad Company afterwards bought and removed the whole amount of the iron. In an action of trover and conversion, brought by H. against the company, for the iron purchased by him, it was <em>held, </em>that, from the failure of the plaintiff to present the order and have the amount bought severed and distinguished from the mass, the sale was incomplete, and did not pass any such title to him as would ground an action of trover and conversion to recover the value of the iron.</p>

Charles Hughes, the plaintiff, was manufacturing fire-brick near Plane No. 8, on the Old Portage Railroad, and had his works connected with the old track by a siding, put down with iron belonging to the Commonwealth, for which he had obtained the consent of the superintendent of the road. This old track connected his works with the new when it was laid. Some time in 1856 Mr. Hughes applied to the canal commissioners for the old iron from the foot of Plane No. 8 to where the Old Portage Road intersected the new. General Callahan, the superintendent of the road, in company with Hughes, measured the track, and found that there were between 70 and 80 tons of iron upon that part which Hughes proposed to purchase. Callahan, by direction of the canal commissioners, informed Hughes that they could not sell to him; that the old iron had been sold to the Cambria Iron Company, and that if he wished to buy he must apply to Wood, <a id="p522" href="#p522" data-label="522" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*522</a>Morrell &amp; Co. Hughes went to Morrell in September 1856, and offered to buy <em>that part of the old road between Ms works and the new road. </em>Morrell told him he could not give him an order for any special portion of the track; that the iron did not belong to them until it was delivered; but he would give him an order on Callahan for 10 tons, which he might deliver to him whenever he saw proper. Hughes thereupon paid $500, and Morrell gave him an order on the 2d September 1856, to General Callahan for 10 tons of “ Old Portage Railr.oad iron, of the same now lying upon the old road between the factory of Mr. Hughes, at or near Plane 8 and the intersection of the new Allegheny Portage Railroad, the weight to be estimated by General W.

His use of it for a purpose connected with the use of the road, though permitted by the agents of the Commonwealth, gave him no title to it; and, although such use or possession of it might avail him in trover against a mere <em>wrongdoer, </em>the defendant does not occupy that position, having succeeded to the rights of the Commonwealth by purchase.

Whatever is sufficient to put a party upon this inquiry amounts to notice. We leave it to the jury to determine whether there is in the facts thus suggested, or in any other evidence bearing upon the intercourse and relations of the parties in this business, sufficient to satisfy them that the railroad company, at the date of their purchase, knew of the prior sale of this iron by the Commonwealth.

It was held to be an incomplete sale, and, in delivering the opinion of this court, Judge Bogers went into a full and exhaustive discussion of the authorities, including the case of Whitehouse <em>v. </em>Frost, 12 East 614, on which the counsel of the plaintiff below placed so much reliance. That case was shown to have been overruled, and Blackburn on Contracts of Sale was quoted with approbation, where he says, “ Till the parties are agreed as to the specific identical goods, the contract can be no more than a contract to supply goods answering a particular description; and, since the vendor would fulfil his part of the contract by furnishing any parcel of goods answering that description, and the purchaser could not object to them if they did answer that description, it is clear that there can be no intention to transfer the property in any particular lot of goods more than another, till it is ascertained which are the very goods sold.”</p>
    <p id="b527-8" data-blocks='[["BL_527.9",527,[140,2061,1164,214]]]'>So in Winslow, Lanier &amp; Co. <em>v. </em>Leonard, 12 Harris 14, evidence that “we have this day sold W., L. &amp; Co., 400 tons of pig metal, now at our landing, or that will soon be delivered there,” was held to be, of itself, insufficient to prove a perfect sale of a specified lot of metal.</p>
    <p id="b527-9" data-blocks='[["BL_527.10",527,[136,2276,1167,129]],["BL_528.1",528,[321,383,1162,343]]]'>From these cases, and the numerous cases cited therein, it is apparent beyond all reasonable controversy, that by failing to present his order to Callahan, and to have his ten tons severed <a id="p528" href="#p528" data-label="528" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*528</a>and distinguished from the mass with which they were mixed, the plaintiff below failed to complete any such title in himself as would ground an action of trover and conversion. The court ought so to have instructed the jury. The facts upon this part of the case were few, and undisputed. There was no conflicting evidence on the point of delivery under Morrell’s order. And, without that point well proved, the court ought to have told the jury the plaintiff had no case.</p>
    <p id="b528-5" data-blocks='[["BL_528.6",528,[319,727,1160,330]]]'>It is not necessary to discuss the question of notice. Eor, if there was evidence to affect the company with notice of the rights of Hughes, and Hughes had no title, the notice was nothing. If the company knew every fact which goes to make what title Hughes exhibited, and full notice can imply no more title than was proved, the question still would be whether these facts constitute a title in law. Clearly, they do not, and that seems to end the case.</p>
    <p id="b528-6" data-blocks='[["BL_528.7",528,[318,1067,1163,215]]]'>For the same reason that the question of notice becomes unimportant, it is not necessary to discuss the purchase by the railroad company. Neither the state nor Wood, Morrell &amp; Co. complain of the company for taking the iron, and Hughes, having no title to it, had no right to complain.</p>
    <p id="b528-7" data-blocks='[["BL_528.8",528,[490,1282,988,76]]]'>The judgment is reversed, and a <em>venire facias de novo </em>is awarded.</p>
