Scott against John A. Warner, Henry McGee, and Jared Sanford, to recover the value of a horse which was taken under a writ of attachment issued by a justice of the peace at the suit of John A. Warner, and sold as the property of Rufus Mont<a id="p275" href="#p275" data-label="275" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*275</a>gomery.

    <p class="summary" id="b275-6" data-blocks='[["BL_275.6",275,[181,509,1036,42]]]'>The material facts of the case appear to be as follows:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b275-7" data-blocks='[["BL_275.7",275,[136,551,1167,943]]]'>The horse was owned by Julius Scott and Rufus Montgomery, partners doing business as Scott &amp; Montgomery. Warner held a note against Montgomery, and had also a claim against the firm, and alleged that he had bought the horse in Pittsburgh from Montgomery, in satisfaction of these two claims; that an order had been given by Montgomery on his partner Scott, to the agent-of Warner, for the delivery of the horse, under which the horse was delivered to the agent in Warren county, who kept and worked him for Warner for a week or ten days. R. C. Scott and Julius Scott took the horse from Warner’s pasture, Julius telling Warner’s agent at the time, that he wanted to borrow him, and would return him that day, but never did return him. Warner then brought an action of trover against Julius Scott, before Justice McGee, in which he claimed $100 for a horse borrowed and kept by the defendant. Judgment was entered against defendant for $100, for default of appearance, and execution issued thereon. Subsequently, on application of the defendant, the judgment was opened, and the case referred to three men, on whose award judgment was entered, July 7th 1855, by the justice for $10 and costs, which sum, on execution issued, was paid to the plaintiff, September 6th 1855, by the defendant.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b275-8" data-blocks='[["BL_275.8",275,[136,1494,1165,256]]]'>On the 14th of June 1855, pending the above proceedings, Warner brought suit on his note against Montgomery, and issued an attachment, under which the horse in question was taken from the possession of R. C. Scott, who, claiming to own him by purchase from Julius Scott, brought this action against Warner, his counsel, and the constable, as above stated.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b275-9" data-blocks='[["BL_275.9",275,[135,1753,1165,427]]]'>On the trial in the court below, the plaintiff offered in evidence the judgment recovered by Warner against Julius Scott, in the action of trover before Justice McGee, with plaintiff’s receipt for the same, to be followed by evidence that the horse had been sold to the plaintiff by Julius Scott. This offer was objected to by the defendant, because nothing but the docket entries were offered, and because also the judgment on its face was only for the use and not for the value of the horse. The court below (Derrickson, P. J.) overruled the objection, admitted the evidence, and sealed a bill of exceptions for defendant.</p>

This was objected to by plaintiff as -conflicting with the justice’s docket, rejected by the court, and a <a id="p276" href="#p276" data-label="276" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*276</a>second bill of exceptions sealed for defendants. As rebutting evidence the plaintiff then offered the record of the same justice, of a suit between John A. Warner and Rufus E. Montgomery, on which the attachment had been issued for the purpose of showing that there had been no sale of the horse by Montgomery to Warner, as he now alleged. This was objected to by defendr ants, admitted by the court, and a third bill of exceptions sealed for the defendants.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b276-6" data-blocks='[["BL_276.6",276,[342,765,1164,87]]]'>The defendants submitted the following points, on which the instruction of the court was requested:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b276-7" data-blocks='[["BL_276.7",276,[342,851,1164,256]]]'>1. That, from the fact that the Scotts had obtained possession of the horse in the manner testified by Warner’s agent, the institution of the suit by attachment of Warner against Montgomery is not inconsistent with his claim to the horse by purchase in Pittsburgh, and does not divest his claim therein or estop him from claiming the property in the horse.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b276-8" data-blocks='[["BL_276.8",276,[343,1105,1164,174]]]'>2. That, if the horse was owned by Montgomery at the time the attachment was levied, his interest therein was vested in the constable’s vendee, whose title would prevent a recovery by the plaintiff in this ease.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b276-9" data-blocks='[["BL_276.9",276,[340,1278,1166,216]]]'>8. That, inasmuch as the award of arbitrators is not produced in the case in trover wherein Warner is plaintiff and Julius Scott defendant, it is a question for the jury to say whether the award of $ 10, as entered on the docket, is for the value of the horse, or for damages for the taking and detention for a limited time.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b276-10" data-blocks='[["BL_276.10",276,[341,1493,1161,128]]]'>4. That, if the jury believe that the award is only for damages, and not for the value of the horse, that recovery does not divest the plaintiff of the title, and vest it in Julius Scott.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b276-11" data-blocks='[["BL_276.11",276,[339,1621,1166,341]]]'>5. There being no evidence, of a sale by Julius to the plaintiff, except the testimony of a deceased witness, if the jury believe from the notes as read in evidence of said witness’s testimony in the former suit, that he had his information from Julius Scott, and his declarations, and was not present at the sale alleged to have taken place by Julius to plaintiff, those declarations are to be disregarded by the jury as incompetent,'and no title is shown in the plaintiff.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b276-12" data-blocks='[["BL_276.12",276,[341,1962,1161,84]]]'>6. That plaintiff in this case must have had title to the horse on the 25th June 1855, or he cannot recover in this case.</p>

The attaching and selling of the horse on the attachment of Montgomery is somewhat inconsistent and incompatible with the idea that the horse belonged to Warner, as it is not common for a judgment-creditor to sell his own property on an execution against another, yet he may do so, and is not estopped thereby from showing that it was actually his own.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b276-15" data-blocks='[["BL_276.15",276,[341,2348,1158,84]],["BL_277.1",277,[139,413,1169,165]]]'>“•2. It is very clear that if the horse belonged to Montgomery when the attachment was laid, and was sold at the constable’s <a id="p277" href="#p277" data-label="277" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*277</a>sale on an execution founded on the judgment in the attachment, the plaintiff cannot recover; but if it were otherwise, and the plaintiff had, before this, become the owner thereof, he would be entitled to recover.</p>

If the justice’s docket did not disclose what the plaintiff’s claim in that case was for, or if it were ambiguous so as to leave it uncertain what the claim was for, the point submitted would be correct; but the docket, defining that it was for taking and keeping the horse,’ we answer it in the negative. It was in the power of the plaintiff in that case to define his claim as best suited him, and after he has done it he cannot make it something else, after he has gone on to trial and obtained his judgment and satisfaction thereof.</p>

We are to take it for granted that the award followed the submission, and if the docket shows that the claim then was for the taking and keeping of the horse, and the plaintiff got a judgment, and it was paid, it vested the title or ownership to the horse in Julius Scott, the defendant in that case.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b277-8" data-blocks='[["BL_277.8",277,[138,1187,1167,259]]]'>" 5. The testimony of the witness was given in the former trial of this cause. He dying since, the notes thereof have been read by counsel on both sides, and it is now for the jury to consider, as of other testimony in the case. It was not necessary he should be present at the sale to entitle him to testify legally; hence we do not give an affirmative answer to the fifth point.</p>

If the plaintiff had possession of the horse, and claimed him as his when he was taken away by the defendants, by the delivery and sale to him by Julius Scott, and if, at the time, the animal did not belong to the latter, but afterwards became his by virtue of the judgment of the justice, and the satisfaction thereof, which changed the ownership, this would inure to the 'benefit of the plaintiff, who had previous thereto made the purchase from the other Scott, and it would be therefore immaterial whether he had the actual legal ownership before or after the 25th June, provided he had it before he brought his present suit.”</p>

The reference was to take place before him, and if the parties could not agree as to the referees, he was to appoint them, who, after being sworn and having heard the parties, their proofs and allegations, were to make and return the award to the justice. On this he enters judgment. This act merges the award; and, thereafter, a party dissatisfied must direct his attention to the judgment. He cannot affect it by attacking the award. The award after judgment is of no consequence. It is probably not often preserved. The Acts of Assembly ascribe to it no importance, and we see nothing of it in any subsequent proceedings. The judgment is not to be maintained by it. That is self-sustaining. Hence, therefore, it was not necessary to produce it in the case in hand, as was properly ruled by the learned judge of the Common Pleas. This we think is all that is necessary to be said, as well in regard to the admission of the evidence, as to the answer to the defendants’ third point, on the same subject.</p>
    <p id="b278-7" data-blocks='[["BL_278.11",278,[319,1401,1163,299]]]'>Nor is the second assignment of error sustained. The judgment of Warren <em>v. </em>Scott, on a note, alleged to be the same which the former claimed to have previously given for the horse, and the levy of the same horse on execution on the judgment obtained on it, were evidence against Warren’s claim of a previous purchase. They were very inconsistent acts with such a pretence, and properly admitted.</p>
    <p id="b278-8" data-blocks='[["BL_278.12",278,[317,1700,1167,386]]]'>The third assignment is no more troublesome than its predecessor. The court treated the judgment as conclusive. There was no ambiguity about the cause of action, on which the judgment was entered. And its effect could not be swept away by showing what was proved on the hearing. The plaintiff in that suit could not impeach it collaterally. To attempt to give an effect to it — differing entirely from that imported by it — was to impeach it; and the offer was rightly rejected. This view dispenses with the necessity of any notice of the fifth assignment.</p>
