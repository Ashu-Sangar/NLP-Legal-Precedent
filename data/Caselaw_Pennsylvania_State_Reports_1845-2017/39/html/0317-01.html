This duty was neglected by the captain, the plaintiff’s agent, who delivered the coal to the assignees of the bill of lading. They were ready to pay the freight, but could not do so, as neither the owner nor his representative was present to receive it. The defendant was no party to this arrangement, nor did he participate in or connive at this neglect of duty; and he ought not in justice to suffer from it.</p>

The provision introduced by the plaintiff was binding upon his own agent — and the defendant had the right to presume that the stipulation would be fulfilled — and that the plaintiff would get his freight himself from the consignee or his assigns. He had a right to assume that the captain would retain the cargo until the owner was on the spot to receive the freight, or until he received advices from him.

But the bill of lading in this ease has more than that customary clause. The consignment was to David Duncan, New York, or to his assigns, “he or they paying freight for the said coal at the rate of one dollar and ninety cents per ton;” to which was added, “freight payable to P. D. Thomas.” These last are very unusual words in bills of lading. They were inserted by the plaintiff’s particular direction, and, taken in connection with the customary clause as above quoted, they were meant, undoubtedly, to prevent the payment of freight to the master of the canal-boat, and to secure it to himself as the owner of the boat.</p>

Most of them put the shipper’s liability for freight after the cargo has been delivered to the consignee, in disregard of the clause “ he or they paying,” &amp;c., upon the covenants in the charter-party, and amount to no more than this — that the master does not lose his right of recourse upon such covenants by failing to get his freight, as directed by the bill of lading, from the consignee. And Lord Tenterden seemed to think, in Drew <em>v. </em>Bird, 1 Moody &amp; Mal. R. 156, that where there was no charter-party, there was no such right of recourse, and that the carrier must collect his freight' out of the consignee, or lose it. But in Baker <em>v. </em>Havens, <a href="/citations/?q=19%20Johns.%20234" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="19 Johns. 234">19 Johns. 234</a>, and our own cases of Collins <em>v. </em>Transp.

But this is the full extent of the cases. They do not decide the effect of a clause inserted by the owner of the vessel, which forbids the consignee to pay freight to the master, and directs it to be paid to himself.

Through the failure of Bagley &amp; Brothers, who were the “assigns” of Duncan, the consignee, the freight is lost. Which of two innocent parties shall bear the loss — the owner of the coal, who was liable at law for freight, notwithstanding the customary clause in the bill of lading; or the owner of the vessel, who employed a master he would not trust, and then neglected to be at hand at the proper time to receive the freight himself ? Is it not apparent that this neglect . of the plaintiff was the cause of the loss ? The rule is, that where a'loss must fall upon one of two innocent parties, he shall bear it whose conduct caused it. We give the plaintiff all he can claim, perhaps more than should be conceded, if we treat him as an innocent party. He allowed his boat to be freighted for the New York market — he knew the coal was sent there to be delivered to a purchaser — the bill of lading appointed the consignee or his assignee to pay the freight — the assignee stood ready to pay it and would have paid it to the master, but for the plaintiff’s written order to pay it only to himself-+the lien was lost and the freight unpaid, simply because the plaintiff was not there by himself or agent to receive it. In all this, if there was fault at all, it was his fault. But if we say there was no fault on his part, as certainly there was none on Snyder’s, and that they stand equally innocent, it was treating the plaintiff .with the utmost fairness to submit these circumstances to the jury, leaving them to decide which party should bear the loss. This is what the court did. The plaintiff has no reason to complain of it.</p>
