It is payable within a year, and we might have been called on within a year to enforce it, and then the plaintiff would have recovered 50 per cent, interest, if the full contract had been enforced. The Act of 1859 seems intended to require this, by telling us how former acts are to be interpreted. We have shown, in Reiser <em>v. </em>The William Tell Association, antes, p. 137, that we cannot enforce it for more than the actual loan and its legal interest.</p>
