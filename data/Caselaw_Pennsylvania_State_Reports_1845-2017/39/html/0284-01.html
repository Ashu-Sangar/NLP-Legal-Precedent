Schermerhorn, told him that he had made a levy, making, at the same time, a memorandum on a slip of paper, to the effect that he had levied on a “ <em>lot of crockery and groceries,” </em>which he also endorsed on the writs on his return.

The goods remained as before until the issuing of Cope’s execution, under which they were taken and sold. Even if there had been a valid levy, the lien expired with the return of the writ. There is no provision in the Act of 1810 for selling after the return-day, which worked a dissolution of the writ, no matter when made. But, again, the defendant had appealed from the judgment, and given security for costs in due time, and, although the appeal was not filed, still their claim is gone, because more than twenty days had elapsed between the issuing of the writ and the time when the <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>appeal should have been filed, before which the defendant could not be in default.

This dissolution was legal; they had a right to dissolve on such terms as they saw proper, and the partnership-creditors, having no lien on the goods, must claim them, if at all, through the equities of the partners: Baker’s Appeal, 9 Harris, and the cases there cited and reviewed.</p>

Even if the converse of this proposition were true, the claim of the appellees is good, because the endorsement was sufficiently certain: Wilson and Sieger’s Appeal, 1 Harris 426 ; Schuylkill County’s Appeal, 6 Casey 359.</p>

The lien did not expire by the act of returning the writ. It was stayed by the appeal; but the lien was good, because the appeal was not perfected. The sheriff’s sale was held before the twenty days had expired, during which our lien was good. Herron’s Appeal, 5 Casey 240, shows that the language of the judge who decided O’Donnell <em>v. </em>Mullin, 3 Casey 199, was too general. See also Lee <em>v. </em>Farrel, Com. Pleas Phil.

The return of the writs destroyed this, and so did the appeals taken. On both these points the law is undisputedly against these claimants: Act of 1810, § 18; Finn <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, 6 Barr 460; O’Donnell <em>v. </em>Mullin, 3 Casey 199.</p>
    <p id="b287-10" data-blocks='[["BL_287.14",287,[140,1487,1173,504]]]'>That the appeal was not entered up on the first Monday of January, the first day of the ensuing term, does not affect the case. It could not give vitality to returned executions. Individual cases of hardship may occur under such circumstances, there being now no security for the debt given on appeal, in the manner formerly required, but this does not alter the effect of .the apjDeal in operating as a <em>supersedeas </em>to an execution; it is as effectually so, under the change of the law regarding bail, as it was formerly.

As the partnership-creditor could, in any event; only have preference over an individual execution, when the entire property was sold, through the equity of the partners to have the firm assets applied to the payment of firm debts, no such result could reasonably be expected to follow, where no such relation existed: Donner <em>v. </em>Stauffer, 1 Penna.

There is nothing in the case to convict the auditor of error, in finding that the property levied and sold was individual, and not partnership property. The first <em>fi. fa. </em>was therefore - the first lien, and that was the appellant’s. Under these circumstances, the auditor and court were both in error, and the decree of distribution must be reversed.</p>
