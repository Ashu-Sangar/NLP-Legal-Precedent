    <p id="ApV" data-blocks='[["BL_282.7",282,[291,655,1169,1243]]]'>The question is whether, in an action by the endorsee against the maker of a negotiable note actually negotiated, the endorser is a competent witness for the maker to prove want of consideration between the original parties. The proposition in this form is not and cannot be controverted on the other side. It is said the witness was competent, <em>because </em>the note was not negotiated until after maturity, and the matters proposed to be proved were matters occurring after maturity, and which did not relate to the inception of the note. But the matters occurring after maturity are not any defence by themselves, and of their own force. Eor, if the maker had received full value of the note he would be just as much bound to pay it to the plaintiff, notwithstanding it had been transferred to Lewars &amp; Co., and by them returned to the payees, and endorsed to plaintiff by the latter after maturity. The only use to be made of these circumstances is to show that the note having been in possession of Lewars &amp; Co. at and immediately after its maturity, was endorsed to plaintiff after maturity. The substantial defence, then, is want of consideration. The endorser is the sole witness offered. By him alone the whole defence, every fact alleged, was to be proved. We can afford to concede that the defence, want of consideration, is good against paper negotiated after maturity, and even that it might be proved by the endorser, if the preliminary fact, to wit, negotiation after maturity, is proved <em>aliunde. </em>But we contend that he is not competent to make this preliminary proof — first, to remove the disqualification by his own, testimony, and then give evidence in chief. This distinction is clearly taken, and has been many times held by this court: Griffith <em>v. </em>Reford, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Rawle%20197" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="1 Rawle 197">1 Rawle 197</a>; Kirkpatrick <em>v. </em>Muirhead, 4 Harris 128; Parke <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0287-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 287" data-case-ids="1856484" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0287-01">4 W. &amp; S. 287</a>.</p>
