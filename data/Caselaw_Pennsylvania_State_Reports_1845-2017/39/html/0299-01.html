A few days prior to the 5th of February 1858, the plaintiff, holding promissory notes to the amount of $2300 against George Moore, who was at that time solvent, threatened to bring an action against him on said notes, when Mary Ann Coleman, representing herself as a widow lady, induced the plaintiff to take her bond and mortgage for the sum of $2100 for said notes. The plaintiff agreed to the proposition, and directed his attorney, Lucas Hirst, Esq., to prepare the bond, warrant of attorney, and mortgage, placing the notes in his hands to be delivered on the execution of the papers. On the 5th of February 1858, Mary Ann Coleman called at the office of the plaintiff’s attorney, and said she was prepared to execute the papers for said notes. Before defendant executed said papers, plaintiff’s counsel said to her: “ Are you a widow lady ? for if you are not, you cannot execute these papers.” To <a id="p300" href="#p300" data-label="300" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*300</a>which she replied: “lama, widow lady; and my name is Mary Ann Coleman.” Upon this representation made by her, plaintiff accepted the said bond and mortgage, executed by Mary Ann Coleman as a widow, and delivered to her said promissory notes to the amount of $2300. She then went before an alderman, and acknowledged the mortgage and bond as Mary Ann Coleman, widow, and delivered the same to plaintiff’s counsel for plaintiff. On the 28th of January 1860, she applied for a rule to strike off the judgment, on the ground that she was a married Avoman, which the court refused, but directed an issue to try whether she was a married woman or not, at the time of the execution of said bond, in which issue James S. Keen was named as plaintiff, and Mary Ann Coleman as defendant.</p>

For although a married woman is answerable for a fraud practised to induce another to contract with her, yet the proper remedy is an action of <em>tort </em>for the fraud, and not of debt or <em>assumpsit </em>on the contract.

That, under these decisions, a married woman is answerable for her <em>torts </em>as if she were <em>sole; </em>and that force and fraud have always been classed together, because, in both cases, the consent of the injured party to the wrongful act is wanting: Bac. Abr., <em>“ Baron and Feme,” </em>G.; 2 Kent’s Com. 149. That in actions against husband and wife, for the false representation of the wife, it was for the jury to say whether her statement was false and fraudulent: Wild <em>v. </em>Harris, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20C.B.%20999" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="7 C.B. 999">7 C.

As in the case of infancy, it is not a question of privilege, but of legal incapacity to contract, that stands in the way of the plaintiff’s recovery on this bond. The wrong done can not make the contract good by way of estoppel, and the wrong itself will not always furnish a cause of action: 12 S. &amp; R. 403; 11 Id. 305; <a href="/rawle/3/0351-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="3 Rawle 351" data-case-ids="1822490" data-case-paths="/rawle/3/0351-01">3 Rawle 351</a>; <a href="/watts/6/0009-01" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="6 Watts 9" data-case-ids="1846135" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0009-01">6 Watts 9</a>. In England, the court refuses to set aside such' a judgment as this in a summary way, where the woman had represented herself as single, though it is conceded that it would be set aside on writ of error: Clancy on Married Women 81. The mode pursued here is a substitute for a writ of error, or <em>audita querela. </em>We do not see how there can be an estoppel involved in the very act to which the incapacity relates, that can take away that incapacity. If a legal incapacity can be removed by a fraudulent representation of capacity, then the legal incapacity would have only a moral bond or force, which is absurd.</p>
