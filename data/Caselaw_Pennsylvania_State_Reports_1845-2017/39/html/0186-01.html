The Act of April 14th 1832, Pamph. L. 275, did not originally extend to Philadelphia.

This view is sustained by the terms of the 1st section of the Act of 1835, which was in force in Philadelphia when the account in question was filed.

This section seems only to have expressly met the case where there were exceptions, and it was afterwards principally supplied by the provisions of the 1st section of the Act of 14th April 1835, which expressly requires a confirmation by the court of accounts where no exceptions were filed. It is in these words: “All accounts presented to the Orphans’ Court by executors, administrators, guardians, or trustees, shall be examined by the court, and if not excepted to, shall, after <em>due consideration, be </em>confirmedbut if there be exceptions, then auditors are to be appointed.</p>

The one is, that <em>“all </em>accounts” which shall be presented are to be confirmed, and the other, that when the accounts of administrators shall “be finally settled,” they are to be final only, if not appealed from.

The terms <em>“final </em>decree” are alike applicable to both original and final accounts, and indicate a system under which, without any distinction, they are to be examined, corrected, and confirmed as they are filed. I cannot see any evil consequences likely to result from the practice, comparable with those which might flow from the old practice, in which, by delay in arriving at a final account, witnesses, papers, and vouchers are so liable to disappear and to be lost. The Acts of 1832 and 1835 make ample provision for the correction of errors in all accounts, even after confirmation, by allowing an appeal within three years, to this court, in which the rule of distinction is prescribed in the last named act to be “ as to justice and right may belong.” Besides this, a bill of review for specific error is allowed by the Act of 1840, at any time within five years.
