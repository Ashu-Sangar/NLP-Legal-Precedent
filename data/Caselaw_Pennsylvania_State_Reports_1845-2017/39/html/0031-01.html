Collins, in 1851, and while he was the owner of it in fee, he also purchased at a judicial sale the lot on Wood street, which was sold as the property of James Henry Low. The rent which is sued for, is the rent which has accrued (if it accrued at all) for the six years during which Longstreth was the owner of the Wood street lot, and prior to his assignment of the rent to the plaintiff below. During the entire period for which rent is claimed, Longstreth was the owner of both the lot on Wood street and of the rent (if there was any) issuing out of it.</p>

If the ground-<a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>rent were a <em>rent-charge, </em>and not a rent service, there would be no question that it would not be apportionable, and therefore that it would be extinguished; but inasmuch as a ground-rent in Pennsylvania is decided to be a <em>rent service, </em>which is apportionable by law, the plaintiff below claims that there is in this case no merger, except as to the Wood street lot; and this would, perhaps, have been the case, but for Low’s covenant to extinguish, and to indemnify and save harmless, James, his heirs and assigns, from any payment or distraint on account thereof. The intention of Low, in making this covenant, must have been to charge his Wood street lot with the whole rent, for in no other way, except by absolute payment, could his covenant be made available for the exoneration of the lot conveyed to James; so that as between James and his heirs and assigns, and Low and his heirs and assigns, the rent was, by that covenant, contracted in its lien to the Wood street lot. Hartshorne and his grantees, owners of the rent, so long as they merely held the rent, may not have been bound by this covenant; but if they had distrained for rent in arrear on the Wood street lot, and Low, or his assigns, had been thereby compelled to pay the whole of such arrears, neither he nor they could have had contribution from James or his assigns. The effect of the covenant to James, was to charge the whole of the rent on the Wood street lot; and if Low, in his lifetime, had, by any means, become the owner in fee of the said rent, it seems that by force of his covenant, the whole rent would, <em>eo instanti, </em>have merged and become extinguished; nor could it ever afterwards, by any act of his, have been revived, so as to bind the Carlton street lot, without the consent of the owner. If the purchase by Low, of the rent, would have produced this effect, it is submitted, that the union of Low’s title to the lot, with the title to the ground-rent, taking place in the person of Longstreth, must inevitably have produced the same effect, for it is the rent which is extinguished by the merger, leaving only the fee of the ground, and that was affected by Low’s covenant, and thereby charged with the whole rent.</p>

This, however, is not the case. The covenant is made expressly to bind the covenantor, his heirs, executors, administrators, and <em>assigns. </em>It is plainly the intention to be gathered from the whole instrument in which it is contained, to charge the whole rent upon the remaining lot on Wood street, and as it relates expressly to the ground-rent, which is the common burden of both lots, and which Low, and his heirs and assigns, were, at all events, bound to pay, there would seem to arise out of that relation, some <a id="p36" href="#p36" data-label="36" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*36</a>degree of privity of interest or of estate, between the covenantor and coyenantee; from which it is necessarily to be inferred that the covenant is a real one; that the benefit of it ran with the Carlton street lot, and the burden of it with the Wood street lot. Even a slight degree of privity of estate, or of interest, is sufficient to take a case out of the doubtful rule of the common law, that, except as between landlord and tenant, the burden of a covenant will not run with the land of the covenantor, although the benefit of it will, with the land of the grantee. But this is something more than a covenant: it is in the nature of a <em>grant, </em>for the value of the land which it was intended to exonerate and protect, was, in a great degree, dependent upon it. If the land conveyed were not exonerated from this rent, it was worth very little; and, without such exoneration, could not be enjoyed by the grantee in the manner intended, and for which he had paid a full consideration. The case is therefore within the principle upon which the case of Brewster <em>v. </em>Kidgill, 5 Mod. 369, 12 Id. 171, Ld. Raym. 318, Comb. 424, 426, and 1 Salk. 198, was decided. That case is commented on in the note to Spencer’s Case, in 1 Smith’s Lead. Cases, ed. 1855, p. 126. In the case of Holmes <em>v. </em>Buckley, 1 Abr. Eq. 27, a similar principle is laid down. See 1 Smith’s Leading Cases 128. The same principle is recognised in Keppel <em>v. </em>Bailey, 2 M. &amp; K. 517; Scott <em>v. </em>Burton, 2 Ash. 324. So also in Hills <em>v. </em>Miller, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Paige%20Ch.%20256" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Paige Ch. 256">3 Paige 256</a> <em>; </em>and The Trustees of Watertown <em>v. </em>Cowen, 4 Id. 510.</p>

In no other way can the covenant, to save that lot from all distraint on account of the rent, be rendered available; and it follows that that covenant, as well as the one to pay and extinguish, are real covenants, which run, as to their burden, with the lot of Low, if Low had the power to charge them upon it. That he had this power is plain, from the cases above referred to. To deny it, would be to deny that a man could grant a rent, or a right of way, or a watercourse, or other easement, out of land which he held in fee simple. The existence of such a power is necessary to that complete dominion which every man has over his own property. If this covenant did, whether as a simple covenant or as a grant, run with Low’s lot, it follows that the whole rent was merged and extinguished, when Longstreth, being seised of it, purchased Low’s lot, which was then charged with the covenant to extinguish; and if so merged and extinguished, then the subsequent alleged assignment of a ground-rent to Morton, the defendant in error, could not revive it, as <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>to the owners of the Carlton street lot, or operate to their injury, by cutting them off from any defence which they could have made, as against Longstreth himself.</p>
    <p id="b37-6" data-blocks='[["BL_37.6",37,[182,540,1172,810]]]'>But even if it shall be thought that in strict law this covenant would not run with Low’s lot, still, in equity, Low, and all holding title under him, are estopped by it from claiming any portion of the rent from James, or those holding under him. If Longstreth, being the ground landlord, had distrained upon Low for arrears of rent, could Low have come upon James for contribution ? and if Low could not, could any one to whom Low had conveyed the lot ? Could Longstreth, after the conveyance to him of Low’s lot, have distrained upon himself? It seems abundantly clear, that not being able to do so, he is, in equity, restrained from doing so on the other lot. He voluntarily placed himself in the position of tenant and landlord to the same land; and it is an inflexible rule, that <em>nemo potest esse dominus et tenens. </em>It is said that he had no notice of this covenant, and that therefore he is not bound in equity. This, however, is believed not to be the fact, but it is submitted that by the case stated, and the deeds which constitute a part of it, it fully appears that he had full legal notice, and presumptively, that he had actual notice also.</p>

The deed from Low to James, in which was contained this covenant, Avas recorded long before the Orphans’ Court sale, at which Longstreth purchased Low’s lot. At that time James, or his grantees, were in the open and actual possession and enjoyment of the Carlton street lot. By the proceedings in the Orphans’ Court, by virtue of Avhich Longstreth acquired title, he Avas informed that it was but a portion of the ground out of which his rent was <em>apparently </em>issuing, of Avhich Low had died seised, and which was then being sold to pay Loav’s debts. In the deed from Loav’s administrators to him, the lot purchased by him is described as <em>u being part of a larger lot or piece of ground,” </em>&amp;c., and as “ <em>extending in length or depth northward forty-six feet, more or less, to land formerly granted to William R. T. James;” </em>and again as <em>“bounded on the north by premises formerly granted to William R. T. James." </em>The recording of James’s deed was notice to all the world, and particularly to the ground landlord, who must be presumed to knoAv who are the tenants of the land out of Avhich his rent issues. This deed would have appeared upon the usual conveyance searches against Low, whose title Longstreth was buying, if he had taken the moderate precaution of making such searches. The open possession of the Carlton street lot by James, or his grantee, the proceedings in the Orphans’ Court, and the description of the boundaries, &amp;c., of the lot in his deed, were either <a id="p38" href="#p38" data-label="38" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*38</a>of them circumstances important enough to put any one upon inquiry, and were altogether so strong as not to be overlooked by anything short of the most reckless imprudence, which the law never presumes, and will not protect. If Longstreth had made any, even the slightest inquiry, he must have been informed of the deed from Low to James, and of the covenant which it contained: Epley <em>v. </em>Hill, 7 Casey 336; Jaques <em>v. </em>Weeks, 7 Barr 267; Hood <em>v. </em>Fahnestock, 1 Id. 447; Sergeant <em>v. </em>Ingersoll, 3 Harris 343; 7 Barr 340. Longstreth then had full legal notice of the existence of this covenant when he purchased Low’s lot at the Orphans’ Court sale; and the fact that he brought no suit for arrears during the next six years, is strong presumptive evidence that he had actual notice of the covenant, and acquiesced in its legal and equitable effects. If he had either the legal or actual notice of the covenant, he is <em>in equity </em>bound by it, irrespective of the question of merger, and if bound, then he is estopped from claiming any rent from the owners of the lot protected by that covenant.</p>

Such a person has an equitable right to compel the mortgagee, or other owner of the encumbrance, to proceed in the first instance against the remaining land of the mortgagor, or encumbrancer, and to exhaust his remedy against it, before he can come upon the portion so purchased.

The law in Pennsylvania, in regard to mortgages and other liens, is well settled. The mortgagor, or lien-creditor, is compelled to go first upon that portion of the land which remains in the grantor, and if that be not sufficient, then only for the deficiency upon the portion sold, or, if several portions have been sold, then upon such portions, severally, in the inverse order as to the time at which they were sold: Carpenter <em>v. </em>Koons, 8 Harris 226; Dunn <em>v. </em>Olney, 2 Id. 219.

And we understand the defendant to allege that Low’s covenant to exonerate the Carlton street lot ran with the Wood street lot; that Longstreth, when he bought the latter, assumed Low’s covenant; that if Low had bought the paramount rent, he could have collected no part of it from the Carlton street lot, and that therefore Longstreth could not have done it; that, in other words, as against Longstreth, the only part charged with the paramount rent was the Wood street lot; and that when he became the common owner of that and the rent, there was a merger, which destroyed the rent and prevented its being ever after assigned.</p>

James could have refused to pay, if he was obliged to pay a part of the paramount rent to Hartshorne. This was the security of James, and continued to be of his grantee. It was a perfect security. There can be no doubt, under the cases, that the covenant ran with this rent and the accompanying reversion. Every purchaser of this rent had full notice on the deeds in his chain of title of the right of the owner of the Carlton street lot, viz., to refuse to pay <a id="p40" href="#p40" data-label="40" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*40</a>the $26.25 unless he was indemnified against the paramount rent. Between the owner of this rent of $26.25 and the owner of the Carlton street lot, there was, clearly, that priority of estate which made a ease for the running of the covenant. The common law which held that the benefit and burden of a covenant did not run with a reversion, has never been law here : Streaper <em>v. </em>Fisher, <a href="/rawle/1/0155-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="1 Rawle 155" data-case-ids="1819355" data-case-paths="/rawle/1/0155-01">1 Rawle 155</a>; Miles <em>v. </em>St. Mary’s Church, <a href="/whart/1/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Whart. 229" data-case-ids="1829033" data-case-paths="/whart/1/0229-01">1 Wh. 229</a>; Scott <em>v. </em>Lent, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Pet.%20605" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 Pet. 605">7 Pet. 605</a>; Act of 25th April 1850, § 8.</p>

They were decided on grounds of equitable estoppel. Of course they do not apply where no easement or matter of grant is in question, or in favour of one who is so fully protected by the rights which we have shown to exist under our first head, as the owner of the Carlton street lot appears to be.</p>

If so, ground-rents will be a much more troublesome and much less valuable kind of property than they are supposed to be.

If any part of it has become merged, it is not by a legal merger, for it does not come from any fact in the line of the title to the ground-rent of which he is charged by law with notice. The ground-rent is a separate estate from the ownership of the ground; and the owner of the ground-rent is not charged with notice of the subdivisions of the land, and of the rents that are made among the owners of the ground, for his rent issues out of the whole by a title anterior and paramount to these subdivisions. And, in buying a ground-rent, the purchaser is not charged with the duty of seeing who owns the ground, for he buys the rent estate irrespective of the estate in the ground.

Afterwards, Longstreth became the owner of the other end of the lot, and also of the paramount rent. Did Longstreth by this become bound to clear the Carlton street lot from the paramount rent ? This depends on the meaning and force of the word <em>assigns </em>in the covenant. Assigns of what ? Not of the Wood street lot, for that is not mentioned, and the whole rent is not expressly charged upon it. The natural interpretation is that which is presented by the plaintiff below: assigns of the twenty-six dollars rent. It is saying, Give me twenty-six dollars perpetual rent, and I will covenant for myself and my assigns <em>of that </em>rent, that you shall not have to pay any part of the paramount rent, and that, if you do have to pay any portion of it, you shall indemnify yourself out of the rent you are now covenanting to pay me.</p>
