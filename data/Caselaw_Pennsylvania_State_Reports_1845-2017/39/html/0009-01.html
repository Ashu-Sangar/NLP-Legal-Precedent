The title shows that it was to “prevent wrongful imprisonments.” The preamble sets forth that the evil to be remedied was “wrongful restraints.” The body of the act applies to “ imprisonments on warrants of commitment,” and directs the judge or court to discharge the prisoner on bail for his appearance before the court where the offence is cognisable, and certify the recognisance to the court where the appearance is to be made, unless the offence is not bailable. The act authorizes the court or judge to “investigate the circumstances of the case,” to “ determine whether the prisoner, according to law, ought to be bailed, remanded, or discharged.” It is further provided, that in offences “not bailable” the prisoner can have the benefit of the writ only after he shall have remained in prison, without trial, during two terms, through no fault of his own. a '</p>

Williamson’s Case, 2 Casey 25, sanctions this principle. It is true that <em>Acts of Congress </em>are void if not in accordance with the Federal Constitution, and all courts may so decide, subject to review in the Federal court at Washington. But the judgments and decrees of the Federal tribunals on the construction of the Constitution <a id="p23" href="#p23" data-label="23" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*23</a>and laws of the Union, are not to be reviewed and reversed in the state courts. The state courts have no more right to reverse them on a question of United States law than the United States courts have to reverse state courts on questions of state law: Mott <em>v. </em>Pennsylvania Railroad Co., 6 Casey 32; Thomas <em>v. </em>Crossen; Carryl <em>v. </em>Taylor, 12 Harris 259, affirmed in the Supreme Court of the United States. To give either the power to nullify the decrees and judgments of the other, would inevitably lead to conflict and civil war, and would destroy all uniformity of decision. The remedy for an error on a question of Federal cognisance is a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the United States. A state court cannot nullify the judgment of a District Court of the United States <em>even on the ground of a want of jurisdiction. </em>That can be done by the Supreme Court of the United States alone. This very question, if not fully settled before, was certainly put to rest by the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Ableman <em>v. </em>Booth and The United States <em>v. </em>Booth, 21 Howard’s U. S. Rep. 523. This decision was given on writs of error to the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, reported in 3 Wisconsin Reports 157, in the matter of Booth &amp; Rycraft, and in 4 Wisconsin Reports 163, in the names of Bagnall <em>v. </em>Ableman. And yet these two decisions of a state court thus reversed and annulled in 1858, are cited in 1860 by the counsel of the plaintiff as settling “ the right of a state court to reverse a decision of an United States court on an alleged want of jurisdiction” !</p>

If that shows a cause of commitment that is “bailable,” and for which he may take the recognisance of the party to appear and be tried, he is bound to grant the writ; otherwise, he is not; and of this he must judge at the peril of the penalty. The act gives him no authority, and especially it does not require him to look back of the warrant to the record on which it is founded; and therefore, it imposes no penalty for not doing what possibly he might have done, had he inquired beyond the warrant.

No matter how wrong, and how clearly wrong the • District Court may have been in deciding as it did, the state judge could not review his decision by <em>habeas corpus </em>without an abuse of the process, and a plain usurpation of power. We need not say that he could or could not have discharged from a warrant void on its face, for this warrant is plainly not so. He could not on the <em>habeas corpus, </em>and according to the act, admit the prisoner to bail, because the warrant showed a <em>conviction, </em>and therefore not a bailable case.</p>

Persons restrained of liberty on any bailable criminal charge, are, on showing this fact, entitled to a <em>habeas corpus </em>under the provisions of the Habeas Corpus Act, issued by a court or a single judge thereof, in order that they may be admitted to bail to appear and be tried in due course, or that they <a id="p31" href="#p31" data-label="31" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*31</a>may be discharged if no sufficient cause of detention appear; and they may have redress for breaches of this right, by means of the penalties prescribed in the act.</p>

Persons restrained of their liberty by private force or authority, under any pretence whatsoever, have the same right to the writ under the Habeas Corpus Act, in order that they have proper relief, and the same redress for breaches of this right.</p>

The act does not require a court or a single judge to issue a <em>habeas corpus </em>where the party is detained on a criminal charge not bailable, or on civil process, or any judgment, decree, sentence, or conviction, including convictions for contempt; though even in these eases the common law allows the writ out of the proper, court.</p>

All cases of <em>habeas corpus </em>other than those provided for in the Habeas Corpus Act, are merely common law forms of the remedy, and are to be granted and enforced according to the common law, and not under the provisions and penalties of the act.</p>

A single judge of a state court is not liable to the penalty of the statute for refusing to issue a <em>habeas corpus </em>in favour of one who stands committed by a Federal court for a contempt; because the statute does not require its issue in such a case.</p>
