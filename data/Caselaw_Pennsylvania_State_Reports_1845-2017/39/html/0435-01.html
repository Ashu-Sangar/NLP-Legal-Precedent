The construction was not commenced within the time specified, but a subsequent act was obtained in 1857, which extended the time, and “legalized and made valid” the original subscriptions. In an action by the company against one of the original subscribers for his subscription, it rvas held, that as the act of incorporation had become null and void, by the expiration of the time limited for the commencement of the road, the original subscriptions had also become void, and that no action could be maintained thereon. A contract, which has become void by force of its inherent conditions, cannot be reinstated by an Act of Assembly.</p>

The commissioners then agreed among themselves to endeavour to procure further subscriptions, and adjourned to meet at the call of the president. The defend<a id="p436" href="#p436" data-label="436" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*436</a>ant did make such effort, and met and acted with the commissioners at two subsequent meetings, when finding it impossible to procure the amount of subscriptions necessary to make the road, it was concluded that the matter should “lay oyer” for a while.

He refused to pay, and this suit was brought against him before a justice of the peace on the 29th of April 1859.

If the jury believe that the company did not commence the construction of the road within three years after the passage of the act of incorporation, then the act of incorporation was null and void, except so far as the same was necessary to wind up the affairs and pay the debts of the company ; and the Act of 28th March 1857, renewing the charter and validating the subscriptions, is not sufficient to enforce the payment of subscriptions made under the original charter, unless the person or persons from whom such subscriptions are claimed, <a id="p438" href="#p438" data-label="438" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*438</a>ratified or assented to the same; arid therefore the jury must find for the defendant.</p>

When it was approved, the contract of defendant was in full force, and would have continued for one year and nine months longer. Before that time, payment was demanded, and his liability continued for six years more. This act merely gave the plaintiffs a remedy, and did not operate on the right; the latter being in existence, the legislature may constitutionally give the former: Turnpike Co. <em>v. </em>The Commonwealth, <a href="/watts/2/0433-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Watts 433" data-case-ids="1840055" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0433-01">2 Watts 433</a>; Hepburn <em>v. </em>Curts, 7 Id. 300; Taggart <em>v. </em>McGinn, 2 Harris 155; Lycoming <em>v. </em>Union, 3 Id. 166, 171-2; 9 Barr 466-7. To hold that the time prescribed for completing corporate enterprises, is a part of the contract between the corporation and its members, would be to destroy most that now exist in the state.
