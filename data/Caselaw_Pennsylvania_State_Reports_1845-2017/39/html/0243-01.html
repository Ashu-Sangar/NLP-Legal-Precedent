The distinction is material; for the measure of damage in trover is the value of the chattel at the time of conversion — in case, the actual damage by the wrongful act.

The court charged the jury that where no time was specified for redemption, the pledge (stock) could not be sold without notice to the person depositing it. It is true, the court said further to the jury, “ But if you think the stock was pledged for a <em>fixed </em>period of time, your verdict should be for the defendants.” But as the jury found that no time was fixed, the direction of the court upon that state of facts became of no importance.</p>
