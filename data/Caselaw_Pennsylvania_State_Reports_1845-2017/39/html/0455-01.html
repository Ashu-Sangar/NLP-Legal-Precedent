The learned judge below admitted the evidence under the erroneous notion that the ease was one of fraudulent combination, in which, after direct evidence has been given of collusion between the parties to the alleged fraud, a wide latitude is allowed in the admission of their acts and declarations.

The fact in controversy was not fraud, but something from which fraud was to be inferred. The evidence of defendant’s lunacy in 1830, and his restoration in 1848, could in no way elucidate the question in controversy, except through an unwarrantable series of inferences, beginning with the defendant’s mental weakness and liability to imposition, and ending with the conclusion that <em>therefore </em>he was imposed upon and cheated by the plaintiff. But conclusions arrived at through a chain of two or more inferences, deducible from a remote fact, are too uncertain in the administration of justice to be relied on, and are rejected by the law.</p>

That plaintiff was indebted to the Commonwealth, or to Mr. Hiester, or held other notes against Long for money loaned after the execution of this bond, or had his property destroyed by fire and demanded the insurance-money, or was in the habit of having notes discounted at the banking-house of Reed &amp; Co., may all be true without injuring the defendant in any way, because none of these acts were connected with the transaction on which this suit is brought. Nor does the fact that he had debts of his own about this time permit the fair inference that he had no money to lend, it was therefore not competent to prove the issue here, which was that the bond was procured by fraud.

It is very seldom that frauds are so bunglingly executed as to admit of direct proof. Unless exposed by circumstantial evidence they cannot generally be exposed at all. And no rigid rule of evidence can be applied to measure the admissibility of circumstances, for <a id="p460" href="#p460" data-label="460" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*460</a>they arise out of the condition, relation, conduct, and declarations of the parties, and those are infinitely diversified. Hence it has grown into a maxim, that great latitude of evidence is to be allowed in the trial of questions of fraud. The meaning of which maxim I take to be, that every circumstance in the condition and relation of the parties, and every act and declaration of the party charged with the fyaud, shall be competent evidence, if in the opinion of the judicial mind it bears such a relation to. the transaction under investigation as in its nature is calculated to persuade the reasonable men in the jury-box to the belief that the allegation of fraud is or is .not well founded. Whatever is not of a nature to beget mental conviction upon the point under inquiry, is irrelevant evidence, and should be rejected — whatever is of that nature should be admitted. And of this moral quality of proofs the presiding judge is the arbiter. He admits and rejects, under our supervision, according to his estimate, not of the effect of the evidence, for that is for the jury, but according to his estimate of the fitness of the evidence to conduct human reason to a sound conclusion on the point in question. In the exercise of this high discretion he is to be careful not to set up an assumption of the fraud, and then to reason that this or that tends to prove it. He is rather to start with the presumption that a transaction, fair on its face, was fair in fact, which is the meaning of that other maxim that fraud is never to be presumed. Two parties, these two for instance, are before the judge on a direct contradiction, the plaintiff alleging that the bond he holds in his hand is a genuine instrument for an honest loan of $5000, the defendant that it is fraudulent, in so far as it is a bond for more than $500. The <em>á priori </em>presumptions belong to the plaintiff. The judge presumes it to be a bond for $5000, because it purports to be, but he hears the defendant’s allegation and offer of proof of circumstances, and in so far as he sees that the circumstances offered are reasonably calculated to countervail the <em>primé facie </em>presumption, and carry conviction into the jury-box, that what the defendant alleges is true, he admits his evidence. If any prescript rule in the law of evidence is applicable to the offer, the judge applies it of course; if there be no such rule, he guides himself by the sound discretion I have indicated.</p>

It is always added that fraud is not to be presumed, and must be proved.</p>

Nor has the author of a fraud any right to complain of the latitude of proofs which the law allows, for it is a universal truth, that the more thoroughly an honest transaction is investigated, the more honest will it appear. It is only bad deeds which are reproved by coming to the light. When a party, whom a jury has convicted of fraud, has nothing to allege except <em>excess </em>of proofs — when his complaint is, that the fa.cts which preceded and attended his transaction have been too fully exposed and overhauled, his position is necessarily one of infirmity and suspicion. True, the jury may have been misled, but he is bound to show that very clearly. If there was evidence from which a jury might reasonably have inferred the fraud, we are to presume they based their verdict on that evidence, even though other facts were in proof which were irrelevant. In such a case what was irrelevant was harmless.</p>

In January 1859, he was heard by Benjamin White to ask Stauffer to lend him $500, and in March 1859 Stauffer declared to David Beck that he had let Long have $500, and that he wanted $1000 more. March 9th 1859, he made his note to Stauffer for $150, at twenty days — June 30th 1859, another note for $160, at six months — August 27th 1859, another note for $30, at one day, and on 5th October 1859, he made his judgment-bond for $347.82, the amount of these three notes — and the agent and scrivener of Stauffer swore that <a id="p462" href="#p462" data-label="462" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*462</a>Long said, when he executed the bond, that he was to get $150 more from Stauffer, and then he would have the whole $1000 that Stauffer had promised him. He had other transactions in lands and money with Henry Landis and Jesse Landis to a large amount, which consisted, however, for the most part in borrowing and buying. His payments, so far as proved, were not in large sums, and his neighbours knew of no large sums of money paid out by him after 8th February 1859. It seems to have been thought that his former lunacy was a fact fit to be added to the circumstances of his great age and complications in money transactions, as affording ground for presuming him peculiarly liable to be overreached and imposed upon.</p>

The record showed him a restored man. The Act of Assembly authorized the court to dissolve the commission only when he became <em>“ </em>restored to a sound state of mind.” Then the record objected to by the plaintiff is to be taken as establishing Long’s soundness, which is just the conclusion the plaintiff wanted the jury to adopt. But the fact that he had been declared a lunatic, says the plaintiff, was calculated to shake the confidence of the jury in his present mental soundness. Then it was relevant, is the reply. The plaintiff is in a dilemma with his objection. Either the evidence was beneficial to him, though irrelevant, or it was injurious to him, and therefore competent. Whichever way it be taken, it is manifestly no ground for reversal.</p>
    <p id="b462-7" data-blocks='[["BL_462.7",462,[317,1514,1157,373]]]'>The other assignments are founded on evidence that was clearly competent, as tending to show Stauffer’s inability to loan a large amount of money in January 1859; the extent of Long’s necessities and use of moneys, and the transactions out of which the bond of October 1859 arose. All this evidence bears more or less directly on the fact in issue. And if any part of it could be shown to be clearly irrelevant, it would not be a reason for reversing, unless it was also shown that it was mischievous as well as irrelevant. This has not been shown.</p>
    <p id="b462-8" data-blocks='[["BL_462.8",462,[319,1898,1156,256]]]'>The only evidence which the court is complained of for excluding, was Stauffer’s <em>ex parte </em>declaration made to Henry Connelly in January 1859, to the effect that he had promised Long a loan of $5000. On no principle whatever was Stauffer’s declaration, not made in Long’s presence nor communicated to him, competent for himself.</p>
    <p id="b462-9" data-blocks='[["BL_462.9",462,[320,2155,1156,84]]]'>Unable to discover in the record any error that demands redress,</p>
    <p id="b462-10" data-blocks='[["BL_462.10",462,[977,2241,457,43]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
