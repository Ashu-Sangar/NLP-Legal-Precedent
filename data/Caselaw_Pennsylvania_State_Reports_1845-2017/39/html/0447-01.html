This was objected to by defendant, on the ground that it related to misconduct of the defendant, which is not in violation of any covenant in the articles of copartnership given in evidence, but which is alone a subject of settlement in an action of account render or proceedings by bill in equity to account, and because also there is no assignment of any breach of the articles of copartnership, in the declaration with such certainty as advised the defendant of any specific complaint to which such evidence can relate.

This was objected to by plaintiff, because the record cannot be altered by parol evidence showing what an attorney intended to bring a suit for — that the record was alone evidence of the facts therein contained, and must speak for itself; that it shows a suit against Tutton as bailiff and receiver of partnership-money from April 10th 1855 to February 16th 1857, and that there is no other cause set forth on the record.

The agreement shows that the partnership was merely for the purpose of “ cutting and sawing timber” on Addams’ land; that as Addams owned all the timber and land, all the firm was entitled to was the proceeds of the sale of the timber, after allowing Addams a fair compensation for the timber on the land.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b450-8" data-blocks='[["BL_450.8",450,[326,1271,1163,211]]]'>2.

That, in an action of covenant, the evidence must relate strictly to the issue raised by the pleadings, which in this case were covenants performed, &amp;c. This admitted the execution of the articles of copartnership, and imposed on the other side the duty of proving the breaches, and the amount of damages sustained in consequence thereof. But the evidence was as to the relinquishment of a previous contract, as part of the consideration of the articles declared on, which could not properly affect the question of damages. This agreement stands alone, independent of the inducements to its formation and of prior agreements, and no damages can be recovered in this action, except for breaches of the covenant contained in it: Cothers <em>v. </em>Keever, 4 Barr 168. Nor can damages be estimated by the anticipation of parties. Misconduct of one partner may give his copartner a right of action, but it must be brought on that account, and the damages resulting from it shown. But in covenant there must be a breach of the covenant declared on, to warrant a verdict for damages. Beside this, the evidence admitted raised new issues, involving an inquiry into the nature and validity of another and a different claim.</p>

The court erred also in instructing the jury that there was no measure to govern them in assessing the damages in this case, but that they must be controlled by the evidence: Holler <em>v. </em>Weiner, 3 Harris 244; Rose <em>et al. v. </em>Story, 1 Barr 191; Pennsylvania Railroad Company <em>v. </em>Zebe, 9 Casey 318 ; Same <em>v. </em>Kelly, 7 Id. 378.</p>

The land was owned by Addams; the agreement was to cut, and saw, and sell the timber for the firm; but no property in the timber was given to Tutton. The rights of the firm were exactly like those of an entire stranger, from whom a matter of reasonable compensation for the timber would be expected.</p>
    <p id="b452-8" data-blocks='[["BL_452.8",452,[297,1002,1166,162]]]'>6. The answer to the second point of defendant involved the error above adverted to, viz., the identification of defendant’s duties as a partner, with his obligations under the contract declared on. The distinction is obvious.</p>
    <p id="b452-9" data-blocks='[["BL_452.9",452,[294,1173,1170,216]]]'>7. The defendant’s third point was improperly answered. The $300 to be paid by Tutton to Addams at the termination of the partnership was a debt independent of any other agreement, and was fairly to be deducted from any damages which the jury might find against defendant.</p>

What Tutton had relinquished by the new agreement was proper for consideration in estimating the damages for breach of it. The legal effect of'the writing was in no way contradicted, nor the rule on this subject deducible from Chalfant <em>v. </em>Williams, Leg.

The acts and declarations of Addams, tending to discredit, and destroy the partnership, were surely admissible, as the case stood. Nor was Tutton’s right to recover in any way affected by the pending action of account render, that extending only to joint liabilities, to the recovery of money for the common benefit of both parties: McFadden <em>v. </em>Sallada, 6 Barr 288. It was not a bar to this suit, which rests on the tortious misconduct of defendant below, in violation of the stipulations of the agreement, and <a id="p453" href="#p453" data-label="453" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*453</a>in which unliquidated damages are claimed, and which could not be defalcated in account render. A wrongdoer can neither deprive the injured party of his remedy on the covenants between them, nor prescribe the remedy which he must adopt. Beside, the action is not applicable to every case that may arise between the partners: 1 Story’s Eq. 449. The intention of Addams as to what he designed to do in this action is immaterial. His declaration shows what the action was brought for.</p>

These were proper rules, and were not like those in the cases of Penna. Railroad Co. <em>v. </em>Zebe, 9 Casey 318; Rose <em>v. </em>Story, 1 Barr 91.

The question of the sufficiency of the causes for the dissolution was submitted to the jury, and their sufficiency was negatived: Gow on Part. 226.

The wrongs sued for here could not be settled in the action of account. We have therefore to consider only whether the claim for damages for wrongfully dissolving the partnership, and for wrongful acts tending thereto, was properly tried.</p>

It is mainly objected to on the ground that there is no express covenant to sustain it. But such a covenant is involved in the very nature of the contract of partnership. Many analogous instances are given in Platt on Cov. 55.</p>
    <p id="b454-6" data-blocks='[["BL_454.6",454,[288,678,1162,344]]]'>• The other matters relate to the measure of damages. The parties have defined their rights in their contract, and Addams can have no claim on the firm for the value of his timber, other than as the contract provides. Even though the firm were to do only a cash business, the misconduct of Addams might have so injured its credit as to restrict and impede its business by discouraging customers and labourers from dealing with it, and this was properly considered a subject of damage.</p>
    <p id="b454-7" data-blocks='[["BL_454.7",454,[282,1021,1167,598]]]'>The contract provides that Tutton should pay Addams, at the termination of the partnership under the articles, $300; and nothing else appearing, we must regard this as one of the considerations of the partnership. Then, if Addams wanted to use that to reduce the amount of damages, we think the court could do no otherwise than to allow him only the <em>pro rata </em>portion of it. But there had been previous contract relations between the parties, and Tutton had given them up at considerable loss when this contract of partnership was formed, and in consideration of it; and this was admitted in evidence on the part of the plaintiff. In this there is error. This evidence was not proper either to prove a breach or the amount of damages. Compensation for the contract broken, according to its value, not at all according to any former contract, is all that the plaintiff can claim.</p>
    <p id="b454-8" data-blocks='[["BL_454.8",454,[282,1619,1167,256]]]'>Considering that the court referred to the jury the facts and circumstances as the guide to the measure of compensation, we must understand them as meaning, when they say “ there is no measure,” that they can give no definite instructions on that point. As the defendant did not ask anything more definite, we-think the charge on this point ought not to be complained of.</p>
