The specifications raise the same question, viz.: Whether the capacity of the alleged testator must be equal to the comprehension of the will he has made, or of all wills ? It is very true, that the ordinary question put to a witness, when it is wished to give his opinion, is, whether he considers the deceased competent to make a will? But there is no rule of law, no decision of any court, that this is the <em>only </em>form in which that question can be put — and when we consider that the matter in controversy is the capacity of the alleged testator to make the will in dispute, it would seem clear that the only proper form of question would be, had he capacity to make <em>this </em>will ? — for there is a vast difference in wills. A man may make a single devise of all his property to one person, or he may distribute his estate amongst a great many persons in different proportions, giving real estate to one, personal estate to another, a sum of money to this one, a specific legacy to that one. His legatees may be numerous, related to him in different degrees, or not related at all. He may wish to give his estate upon various and complicated uses, trusts, estates, conditions, and contingencies, or he may wish simply to divide its money proceeds among a few relations in equal proportions. His property may consist of a single piece of real estate, or of a definite sum of money, or it may be scattered over the world, and exist in a thousand different shapes, some parts of-it quite familiar to him, others almost unknown. Surely, a man may have capacity to make one of these several kinds of wills, and yet not be competent to make another of them. Eor a very slight capacity only is required for one, and a much greater for another. A man, having a house in which he resides, and an only son to whom he wishes to devise it, is required to know his house and his son, and that he desires to give the house to the son, and need not necessarily know anything more to make a good devise. It certainly cannot be essential to employ any extended argument upon this subject.. If the authorities assert that the capacity required in a given case is, so much as is necessary for the particular will in dispute, there is an end of the discussion, and this we propose to show.</p>

It was argued that we should have asked as to Daniel’s capacity to <em>make </em>a will. But the making of a will means its technical execution in the broad legal sense; not writing it, not signing it, not even dictating it, nothing more than intelligently assenting to its provisions, and formally affixing his name or mark by the testator. Aside from the mere manual formality of signature, which is nothing to the purpose of this discussion, there is nothing to which the phraseology “ <em>making </em>a will” can apply, but its intellectual apprehension, the understanding it, the conception of its meaning. The word “making” cannot be paraphrased in any other mode. Its final essential import is, understanding, apprehending, knowing. Hence it is, that in all the definitions, or descriptions rather, of testamentary capacity, this will be found to be not merely the fundamental idea, but the very language employed.

Stripped of these caparisons, it would read, “to set aside a will, it must be shown that the testator was unable to understand the will which he has made.” Now, if this point ought to have been denied, no answer that the court can possibly have given can lay ground for a writ of error.</p>

But if, on the contrary, it takes more wit to originate a will than to understand it after it is made, or if incapacity to do the latter evidences the greater degree of incapacity, then the point was incorrect, because a contestant is n'ot required to do <em>more </em>than to show that the testator was unable to <em>make </em>a will. Now, which is more difficult, to <em>originate </em>a will having as yet no existence, or to <em>understand </em>a will that has been made already ?

Of the twenty-two errors assigned, the last two are the only ones that relate to the charge. These complain that the second and third points, on the part of the defendants, were not answered by the judge; but, on looking through the general charge, we think it was quite as favourable to the defendants on the subject of mental capacity, as, under the evidence in the cause, they had a right to demand. And, moreover, their second and third points were substantially affirmed in specific answers made thereto. The doctrine of these points was, that the imbecility which incapacitates for a testamentary act, must approach so near to actual idiocy as not only to lead ordinary observers to the belief that the individual is almost an idiot, but to show also that he is unable to understand the will he has made. The court responded that there may be imbecility of mind short of idiocy, which does not incapacitate a testator to make a will, and referred the jury to the standard of testamentary caj&gt;acity explained in the general charge. In the charge, a disposing mind and memory was described to be “ one in which the testator is shown to have had, at the making and execution of <a id="p208" href="#p208" data-label="208" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*208</a>his will, a full and intelligent consciousness of the nature and effect of the act he was engaged in — a knowledge of the property he possessed — an understanding of the disposition he wished to make of it by the will, and of the persons and objects he desired to participate in his bounty. Is is not necessary he should collect all these in one review. If he understands in detail all he is about, and chooses with understanding and reason between one disposition and another, it is sufficient.”</p>
    <p id="b208-6" data-blocks='[["BL_208.6",208,[283,745,1169,985]]]'>What fuller or more favourable answer had the defendants a right to expect ? Their proposition, that testamentary capacity might accompany mental imbecility down to almost actual idiocy, was affirmed, and the jury was instructed to exact of the alleged testator no more than an understanding of the testamentary act he was engaged in performing. When a man is spoken of as understanding the will he is making, it is never meant that he comprehends the possible legal effect which lawyers and judges may impute to the words he employs. The nicest and most difficult questions in law frequently arise upon the construction of wills. Testamentary capacity does not necessarily include an ability to grapple with such questions. Nor did the learned judge suggest any such test. But he put the question to the jury, as defendants’ counsel desired him to put it, as involving merely an understanding on the part of the testator of what he was about, and an intelligent choice between one disposition and another. And yet the defendants complain of this as error ! If the judge had required the jury to find capacity to understand wills in general, or to construe the legal effect of all the provisions in the instrument under consideration, there might have been reason to complain; but, in view of what was laid down by the judge, the defendants had as good a chance for the verdict as the abstract rules of law could possibly afford them.</p>

Besides the mass of evidence on the part of the plaintiffs which went to establish extreme imbecility, almost blank idiocy, against the testator, there were the two principal witnesses on the part of the defendants themselves, Dr. Wilson, the attending physician, and Rauch, the scrivener who drew the will, whose testimony was calculated to shake the confidence of the jury in the testator’s competency. An imbecile who could not express the simplest ideas without misplacing his words, according to the testimony of witnesses who had known him all his life, was dying of consumption and typhoid fever. Three, or at most four, days before he died, Esquire Rauch was brought to his bedside in Charles’s house, not by any request of the dying man, but by Charles himself. <em>“ </em>I came into the room,” says the witness, <em>“ </em>and Charles <a id="p209" href="#p209" data-label="209" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*209</a>Daniel went out again, I think to take his dinner. There was one lady in the room whom I don’t know, but suppose it was Charles’s wife. John Daniel was in bed. I went up to the bedside, and asked him what he wished me to do. His answer was: <em>“ Der Charles wess” </em>— Charles knows. So I waited until Charles came in again. When he did so, he said to John : “ Now here is the man whom I have brought to write your will.” Charles told him to tell me what he wanted — something to that effect. Then he told me Charles and Ephe were to have share and share alike. Charles asked him : <em>“ </em>How much are Ephe and I to have —$2000, $8000, $4000, $5000, or $6000?” John said $6000. I hesitated a moment, and looked at Charles. Charles then told me to put down $5000.” Without quoting more of this witness’s testimony, this specimen is sufficient to show how little John Daniel had to do with making his will. He generally adopted the last sum suggested in Charles’s peculiar interrogatories, though the scrivener put down the sum Charles dictated, as if he was making a will for him instead of John. The nomination of executors was doubtless accomplished in the same manner.</p>

And that the court might have dealt with the proofs in a much more damaging way than they did, is shown by what Swinburne wrote long ago: “ The third case of incompetency is when he that is at the point of death, and hardly able to speak so as he may be understood, doth not of his own accord make or declare his testament, but at the interrogation of some other, demanding of him whether he make this or that person his executor, and whether he give such a thing to such a person, answereth Yea, or I do so. In which case it is a question of some difficulty whether the testament be good or not, neither can it be answered simply either negatively or affirmatively, but diversely in divers respects. For if he who doth ask the question of the testator be a suspected person, or be importunate to have the testator speak, or make request to his own commodity, as if he say, do you make me your executor, or do you give this or that, and thereupon the testator answer yea — in this case it is to be presumed that the testator did answer yea rather to deliver himself of the importunity of the demand-ant than upon intent to make his will, because it is for the most part painful to those that be in that extremity to speak or be demanded any question, and therefore they are ready to answer yoa to any question almost, that they may be quiet. Which advantage crafty and covetous persons knowing very well, are then most busy and do labour to procure the sick person to yield to their demands when they perceive he cannot resist them, neither hath time to revoke the same afterwards, being then <a id="p210" href="#p210" data-label="210" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*210</a>passing to another world. And therefore with great equity and reason is that to be deemed for no testament when the sick person answereth yea, the interrogation being made by a suspected person, as well in respect of presumption of deceit in the one as ,of defect of meaning a testament in the other.”</p>
    <p id="b210-6" data-blocks='[["BL_210.6",210,[344,628,1162,468]]]'>And to illustrate these observations, an old case in time of Henry VIII. is referred to, where a monk came to a gentleman then <em>in extremis, </em>to make his will. The monk asked the gentleman if he would give such a manor to his monastery? The gentleman answered yea. Then, if he would give such and such estates to such and such pious uses. The gentleman answered yea to them all. The heir-at-law observing the covetousness of the monk, and that all the estate would be given away, asked the testator if the monk was not a very knave, who answered, yea. Afterward, for the reasons above said, it was adjudged no will: Swinburne on "Wills, fol. ed., p. 112.</p>
    <p id="b210-7" data-blocks='[["BL_210.7",210,[344,1096,1165,813]]]'>Now it would not be right to treat Charles as a <em>“ </em>suspected person,” nor to set up any presumption of deceit to his prejudice, after the effectual manner in which the court put the second .question touching undue influence out of the cause; but this venerable authority shows us how to apply the essential facts of the case to the question of the testator’s competency. If the will was procured by the interposition and dictation of Charles, that fact connects itself with the congenital imbecility and dying condition of the testator, and goes strongly to condemn the paper. But more than this. Such a result, drawn from <em>the </em>essential facts of the case, shows how very unimportant are many of the technical questions of evidence raised by the bills of exception. If we were to say the court erred in every of the twenty instances alleged — that they should have admitted what they are complained of for excluding, and should have excluded what they are complained of for admitting — we do not see that a different result could have been looked for. So decisive against the competency of the testator are the main, uncontradicted, and unquestioned proofs in the cause.</p>

The first seven errors assigned relate to Mr. Wright’s testimony. It seems that Mr. Wright had been counsel for the testator — not employed by him, but by his brother Samuel to act for him — who frequently came to his office, but always in company with others. Mr. Wright says he never had any conversation with John in his life, nor could have any worth repeating. It was then proposed to ask why he could have no conversation with him, and the question was admitted under exception.</p>

No more than the shape of the client’s head, which is the subject of the next bill.

But it is to be remembered that the issue as to undue influence was cast out of the cause, and therefore no erroneous rulings of evidence that was intended to bear on that point are of the least consequence.
