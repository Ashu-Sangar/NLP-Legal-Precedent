In the German-English Dictionary, published in Lancaster, 1812, by the Rev. Dr. II. Muhlenberg and B. J. Schipper, it is said in their ‘Rudiments of the German Language,’ that <em>o, </em>when long, is sounded like <em>o </em>in <em>no, </em>as <em>krone ; </em>when short, it is more like <em>u </em>in <em>but, </em>as <em>woehe. </em>The only difference in the name of the defendant, as written in these judgment entries, is, that in two of them it is written John Bubb, and in the other it is written John Bobb.

It is manifest, therefore, that identity of sound is a surer designation of the name of a person than orthography; and hence it has often been decided that the misspelling of a name is not a misnomer, if it is still <em>idem </em>sonans: 2 Str. 889 ; 2 Taunt. 401; <a href="/cai/2/0362-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Cai.

      <a id="p433" href="#p433" data-label="433" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*433</a>“ In the York Bank’s Appeal, it was declared that the effect of the judgment docket was simply to <em>give notice </em>to purchasers and others, by publishing the names of the defendants in the judgments, the dates in the order of time, number, term, and amount. If these particulars are complied with, the purchasers of the property bound by the judgment having notice must abide by the consequence. Were they complied with in the case before us ? On the assumption that the two names, as differing in their orthography by using <em>o </em>in one and <em>u </em>in the other, sound, alike, we are of opinion that, according to numerous authorities, as well as the reason of the thing, the requisition of the Act of 1827, in regard to the judgment docket, was complied with substantially in this case, and that the notice was sufficient. The authorities have been referred to. Suppose several judgments, entered at different times against the same individual — Jabez Bare, for example — in which his name should be variously spelled Jabez Bare, Jabez Baer, and Jabez Bair, could it be contended, with any show of reason, that all these entries would not be notice of the liens to all concerned ? Unquestionably the identity of sound would determine, because it is clear that whilst sounding the same, the slight variation of a vowel in spelling could not mislead the least sagacious inquirer. The criterion is, that the notice to be sufficient to advise a person of ordinary intelligence, and no one can deny that two names, sounding, exactly alike, will primarily be taken as designating the same person, by any one of common understanding. If A. Jones was good and sufficient notice of a judgment and lien against Abel Jones, to affect a purchaser, it would be passing strange that a judgment entered against John Bobb should not be notice to affect the terre-tenant of John Bubb, when the names so slightly variant in the spelling are precisely the same in sound. Were such niceties to defeat the lien of honest debts, we must come to regard the omission of a dot over the <em>i, </em>or the cross of a <em>t, </em>as fatal, according to the old strictness which once disgraced the science of special pleading. If, in writing the name of a defendant, — Bitner, for instance, — the dot over the <em>i </em>was left out, or the <em>t </em>was not crossed, the creditor might lose his debt, though everybody that examined the record would be perfectly notified who was the defendant in the judgment. All this, in our opinion, would be extremely unreasonable; and, on the whole, we are satisfied that the Eegaly judgment binds the property in the hands of the terre-tenant, Michael Myer.”</p>

The language spoken in some of the old German parts of this state, is a special custom of this sort. It is neither correct German, nor correct English; and yet it is the means of verbal intercourse among a very large portion of our people. It has a <em>norma loquendi </em>of its own, and is not to be tested by the rules of either good German or good English.
