The final decree, overruling exceptions to the auditor’s report, March 3d 1860. The auditor had been appointed some time before the death. The consideration of the appointment to this ofiice of pecuniary trust, was the undertaking by Thomas H. White; on this alone the court acted, and that was the real security. The decree shows a precedent receipt of money in virtue of this office, and a default in. its application.

The decree was but inducement — a fact necessary to be shown — a prerequisite to the action, but not constituting the breach. The bond was broken when the breach of trust was committed. The proceedings to ascertain that were necessarily subsequent, and they might be necessary to give the court of common law jurisdiction on the bond. The bond was not for performance of a decree, but for the faithful execution of the trusts. The existence of a breach of the trust is one thing — the mode of ascertaining it another. The authorities agree that the decree fixes the liability as matter of evidence, not of pleading; <em>i. e., </em>it does not constitute a liability, but is the necessary evidence to establish it, where the liability involves a settlement of accounts in another jurisdiction: Commonwealth <em>v. </em>Wenrick, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20161" class="citation" data-index="15" data-cite="8 Watts 161">8 Watts 161</a>-2.

This was taken as ground of demurrer, and it must be assumed that this fact was not so, if material to the case, and not averred. For joinder in a special demurrer for want of an averment, if that be material, concedes that it could not be made and maintained.

But in this the court below erred, for, as already shown, the breach is one thing, the evidence another. The court ruled that a decree of the Orphans’ Court must be averred; but, it is submitted, that is merely evidence to be shown on the trial, not a prerequisite in pleading.</p>

White, under the will of Sarah Brinton, to invest certain moneys, and pay over the interest to said Sarah F., during her natural life. It seems there was a breach of the trust in a failure of the trustee to pay over or invest the money, and he was dismissed from his trusteeship, and a decree had against him in the Common Pleas for the whole amount of the money, and that he pay the same over to his successors. After proceedings commenced and before decree, the surety, White, died, and it was contended "here, that this terminated his liability, and that his contract of suretyship did not survive to his personal representatives.</p>

The general doctrine on this point was very thoroughly examined and discussed by my brother Lowrie, J., in Dickinson <em>v. </em>Callahan’s Administrators, 7 Harris 227. The conclusion arrived at there, seems to be, that if the contract of a decedent be personal, and the performance of the deceased <a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>himself be the essence thereof, his executors will not be liable, excepting only so far as the contract was broken during his lifetime; and the instance is given of a contract to impart artistic or mechanical skill and information. Such a contract could not devolve on the representatives of the deceased, for, as it was there said, “we cannot suppose that the deceased was contracting for any kind of skill in his administrators.” So in Quain’s Appeal, 10 Harris 510, it was held that a ground-rent covenant did not survive against executors or administrators, only to the extent of rents accrued during the lifetime of the decedent, for if it did, the settlement of the estate would be indefinitely postponed to the injury of creditors and legatees. The same thing was held in regard to a covenant to keep up and repair fences, in Bland’s Administrator <em>v. </em>Umstead, 11 Harris 316. No doubt can exist as to the rule in cases where the personal performance of the contracting or promising party-is the motive for the contract: such, for instance, as a contract with an artist to paint a picture or to execute an engraving, or with an author to write a book. In these and like cases, the contract from its very nature could not be supposed to be intended to survive.</p>
    <p id="A3K" data-blocks='[["BL_176.6",176,[299,1310,1163,598]]]'>But a contract to pay money, although it falls duo after the decease of the obligor, does survive. And what is the difference between an agreement to pay at a future period or on a future contingency ? The contract is to be completed, not by any <em>personal </em>performance, but by the payment of money. This act an executor can do as effectually as the testator, and it cannot therefore come within the rule of the cases cited. The obligor could contract for such performance by his personal representatives, and did so ; and whether named or not, the law casts this survivorship on them. Nor are they, to be relieved on the other ground hinted at, of the indefiniteness of the obligation. The law arms them with sufficient authority to demand an ascertainment of their liability and the substitution of new security. To accomplish this, would not require much time necessarily.</p>
    <p id="b176-6" data-blocks='[["BL_176.7",176,[299,1907,1161,386]]]'>Wa.s there any limitation short of compliance in the original undertaking ? Certainly none in law or fact which we can see. The obligation of the surety was coextensive with that of his principal. It was for final indemnity to those interested. No one would doubt, but that the executors of the latter would be obliged to respond for a default after his death occasioned by his acts in his lifetime, such as a subsequent loss on account of a previous investment, and the like. So would the surety’s executor be bound for the same reason, and on the same principle.</p>

There is no principle which requires the encountering such consequences.
