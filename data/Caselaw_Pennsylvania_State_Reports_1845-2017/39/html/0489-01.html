[Samuel P. Shour is an endorser, and on that account is an incompetent witness, for the purpose of invalidating a negotiable instrument actually negotiated in the usual course of business, before due, and to which he had given authenticity by his endorsement. He cannot be permitted to prove that the paper is a different instrument from what it purported on its face to be,] although he may be permitted to prove subsequent facts: Bank <em>v. </em>Walker, 9 S. &amp; <em>B. 229; </em>Kirkpatrick <em>v. </em>Muirhead, 4 Harris <em>128; </em>Harding <em>v. </em>Mott, 8 Id. 469.

We received this paper under the agreement, treating it as authenticated by Shour, supposing that other evidence in the case might tend to show the same thing, or impeach the regularity of the transaction. Also, because it might not be made to appear that the bank stock had ever been transferred. [But after hearing the whole case, no other evidence has been given to change the nature of the transaction, and the bank stock, it seems, was assigned by Myers &amp; Shour on the very day that this note fell due. We therefore feel ourselves bound to instruct you that Samuel P. Shour is not a competent witness in this case to prove the facts proposed to be established by him; that his evidence would materially change the character of the paper in the hands of the present holder, and although not rendered incompetent by interest (as he has none), yet he is on the ground of public policy, under the rule in Walton <em>v. </em>Shelly, which is firmly established as a principle of evidence in Pennsylvania. His testimony must be discarded from your consideration, and that being out of the way, there is nothing to change the character of the note or the <a id="p492" href="#p492" data-label="492" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*492</a>parties thereto; consequently the defendants have no claims on the hank stock of Myers &amp; Shour, and cannot demand that it be appropriated to the payment of their debt.]</p>

It is well settled that an equitable assignee of bank stock can by action oblige the bank officers to permit a transfer, unless there is some legal impediment, and in the present case we can see none, if this note is to be treated as the original obligation of Klopp &amp; Stump. We therefore abstain from determining whether this was a <em>debt actually due and payable’ </em>on the 21st of May 1860, within the words of the Bank Law, or whether the days of grace are to be superadded. The assignment was made on the 24th day of May, which was the last day of grace. Yet the note probably could not have been sued on that day, as the days of grace have become a settled part of the obligation.

The testimony could not injure the plaintiffs. They were to be paid at all events; and whether this were done by defendants, or by Myers &amp; Shour’s stock and dividends, could make no difference to the bank.
