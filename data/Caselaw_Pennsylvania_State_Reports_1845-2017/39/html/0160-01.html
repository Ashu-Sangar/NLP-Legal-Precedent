The assignee claimed a credit of $1100, loss on sale of real estate, which, in his account, as filed, took the form of a debt of $900, the actual proceeds of the house and lot of ground on Christian Street. The property was sold at the Exchange, by the assignee, for $8400 — the terms of sale being that $2500 might remain on mortgage if desired. This allowance was objected to, because of the alleged negligence of the assignee in conducting the sale. The auditor, after hearing the testimony, was of the opinion that the property had realized as much as it was worth, and decided against this objection. Another objection was made to this allowance on the following grounds:—</p>

This latter mortgage was one of the usual building association mortgages. The evidence showed that, on the 19th February 1855, the association made the original loan to Catharine A. Letourneau, the nominal amount being $2000. The premium bid for priority of loan being 35 per cent., was first deducted, so that the actixal amount loaned was $1300. On the 28th of August 1855, Mrs. Letourneau applied to the association to remove the mortgage from her property, and accept in its place a mortgage on the property of Mr. Blackburne, the assignor. On the 6th September 1855, the association directed this to be done, and, on the 26th September 1856, the present mortgage was executed by Mr. Blackburne. What the arrangement was between him and Mrs. Letourneau, did not appear; but the whole amount advanced by the association in the matter was the $1300. At the time of executing this mortgage, the assignor possessed fifteen shares of the capital stock of the association; ten of these he then transferred to the association, by whom they are still held as collateral security for the loan. On these ten shares he had previously paid to the association the sum of $110. The remaining five shares he held until the 30th September 1858, and then sold them, having paid until that time the monthly dues upon them at the rate of $5 per month. On the ten shares, transferred as above, he continued to pay dues at the rate of $10 per month, arid also paid interest, calculated on the nominal amount of the loan, $2000, at the rate of $10 per month; so that in dues and interest (exclusive of the five shares sold by him) he had, at the time of the execution of the deed from the assignee to the purchaser (viz., 1st October 1859), paid into the association, in dues and interest, the sum of $1070. The assignor also paid to the association the monthly sum of $7.50 for interest on the mortgage of $1500 held by the Franklin Fire Insurance Company, which sum is credited in his account as “ ground-rent.”</p>

The mortgage being a voluntary pledge, the debtor is not entitled to a drawback to the extent of the exemption as against it. So is it with his assignment. I have known assignments where the whole property was of no greater value than $300. It would be quite a farce, if, after the recording of such assignment, inventory of property taken, appraisement bond given, and the goods turned into money, the assignor could claim the proceeds for the benefit of himself and family.</p>
    <p id="b166-7" data-blocks='[["BL_166.7",166,[301,1180,1163,896]]]'>It was held in Mulford <em>v. </em>Shirk, 2 Casey 473, that the reservation in the assignment of the $300, exempt by law, did not avoid the assignment. The reason for this was briefly said to exist in the fact that the law created the reservation, not the assignment, and hence it was not fraudulent under the statute of 1st Eliz. All that was meant by the decision was this. In that case it was clear that the debtor did not waive a right which he could assert against any compulsory process, either on part of the assignee or any creditor. But in the case in hand this does not appear. The contrary appears. There was no intention manifested to retain, and as it is a presumption of law that the assignor knew its provisions in favour of debtors, his act in assigning <em>all </em>his property must be taken according to its legal import — an assignment without reservation — and the property having passed to the assignee, it could not afterwards be reclaimed. We have constantly held in these cases in accordance with the rule of common law, that he who claims an exemption or a privilege, must show a performance of whatever is necessary to bring his case within the exemption or privilege; the privilege being exceptional, it requires the performance of the terms upon which it is to be enjoyed.</p>

    <p id="b166-9" data-blocks='[["BL_166.9",166,[308,2245,1161,131]]]'>We see nothing else in the exceptions requiring notice. Indeed, the auditor’s report is throughout a very complete vindication of the principles assumed in it.</p>
