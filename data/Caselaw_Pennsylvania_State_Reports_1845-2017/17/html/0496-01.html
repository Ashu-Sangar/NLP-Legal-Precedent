Nor did he mean to restrain either from adding other works to those then above and below defendant’s dam, provided only the quantity of water assigned was taken by him. What he intended to do is this: that when the stream is low, so as not to afford sufficient water to keep a grist<a id="p504" href="#p504" data-label="504" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*504</a>mill, of the capacity which that above the dam had when his will was .executed, working, and one of the capacity then below the dam working also, the upper proprietor must stop for a period of time and let all the water in the current pass over his dam. In this way he assigned to each his quantum, and his right to an alternate use. It will be seen, therefore, that in establishing the fact of low water as Potts contemplated it, the capacity of both grist-mills, above and below, must be taken into consideration, as in such stage of it, each was to have in equal periods of time the quantity which the grist-mill, on his property when said will was executed, required. And it results from this, that the upper proprietor cannot, by enlarging his works, consume more water than the grist-mill on his place consumed when the will was made, and thus create a deficiency sooner, and compel the one below him sooner and oftener to an alternate use of the stream; for this would be an evil and an interruption. Nor can the lower, so long as the upper takes no more than the quantity indicated, complain of low water if yet sufficient passes over the defendant’s dam to keep such gristmill working as was on his place when said will was executed, whatever enlargement or alteration the upper owner may have made in his works. The one above must stop, whenever, by taking water enough out of the stream for a period of time, to keep his machinery working, being of the capacity stated in reference to the supply required, he does not leave sufficient to carry such gristmill below, as was on the lower place when Potts executed his will. To this the lower mill owner is entitled, by his right to an alternate use, but he is entitled to no more; and so long as he obtains this he is not injured, although his business may be interrupted. And it is proper to add, that the one above being compelled to yield this much, is not allowed to withhold it merely because the one below has changed or multiplied his works. But neither can the one below, by such enlargement or multiplication, create low water and then complain.</p>

If he did, plaintiffs may recover damages in this action for whatever period the jury find it was so withheld previous to the bringing of this suit, provided there is nothing else in the cause to prevent them. But here the operations of the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad Company must be taken into consideration. If said company drew sufficient water from plaintiffs’ side to create low water, they have no cause of complaint; <em>hut the said company must have taken sufficient to create low water, so that if it had not taken the water there would have been sufficient to work the lower grist-mill.</em>

In such case, if the plaintiffs were injured, they were not injured by the defendant, and he is not answerable. How the fact is, is matter for the jury.</p>

The first, as already stated in the general charge, is correct generally. But the jury must take into consideration the quantity of water which two such grist-mills, as have been referred to, would consume, <em>and see whether, during the time complained of by plaintiffs, there was water enough for the lower oivner to supply the capacity of his grist-mill, as it was when Potts made his will. </em>The second may refer to plaintiffs’ declaration, in which they do not go for permanent injury done to the freehold, but for loss by .interruption of their works. There is evidence in the testimony of Longabaugh, that he was tenant of the plaintiffs’ grist-mill, under a lease during the time in question. Now, renting" a mill to another gives its water with it, unless there are special restrictions. <em>How the fact here is, the jury must determine. </em>If said grist-mill was then rented to Longabaugh, without restriction as to the water, the point is correct as stated; for in that case the right to the water would be in the tenant, and withholding it his injury. But the terms of the lease are not definitely proved. There is evidence, however, that Longabaugh would stop the grist-mill and let the axe factory have the water when the plaintiffs requested it. <em>If, therefore, the jury find that the tenant was bound to do so by his lease, and plaintiffs were injured by the defendant’s withholding the water in such low stage as has been explained, the plaintiffs are entitled to be compensated to the extent of their injury, consequent upon the interruption of their axe factory, </em>or in proportion to their real injury from such interruption of that particular work. His third is answered by saying that if plaintiffs destroyed the standard for measuring the supply of water they were entitled to, so as to render it impracticable, by proof or otherwise, to determine what is the measure due them, this point is correct. But there is evidence that for a time no water at all run over defendant’s dam; and then there is evidence that the lower grist-mill remains on plaintiffs’ land, whose capacity is a standard in the case. <em>If this evidence </em>

The essential element in the regulation attempted by that devise, is equality in times of low water. It is not at all necessary to the ascertainment of this equality, that the lower mill should be of the very kind or capacity of the mill existing in 1768, and it is inexcusable injustice in the owner of the upper mill to withhold the water altogether, because of the fact that the kind or capacity of the lower works has been changed. Lapse of time, increase of population and improvement in mechanics, must necessarily give rise to such changes, and these may occasion a necessity to change the mode in which the parties have been accustomed to divide the water-power between them. They should submit to such necessity, and make the new arrangements which the change of circumstances demands. They will find that the pomp and circumstance of a judicial settlement of such matters, is a luxury too costly to be often indulged in.</p>
