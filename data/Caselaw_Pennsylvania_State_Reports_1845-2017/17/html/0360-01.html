But the plaintiffs must fail on another ground—one of their witnesses has admitted that the sale was partly to prevent creditors from seizing the furniture. This is also a fraud upon creditors, and makes the sale void. The verdict must be for the defendant.”</p>

This was not questioned on the trial, but on the contrary, admitted by defendant’s counsel. It was contended by counsel, and charged by the judge, that the delivery of possession should have been <em>immediate, </em>and that no explanation could be admitted as to the delay of two or three weeks, that occurred. The contrary has been decided in the case of McVicker <em>v. </em>May, 3 <em>Barr </em>224. In that ease, the court held, that <em>immediate delivery </em>of possession was not necessary at <a id="p362" href="#p362" data-label="362" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*362</a>all times; but that the want of formal delivery at the sale, might be satisfactorily explained and accounted for.</p>

The evidence of this was for them alone; and does not sustain the charge of the court, that it was a fraud upon creditors. The witness expressly stated that <em>the mother held this property in trust for her children: </em>and, at any rate, they being her individual creditors, had a legal preference over the creditors of the firm, of which the mother was a member. She had a perfect right, therefore, to prevent this property, to which the children had a just claim, or which was responsible, <em>in the first place, </em>for her indebtedness to them, from being seized by creditors of the firm.</p>

But the court below instructed the jury that the sale of the household furniture was fraudulent against creditors, because it was not removed for two or three weeks after the sale. But we think the court erred in going <em>per saltum </em>to that conclusion. There were other circumstances which were entitled to go to a jury in explanation of the whole matter. At the time of the sale the plaintiffs in error, who were sempstresses, were looking out for a house, to which the goods were to be removed. They did not get a house for two or three weeks, and then removed the goods immediately to their house. At the time they made the purchase from their mother, there was neither judgment nor execution against her. The sale was made 16th September, 1848, and the goods removed as soon as well could be afterwards, not exceeding two or three weeks. The levy was made ten months afterwards, on a judgment obtained in May, 1849, a period of seven or eight months after the sale and removal of the goods to the house of plaintiffs, who used them all the time as their own. A witness says the ladies took possession of the property, at the time of sale, and removed it as soon as they got a house, for which they were looking. The case is by no means rough enough in its lineaments to be taken by the court from the jury. It is ruled by the ease of McVicker <em>v. </em>May, 3 <em>Barr </em>224, which is almost precisely in point.</p>

It was merely as a matter of prudent precaution.</p>
