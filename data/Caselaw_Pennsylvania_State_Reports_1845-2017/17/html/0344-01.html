The plaintiff below claimed to have become the purchaser of the lot at a sheriff’s sale on the 1st of January, 1849, as the property of <em>Maurice Hiatt. </em>To support his claim, the plaintiff gave in evidence a duly certified copy of the record of a transcript of a judgment filed in the Common Pleas of Philadelphia county to June Term, 1849, in which Harris was plaintiff, and Hiatt defendant, for the sum of $72.80, by which record it also appeared that the right, title, and interest of Maurice Hiatt, in the premises in dispute having been levied upon under said judgment, were sold under a <em>venditioni exponas </em>issued December the 8th, 1848, to Nicholas Harris, on the 1st of January, 1849. On the part of Harris, the plaintiff below, and defendant in error, it was alleged that the claim of Harris, derived through the sale and sheriff’s deed, was based upon the allegation that Maurice Hiatt, who at one time was a man of great fortune, and owning large tracts of land in the states of New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and several houses and lots in the city and county of Philadelphia and elsewhere, procured the plaintiff to enter into bonds with him <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>as co-security for the faithful performance of the trust of Charles Parmentier, assignee, &amp;c., in the sum of about $10,000.

They were properly admitted, in connection with the evidence that the title of Quervelle was thus paid- for by Maurice Riatt. This fact did not appear upon the face of the deeds themselves, and therefore the testimony of Jones and Grier was properly received as pertinent evidence touching the main question on which the cause depended.</p>
    <p id="b350-9" data-blocks='[["BL_350.7",350,[289,2037,1159,387]],["BL_351.1",351,[198,384,1158,172]]]'>It is true that the deed to Quervelle was not produced; but the evidence justified the inference that it was in his own possession; and the action itself, being a demand of the land which he claimed under that deed, upon the ground of fraud in its concoction, dispensed with the usual preliminary proof of notice to produce it. It would be absurd to suppose that he came to the trial of a cause which he knew involved the validity of that deed, without being prepared with it, if his interests required its production. He held in his own hand the means of guarding against any injury from <a id="p351" href="#p351" data-label="351" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*351</a>parol evidence of its contents, and has therefore no ground for complaint. But we must bear in mind that the evidence given by the plaintiff touched not so much the <em>contents </em>of the deed as the <em>purpose </em>for which it was made.</p>
    <p id="b351-7" data-blocks='[["BL_351.4",351,[193,557,1163,674]]]'>The auditor’s report, after confirmation, must be regarded'as a proceeding in, the court which directed the sheriff’s sale of Riatt’s title, and was the legal method adopted to distribute the proceeds. That record shows that Quervelle appeared and claimed a portion of the money under a judgment which he held against Riatt. Although this act might not estop him from setting up a title to himself, it was certainly an admission that Riatt had <em>some </em>interest in the land which might be bound by the lien of a judgment. It matters not that the auditor decided against his claim, on the ground that the lien had expired by lapse of time. Neither failure nor success in the enterprise could change the character of admissions necessarily involved in asserting the claim. The case of Martin <em>et al. v. </em>Ives <em>et al. </em>17 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>366, is an instance in which a party was estopped from impeaching an erroneous judgment by an affirmation of its validity, made to effect an object in which he was not successful.</p>
    <p id="AzX" data-blocks='[["BL_351.5",351,[192,1241,1163,470]]]'>We have in this case a great number of exceptions to the records of judgments against Riatt. These judgments were given in evidence to prove the indebtedness of Riatt at the time of the conveyance to Quervelle. Some of these were judgments in the District Court, and others were judgments entered in the Common Pleas. The records of the Common Pleas were produced from the proper office, and proved by the clerk who had charge of them, (the prothonotary himself having died the day before); and the records of the same court that was engaged in the trial of the cause were brought into court by a tipstaff, but admitted in the bills of exceptions to be the records of the court.</p>
    <p id="b351-10" data-blocks='[["BL_351.6",351,[179,1712,1173,686]],["BL_352.1",352,[332,374,1154,176]]]'>The removal of records from their proper place is not to •be commended, because it is a practice productive of inconvenience to individuals having an interest in them, and whose rights may be greatly endangered by the exposure to risks which attend their transportation from place to place. But we are to decide a question of evidence, not of official duty or public convenience. •In many cases, where the record of the same court is the <em>gist </em>of the action, and its existence is <em>directly </em>put in issue by the plea, •the original record, being always accessible to the court which has it in its own custody, is regarded as the <em>best evidence. </em>If so regarded, when directly in issue, it is surely competent evidence to prove a collateral fact incidentally involved in the trial of a cause. These records were properly received in evidence. It was sufficient that those brought from the Common Pleas were produced from the proper office and proved by the clerk who had the custody of them there. And the records of the District Court <a id="p352" href="#p352" data-label="352" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*352</a>required no proof, as they were admitted in the bills of exceptions to be the records of that court. It was therefore quite an immaterial consideration that they were brought into the court room by a tipstaff.</p>
    <p id="b352-6" data-blocks='[["BL_352.4",352,[330,548,1159,633]]]'>The “ <em>abstract” </em>of the mortgage of the 14th June, 1842, from Weaver to Quervelle, recited that the mortgaged premises were the same <em>that Maurice Piatt had on that day conveyed to Weaver. </em>It might have been followed by evidence tending to show that it was given for the purchase-money of land that day sold by Riatt to Weaver, and tending also to show that the parties charged with the fraud were engaged in a systematic course of dealing, by which the titles and securities of Riatt were taken in the name of Quervelle. If it formed a link in the chain of evidence to establish this course of dealing between the parties, it was pertinent to the issue; and this court will not presume that the court below admitted irrelevant evidence. On the contrary, the presumption is in favor of the action of that court, and the party seeking to reverse its decisions must show affirmatively and clearly that a substantial error has been committed.</p>
    <p id="b352-7" data-blocks='[["BL_352.5",352,[326,1189,1162,985]]]'>But it is objected that only an <em>“ abstract” </em>of the mortgage was recorded, and that a copy, of that record was not evidence, because it did not contain all the words that were in the original instrument. The land bound by the mortgage is situate in New Jersey, and the instrument was necessarily recorded there. The party who offered in evidence the copy of that record, claims a right under the Constitution of the United States and an Act of Congress. If the claim be denied by this court, the decision is subject to review in the supreme judicial tribunal of the federal govérnment, where the states are not regarded as <em>foreign </em>states, and where the question must be decided as a question of domestic, not <em>foreign </em>law. On questions of this character, the state courts are bound by the rule of decision that governs the tribunal of review. The Act of Congress of 27th March, 1804, gives <em>to </em>this office-copy the effect it would have in the courts of New Jersey, and necessarily draws into cognisance here, as a question of <em>domestic </em>law under our common government, the laws and usages of that state: Baxley <em>v. </em>Linah, 4 <em>Parris </em>241. We are required to take judicial notice that the recording of an “ <em>abstract” </em>of a mortgage is all that is there enjoined, and that a certified copy of that record is competent evidence in that state. It is therefore competent evidence here, when authenticated, as this document was, according to the Act of Congress.</p>
