Pennock, to recover damages for the non-fulfilment of a contract under seal, to guarantee the building of certain houses in the village of Manayunk, and county of Philadelphia, by a certain William Harney, on a lot which the latter mortgaged to the defendant, H. B. Pennock, and w'hich mortgage the said Pennock afterwards assigned to the said John W. Tilford. Plea, Covenants performed; and afterwards special pleas were filed.</p>

It was alleged on the part of Pennock, that they represented to him that the lands <em>had been sold, </em>and that he could realize the amount of the claim from the proceeds of the sale of the land, at furthest within nine months. Pennock purchased the claim, and paid Tilford about four thousand dollars in money, and transferred to him a number of securities, estimated at $20,000; amongst which securities was the mortgage by Harney. Pennock gave a guaranty under seal, that Harney would complete the houses which had been commenced on the lot, within one year from the date of the agreement. It was afterwards ascertained that a verbal agreement had been made for the sale of the lands, but that a dispute arose about the interest, when the papers were preparing, and the sale was not carried into effect.</p>

During the conversations Mr. Pennock expressed some doubt about the sale of the lands, and he wished Mr. Rice to satisfy him on that point, but finally concluded to take Mr. Rice’s representations in the matter. I believe it was said that the lands were sold to an English emigrating company.” He further stated, that he believed “ it was from these representations that Mr. Pennock was induced to go into.the operation. I believe so; it was my opinion at the time, gathered from the whole conversation. Mr. Rice told us what time the payments were to be made. There was a specific time in which Pennock was to receive his money—not more than eight months certain; I think not more than six months.”</p>

Here the vendor induced the vendee to make the purchase by the false assertion of a most material fact—a fact which was the motive cause of the contract, which the vendor and his agent might easily be supposed to know, but on which the vendee could know nothing, and had no means of information except what he derived from the person he was bargaining with. In such a case, the good intentions of one party are no indemnity for the injury suffered by the other.
