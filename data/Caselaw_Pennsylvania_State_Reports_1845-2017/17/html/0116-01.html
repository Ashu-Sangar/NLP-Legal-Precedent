An order for the appointment of road viewers not having been acted on, the court, at the next sessions, without any reason for so doing being assigned, on the record, appointed other viewers, who made report which was ultimately confirmed.

No order was issued, it was said, in consequence of its having been discovered that exceptions might be taken to some of the viewers. At the next April Sessions, the court, on the same petition, appointed other viewers in lieu of those appointed in January. In July, 1848, on account of the relationship of one of the viewers to an owner of land over which it was proposed the road should pass, the court substituted another person in his stead, and the viewers designated reported to <em>August </em>Sessions, in favor of the road, and their report was approved.</p>

At April Sessions, the order being unexecuted, the court appointed another set of viewers, without assigning any reason on the record for doing so. At August Sessions the viewers appointed in April made report in favor of the road as prayed for in the petition.</p>
    <p id="AJt" data-blocks='[["BL_117.15",117,[138,1551,1152,470]]]'>It does not appear that any of these proceedings were objected to at the time they were had, nor was any exception, based on their irregularity, filed against the report. The court below therefore was right in treating the report as a regular and valid one. We cannot doubt that the viewers were changed for some good reason. Every court is entitled to that presumption in favor of its act, where nothing appears to the contrary. It is enough for us that the proceeding, which is now complained of, was acquiesced in down to the time it was assigned for error here. An objection not brought to the notice of the court below cannot, and, for very obvious reasons, ought not to be considered here.</p>

One was to have it set aside on exceptions, and the other to petition for a review. Supposing, apparently, that it would be either useless or improper to attempt the former, they adopted the other branch of the alternative. Reviewers were appointed, who reported in favor of nearly the same road. The parties opposed to the road excepted to this report of reviewers, and <a id="p118" href="#p118" data-label="118" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*118</a>
      <em>on </em>their exception it was set aside. After that there was nothing left in the way of a final confirmation of the first report.</p>

We are not called upon to say whether or not it would have been erroneous to grant such a request so made; but we do not hesitate to say that there was certainly no error in refusing it. The order of the Quarter Sessions is there ■ fore to be affirmed.</p>
