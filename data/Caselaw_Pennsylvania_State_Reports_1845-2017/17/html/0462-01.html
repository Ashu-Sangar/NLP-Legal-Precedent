The exceptions to the report, with the evidence relating to this branch of the ease, are referred to the jury.

He had his counsel employed, who appeared before the auditor who distributed the proceeds of the sale of the whole lot, and claimed and received in the distribution two-fifths of the whole purchase-money. This, so far as he is concerned, is a satisfaction of the mortgage. With what show of justice could he after this seek to recover in ejectment two-fifths of the land? He would be receiving satisfaction twice. We do not decide, nor is it necessary in this case to decide whether the sheriff’s sale discharged the lien of the mortgage upon the undivided two-fifths, or whether he was bound to accept the distributive share of two-fifths of the whole proceeds; we only mean to say that after receiving the fruits of the mortgage in the distribution, he cannot resort to an ejectment and recover two-fifths of the land; and the plaintiffs are in no better situation.”</p>
