A court will not go behind the action of the supervisors, in a collateral proceeding like this, to inquire whether the supervisors obeyed the order to open, in the several particulars of length, breadth, course, and distance, or not. We must take the road, as opened, in a case like this, to be the legal road. If the supervisors do not obey the order, they are punishable. The public can only act under their directions in making the road. Farmers put up their fences, build them houses and barns, agreeably to the lines by which the road is made by those sworn officers, and do not trouble themselves to see whether they have acted agreeably to the order to open or not.' There is, probably, scarcely a road in all these three counties which is opened in strict exact compliance, either with the order, or the lines marked by the viewers on the ground; and any different rule than the one indicated, of taking the road as opened, to be the legal road, would produce unprofitable and vexatious litigation.</p>

If, on the other hand, they opened the road from the stake to the river’s edge, then any erection upon that road of a wharf, with filling up, and level-ling, &amp;c., of the road to accommodate it to the wharf, although it might in very fact improve the road, would be an unauthorized erection upon such road, and would, in the eyes of the law, be a nuisance.</p>
