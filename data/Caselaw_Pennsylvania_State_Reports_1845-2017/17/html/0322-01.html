Clark &amp; Brothers and Earnum, of New Orleans, for the amount of a bill of exchange purchased by the latter with the funds of the bank, and at its instance. The bank made remittances to the said firm at New Orleans, with directions to convert the same into bills on New York or Philadelphia. The defendants • purchased a bill on Spafford, Tillotson &amp; Co. of New York, at sixty days, for $3098.77, and on the 26th April, 1845, they remitted it to John T. Smith &amp; Co., of New York.</p>

This letter was received by the bank in due course of mail, on the 8th May; and on the same day the bank drew on Clark .&amp; Co. at sight for $2500,.and wrote to them in relation to it. Clark A; Co. were not <em>in </em>possession of funds of the bank, but they paid the bill for the honor of the drawers, on the day on which it was presented, and on the same day Clark &amp; Co. wrote to the bank on the subject. The letter of Clark &amp; Co. was received by the bank on the 16th May, and on the same day the bank replied, stating the information received by them from New Orleans of the bill having been forwarded to Clark <em>&amp; Go., </em>and the second bill was enclosed. On the day following, viz. on the 17th of May, the bank received a letter from Smith &amp; Co., of the 12th of that month, informing them of the receipt by the latter of the draft in question, and <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>that they had contracted to dispose of it, as well as of a larger sum belonging to the plaintiffs, and which they had received before.

This had been done promptly by them, on the very day that the check for $2600 was presented and paid by them for the honor of the drawer, and without funds of the bank in their hands at the time. This was the first notice received by the bank, May the 16th. The next day, May 17th, the bank received from their agents, J. T. Smith &amp; Co., an acknowledgment of the receipt by them of the bill in question, and immediately drew a bill against it for $3000 on them, in favor of E. W. Clark &amp; Co., to reimburse them for their advance in paying their check of $2500. This draft was protested for non-payment, and the bank afterwards paid E. W.

It is manifest that the principal, the bank, had <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>here full knowledge of the omission of their agents, J.

Clark, Brothers, &amp; Earnum, the plaintiffs in error, responsible to them for any loss consequent upon their defective notice or mis-advice, they should have given them immediate notice thereof. But instead of doing that, they avail themselves of the very fact which it is now alleged - their agents at New Orleans defectively did. They drew on J. T. Smith &amp; Co., their agents at New York, without notice to their agents at New Orleans, that they would hold them liable. They did not even intimate dissatisfaction until the 30th of May, and they did not make a distinct and positive demand until the 30th of July following. This, it is respectfully submitted, is an affirmance of the acts of their agent—a ratification of them, and a complete waiver of their claim against them, if indeed they ever had a claim: <em>Story on Agency </em>ch. 9, sec. 239, 253, 258; 14 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>27; Brewer <em>v. </em>Sparrow, 1 <em>Man. &amp; Ryl. </em>7.</p>

In a case of this kind Mr. Justice Kennedy considers it just and reasonable that the agent “ should be held responsible <em>for any loss that has happened, which possibly might have been avoided, had he only performed his duty to the principal as his agent.” </em>And where goods or funds are placed by the agent in the hands of a sub-agent, and the former is guilty of gross negligence (in withholding information), the same careful and considerate judge was of opinion that it “ would not be going too far to hold that the agent, by his conduct, had impliedly agreed to be answerable for any loss that should arise from the default of his sub-agent:” Brown <em>v. </em>Arrott, <em>6 W. &amp; Ser. </em>421.</p>

And if a measure of liability so stringent as that just indicated be appropriate, where there is only a <em>nonfeasance, </em>how just and necessary is its application to an act of positive <em>malfeasance. </em>In the use of that term, as applicable to the conduct of the defendants, we are far from imputing to them an intention to deceive or otherwise to wrong the plaintiff. But it was their duty to give information <em>immediately </em>and <em>accurately, </em>of the destination of the bill of exchange which had been purchased with the funds of the plaintiff; and the statement that it had been sent to <em>E. W. Clark &amp; Co. </em>of <em>Philadelphia </em>(when in fact it had been forwarded to <em>John T. Smith Co. of New York), </em>was such a misrepresentation of a material fact as fully authorized the plaintiff to consider the funds still in the hands of the defendants ; or in other words, to hold them liable for all loss occasioned by the default of John T. Smith &amp; Co. Until the plaintiff was advised of the remittance of the draft to Smith &amp; Co., the insolvency and default of the latter stood at the risk of the agent, whose gross neglect and positive misstatement of the facts had deprived the bank of all power to protect its own interest. The vigilance of the plaintiff, in drawing upon Clark &amp; Co. for the proceeds the moment information was received that the draft was in their hands, and afterwards in drawing on J. T. Smith &amp; Co. the instant that advice was received that the draft had in fact been sent to the latter, shows that the money would not have been lost by inattention on the part of the bank, had it been correctly advised at the time the bill was remitted to Smith &amp; Co. The immediate direction to sell the draft in the one case, and the <a id="p326" href="#p326" data-label="326" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*326</a>prompt disposition of it in the other without special direction, show that it was not in the contemplation of any of the parties to the transaction, to permit drafts (purchased for the purpose of providing the bank with eastern funds) to remain undisposed of until they ran to maturity.</p>
    <p id="b326-6" data-blocks='[["BL_326.4",326,[319,628,1161,1158]]]'>It cannot be doubted, from the nature of the business in which the parties were engaged, the financial demands upon the bank created by the course of trade, and its prompt action in the employment of its eastern funds, that Smith &amp; Co. would have been drawn upon immediately for the proceeds of the draft, if correct information had been given with respect to its destination. And the agent whose neglect has deprived the plaintiff of all the means of self-protection, cannot be permitted to defend upon a mere peradventure. It was <em>possible, </em>but we cannot see that it was <em>probable </em>that Smith &amp; Co. would have failed at an earlier day if the bank had received correct information, and had drawn for the proceeds of the draft. Such a conjecture, however, is not sufficient to relieve the defendants from their positive liability, created by their contract of agency and the clear breach of that engagement. The vendor of a horse, who receives the consideration and engages to deliver it to the agent of the purchaser by a particular day, cannot relieve himself from liability by the suggestion that the vendee has not shown that his damage was the <em>direct </em>and <em>proximate consequence </em>of the breach of contract. A suggestion that the vendee’s agent might have become insolvent, or the horse have died in his hands, would be no answer to an action against 'the vendor. But in this case the defendants are liable for every default of their sub-agents, which occurred during the period in which they kept their principal in ignorance of the true destination of the draft. And as the failure of Smith &amp; Co. occurred the day before the bank received information that the draft had been sent to them, the defendants are justly responsible for its value.</p>
