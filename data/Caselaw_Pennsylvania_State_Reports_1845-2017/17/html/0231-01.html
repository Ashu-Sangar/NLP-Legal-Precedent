Maitland, sworn.—I am son of plaintiff; I know the house, corner of Fifth and South; my father has been in possession a long time; I know Mr. Wilcox and Mr. Farren; I acted as the agent of my father at that time. A few days <em>before Christmas </em>I was in one day when Messrs. Wilcox and Farren called. They wanted to rent the house; they agreed to take it at $475 per annum. They gave me several memoranda to put in the lease. The rent was not to begin until the repairs were made; but as the leases were to be drawn without expense to them, <em>the rent was to commence on the first of January. </em>They were to call the next day to execute the lease. These are the leases which were prepared ; they were drawn by me in conformity with their instructions, of which I took a memorandum. Next morning I had them ready, and on the day after Mr. Farren called and gave verbal notice that they would not take the property. I then took the leases to Wilcox and asked him to sign them, which he refused; I tendered him the key, which he also refused. The house was occupied at this time. There was a woman in the house at that time, not on rent.</p>

The parties, in contemplation of, a written lease, had adjusted the terms; but before the time appointed for executing the instrument arrived, the defendant gave notice that he would not take the premises. An arrangement of terms, in contemplation of a written contract, is not a perfect agreement upon which an action can be maintained. To produce this effect, it must be shown, by the acts or declarations of the parties, that they intended the agreement to be operative before execution, and without regard to the writing. This principle is peculiarly applicable to the case before us, where the lease proposed would not have been valid without writing. The action is not brought on an agreement to sign a written lease, but upon an actual lease, upon terms set forth. The evidence does not sustain this allegation. Nor is there any evidence whatever to sustain the count for use and occupation, unless a visit of examination be perverted into an entry for the purpose of enjoyment. The plaintiff was properly non-suited.</p>
