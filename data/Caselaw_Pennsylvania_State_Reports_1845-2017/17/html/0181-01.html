In 1837, two of the executors having died, the surviving executor and the executors of the second deceased executor settled an account, in which they were charged with the balance due on the <em>first </em>account, and resulting in an increased balance in favor of the estate of the first decedent. In 1847, an account was settled by the surviving executor, in which he charged himself with the balance on the <em>second </em>account. It was <em>held, </em>that the surviving executor, in the distribution of the balance decreed on the last account, could not set off the amount of the one-third of the balance on the first account against the claim of the wife of the first deceased executor, who claimed under the will of her father, the first testator, who had devised to her the <em>interest </em>only of the amount in dispute, and the principal sum to her children. The whole of the balance was, on the face of the third account, admitted to be in the hands of the surviving executor. The claim of the surviving executor against the husband of the claimant was but an ordinary debt, which, if recoverable in the Orphans’ Court, could only be recovered in the distribution of the husband’s estate; and nearly <em>thirty years </em>having elapsed since the settlement of the <em>first </em>account, the claim was barred by the statute of limitations. It could not be treated as a payment to the husband <a id="p182" href="#p182" data-label="182" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*182</a>of liis wife’s legacy, because the principal sum was not payable either to the husband or wife; and because it could not consistently with the proceedings be presumed to have been received by the husband, as the last executor had charged himself with it, as being in his hands at the exhibition of his last account.</p>

She has therefore in effect had the full use of her share since 1824, being equal in value to all she can claim up to this time.

The court thinks it inequitable therefore at present to compel this accountant to pay her the interest of the share awarded in her name in this distribution, and accordingly orders the clerk to deduct first from the whole fund the expenses of the second audit, and so proportionally reduce each distributive share; and then it orders David Acuff, the accountant, to pay, or vest, taking mortgage for security, each share as directed in the report; but allows him to .take the interest of the share described as Sarah Haage’s for his own use, annually, until further orders from the court.

In 1818, he joined his two co-executors, David Acuff and Casper Schlater, in a settlement, whereby there appeared a balance due the estate of their testator of $5490.13. On the face of this settlement, George Haage would be liable to account to his co-executors for one equal third of the amount of the balance, to wit, the sum of $1830.04. But after his decease, to wit, on the 13th of March, 1824, it was settled by an account made out by <em>Ms </em>executors, and the two surviving executors of Jacob Acuff, deceased, that the true amount which was in the hands of George Haage at the time of his decease, belonging to the estate of his testator, was $1267.25, with interest thereon from April 1, 1823. Now, with this sum of $1267.25, David Acuff, as surviving executor of the will of Jacob Acuff, was charged in his subsequent settlements, and it forms part of the balance of $15,428.49, which was finally decreed against him, as being the fund in his hands for distribution, and to the one-tenth part of which, after deducting advancement, amounting to the sum of $1041.79, Sarah Haage would have been entitled, but for the circumstance that the money <em>had never come into the hands of David Acuff, </em>but had been received by her own <a id="p190" href="#p190" data-label="190" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*190</a>husband in his lifetime, had been bequeathed by him in his will <em>to </em>her, and had been actually received by her from his executors!

For all the purposes of the case, however, it is immaterial whether the former or the latter sum be regarded as the correct amount. The “ share of Sarah Haage,” as ascertained by the auditor in 1850, was $1041.79, whereas, $653.28, with interest thereon from 1824 to 1850, a period of twenty-six years, would amount to the sum of $1772.22, showing still <em>a loss </em>on <em>the </em>part of David Acuff to the amount of $730.43.

By that decree the alleged balance of $1267.25 ceased to be a debt to the estate of Jacob Acuff; and if it remains as a debt at all, it is a debt to David Acuff individually, and not in his character as executor; because he was forced as a joint debtor to take it all on himself, and the executors of George Haage were, as to the estate of Jacob Acuff, discharged from it.</p>

Can it be treated as a payment to him of his wife’s share? This is impossible. If he had had a right to receive it for her, it might possibly have been presumed that he had so received it. But it is a fact, shown by the will of Jacob Acuff and by the state of the accounts, that neither he nor she had any right then to receive even the interest of it. Moreover it cannot, consistently with other circumstances, be presumed to have been thus received or retained; for in 1837 and in 1847 the claimant, David Acuff, charges himself in his accounts with having this very money still in his hands, and because it is perfectly apparent that he received it as executor.

David Acuff settles two accounts in which no notice is taken of it, though it is included in the general balance declared to be due by himself. And besides this, the executors of the real debtor, George Haage, settled their accounts in 1845, and it was not claimed there. Under such circumstances of incompatible acts and negligence, it would be most dangerous to the principles of administrative justice to enforce this claim.
