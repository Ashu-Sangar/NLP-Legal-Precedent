      <em>Moses Keech </em>was the father of John Keech. In the spring of the year 1849, John borrowed of one Benjamin Hayes the sum of $2200, and executed to him his bond for that amount, on which Moses Keech became surety. Hayes entered judgment on the bond against the Keeches. At the time this money was borrowed, it was known to all the parties that $700 of it were intended for the payment of a lien on a house owned by John Keech in Biddle' street, and it was so applied. Another portion of it was' to pay a debt due by Keech to U. Y. Pennypacker, Esq.; but it was alleged Keech failed in that engagement, and appropriated the principal part of the balance of the $2200 to the business of the firm. For the purpose of indemnifying Moses Keech from any loss as surety on the said bond, John Keech gave him a judgment-bond conditioned for the payment of $2200 in ten days with interest, and with the understanding that it was to be placed in Mr. Pennypacker’s hands, and if necessary execution was to be issued and levied on the store goods. This bond remained in Mr. Pennypacker’s hands until the 24th of December, 1849, when judgment was entered upon it and execution issued; Mr. Pennypacker acting as the attorney of Moses Keech.</p>

She became dissatisfied, and wanted her money; he, therefore, on the 12th of December, 1849, gave her a bill single for $510, with warrant of attorney to confess judgment, payable in five days, with interest. TMs amount included all, principal and interest, that was owing to her, whether by himself or the firm. Mr. Pennypacker was her counsel.</p>
