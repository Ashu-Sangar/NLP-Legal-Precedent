Credits have been given upon recognisances, under the authority of this court, in repeated instances; yet in every one of those cases, it is believed to have been done, not because the court possessed the power to make the decree <em>in invitum, </em>but because it was an amicable arrangement between the heirs and the reeognisor; there was consequently no opposition to the action of the court, and the practice, such as it was, passed <em>sub silentio. </em>It was probably deemed the least circuitous, expensive, and troublesome way of reaching an end that could have been reached perhaps after partition, and within seven or five years after the death of the decedent, as the case happened to fall under § IY.

There Yohe, who was largely indebted to the estate of his deceased father-in-law, upon partition and valuation of the real estate of his father-in-law, claimed that his wife’s share of that estate should not be paid to the administrators in satisfaction of his debt. This was <em>before </em>the recognisance and bonds to the heirs were executed, and the Supreme Court, that being the condition of the matter, could see no reason why the Orphans’ Court might not deduct what appeared to be due from him to the other heirs. It was necessary to do this, in order to ascertain what his share, if anything, of that real estate was, over and above his indebtedness, and that before the bonds and recognisance were executed for in the words of the Chief Justice, if he once got hold of the money or the bond, there was reason to fear that payment of his debt would never be obtained. It would then, in the view of the Chief Justice, be too late to make the deduction <em>after </em>the execution of the recognisance.

The court below, therefore, in dismissing the petition for want of general jurisdiction over the subject-matter, did so for what we think an erroneous reason.</p>
    <p id="b126-7" data-blocks='[["BL_126.9",126,[319,897,1151,685]]]'>But, under the circumstances of this case, it was necessary that the petition should contain something more than the mere bald statement of the amounts due respectively on the recognisance and on the account. The intestate died in 1833. His debts were liens on his land for seven years. The administration account was filed and confirmed in 1846. It is manifest, from these dates, that the balance in favor of the accountant may have been produced by credits for the payment of debts whose liens on the land have expired long since. Such, indeed, is the presumption of law, in the absence both of allegation and proof to the contrary. If the fact was otherwise the petition should have particularized the debts, described their nature, and set forth the acts by which their liens had been continued. This not having been done, the record before us discloses no case which entitles the plaintiff to the relief he has asked for. The decree of the Orphans’ Court, dismissing the petition, is therefore affirmed.</p>
