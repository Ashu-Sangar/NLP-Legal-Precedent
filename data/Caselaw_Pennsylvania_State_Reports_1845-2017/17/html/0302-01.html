The testimony mainly relied upon to take the claim out of the statute was that of Dr. W. II. Gillingham, who said, “ within two years, Joseph (the defendant) called on me several times about a settlement between him and Thomas. In reference to the note in suit, he said, “ I acknowledge I owe the money; I acknowledge I got the money of Thomas, and I intend to pay it. But it was not Thomas’s money. It is my impression that legally it is Stacey’s money. Equitably it is John’s.”</p>
