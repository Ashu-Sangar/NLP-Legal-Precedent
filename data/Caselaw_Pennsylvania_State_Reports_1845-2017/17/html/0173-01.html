It is the business of the jury to find them from all the testimony in the case. In law it is the right of a riparian owner above a water power, mill, or factory below him, to erect any dam on the stream in question, and take a reasonable time in doing so; and he may construct it as high, in such form, and continue it for such period as he may think proper. Put in doing so he must take care not unnecessarily to injure the one below him by withholding the water an unreasonable.time, or otherwise unnecessarily interrupting him in the business which he has depending upon the stream and its use. The defendants, however, have submitted eleven points to the court for specific direction. As to the 1st the court 'has already sai-d, that erecting and continuing the dam as distinct acts are not wrongful nor unlawful, and this principle is here repeated. But if in doing so the defendants unnecessarily and unreasonably detained the water of the stream from the plaintiff, and to his injury, the verdict must not be for the defendants. In such case the plaintiff would be entitled under his <em>narr., </em>to some damages at all events: Pastorius <em>v. </em>Fisher, 1 <em>It. </em>27. The 2d point is affirmed; and the 8d is also affirmed if the jury find from the evidence that what is stated in it, and no more, is the case. But then if they find also that during the time laid in the <em>narr. </em>the dam was altered, repaired, or reconstructed, and in doing so defendants kept back the water longer than was reasonably necessary, to plaintiff’s injury, the court dissents from it, and the plaintiff can recover. The 4th is affirmed as a naked proposition; and so is the 5th, provided the inconvenience is no more than a necessary result from the execution of the work in a reasonable way and time. To the 6th the court replies that it is not correct, if the jury finds that the defendants acted unreasonably. The law does not compensate for <em>wanton </em>injury only, hut also for such as re-<a id="p176" href="#p176" data-label="176" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*176</a>suits from acts that show indifference in regard .to the rights of others; and if the jury find that, though the defendants had no positive desire to injure plaintiff, yet did injure him by an unreasonable or unnecessary detention of the water of the stream, the verdict must be for plaintiff. The 7th is answered by saying that under the evidence it makes no difference whether Mr. Morris was owner or not, if he took part in the matters complained of, and so did injury to plaintiff, as already explained by the court. The 8th is true, if Mr. Edwards had no hand in the construction of the dam which is alleged to have been done prior to the time laid in the narr.; but it is otherwise if he had a hand in its reconstruction, as already instanced and explained, and which the jury will recollect. The 9th- is true, if it is intended to say that it is done in an ordinary reasonable way; but it is not true if it is meant to express a right to pen back the water an unreasonable time, and then let it down on the works below him in extraordinary and unreasonable quantities, so as to do injury to the lower owner or tenant. The 10th and llth may be answered together, and are affirmed by the court as general propositions. There is, however, no evidence in the case that Morris had authority to make a lease of the premises other than his being the husband of the owner. But whether Mr. Morris was landlord and Mr. Edwards tenant or not can make no difference in this case, if the jury find that they ordered and directed the execution of the work about the dam in the time laid in the narr., and detained the water from plaintiff longer than was necessary and reasonable to complete it, or otherwise produced injury to him by that means which might reasonably have been avoided.</p>

The amendment therefore introduced a new and distinct cause of action, and should not have been allowed by the court: Wilson <em>v. </em>Wallace, 8 <em>Ser. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>43; Cassel <em>v. </em>Cooke, 8 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>287; Newlin <em>v. </em>Palmer, 11 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>98.

Under the original <em>narr. </em>in this case, it is clear that the plaintiff on the trial would have been confined to evidence as to the lawfulness of the dam and the detention of the water; under the amended <em>narr. </em>his evidence related in part to a totally different cause of action, to wit, the superabundance with which the water was supplied to his mill.</p>

      <a id="p178" href="#p178" data-label="178" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*178</a>As to third assignment: The first point was in substance, that the act of erecting the dam by the defendants was a lawful act, and therefore the plaintiff was not entitled to recover, under the declaration in the case. Now that the dam was a lawful one was conceded by the court in their charge to the jury; and yet the effect of the verdict is to compel the defendants to take it down. The declaration is for a nuisance; it is in exact conformity with the precedents for a nuisance, and strikes directly at the right of the owner of the premises to erect or continue the dam. The danger therefore is, that if the judgment on the verdict be suffered to remain and not be reversed, Mrs. Morris will be deprived of the dam altogether, and of all right to use the stream for the purposes of her mill. The court ought therefore to have charged the jury that under the <em>narr. </em>as filed, the plaintiff was not entitled to recover.</p>
    <p id="b178-6" data-blocks='[["BL_178.4",178,[295,1042,1165,716]]]'>The remaining points may be considered together. The general ground taken by the defendants was, that under any circumstances the jury must find that the defendants had acted unreasonably or wantonly, or no verdict could be found against them. This position the court denied, and charged the jury, that “The law does not compensate for <em>wanton </em>injury only, but also for such as results from acts that show indifference in regard to the rights of others ; and if the jury find that though the defendants had no positive desire to injure plaintiff, they yet did injure him by an unreasonable or unnecessary detention of the water of the stream, the verdict must be for the plaintiff.” Now the general rule, it is submitted, is, that in a ease like the one in question, the plaintiff is not entitled to recover, unless he can show that the water is detained from him vexatiously or maliciously: Hoy <em>v. </em>Sterritt, <a href="/watts/2/0327-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Watts 327" data-case-ids="1840073" data-case-paths="/watts/2/0327-01">2 <em>Watts </em>327</a>; 3 <em>Caine’s Rep. </em>312, Palmer <em>v. </em>Milligan; <a href="/citations/?q=17%20Johns.%20Rep.%20306" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="17 Johns.

Among the many decisions on this point, Hart <em>v. </em>Evans, 8 <em>Barr </em>28, is the last. In the case at bar, the water was kept back in the day time, and rushed down in the night time and on Sundays, the consequence of which was to prevent the plaintiff from using his cotton factory, or to compel him to procure other power or stand still; hence it comes directly <a id="p179" href="#p179" data-label="179" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*179</a>within Hart <em>v. </em>Evans, that “ the tortious act is itself the grave-men of the action, the necessarily resulting injuries being only the measure' of the damages.” See Lloyd <em>v. </em>McGarr, 3 <em>Barr </em>482-3, where the same thing is held by the Chief Justice.

    <p id="b180-9" data-blocks='[["BL_180.7",180,[326,1383,1157,341]]]'>And why should we not allow it ? Our statute of amendments declares a valuable principle, when it requires that no suit “shall be set aside for an informality;” and this improper averment is a mere informality, if it has not entered into the merits of the cause before the jury. Our judicial decisions have declared the same principle a thousand times; and those cases where amendments have been allowed even after error brought are very numerous, and have especial weight in this question.</p>
    <p id="b180-10" data-blocks='[["BL_180.8",180,[326,1724,1151,384]]]'>And what are all our decisions, by which errors are declared to be cured by verdict, but a form of amendment; that is, treating, in the court of errors, as amended, what ought to have been amended? When in trespass the want of the word “unlawfully” is said to be cured by verdict: Kerr <em>v. </em>Sharp, 14 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>399; it is not easy to see a good reason why the improper insertion of similar words may not be cured by actually striking them out, especially when this is considered necessary in order to provide against a future unintended effect.</p>
    <p id="b180-11" data-blocks='[["BL_180.9",180,[324,2108,1154,295]],["BL_181.1",181,[149,417,1160,172]]]'>This court sometimes amends the record of the court below: Peddle <em>v. </em>Hollinshed, 9 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>277; Jameson <em>v. </em>Pomroy, 9 <em>Penna. St. Rep. </em>230; and sometimes sends it back to the court below to be amended. But when the propriety of the amendment is entirely apparent, it seems a useless form to send the record back; and in the case of Wampler <em>v. </em>Shissler, 1 <em>W. </em>&amp; <em>Ser. </em>365, an amendment of the declaration was allowed in this court, and is <a id="p181" href="#p181" data-label="181" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*181</a>justified by Mr. Justice Kennedy in an argument that needs no support from us. The amendment asked for will be allowed in this case; but the mispleading of the plaintiff below has given occasion to the writ of error, and he should pay the costs of it.</p>
    <p id="b181-5" data-blocks='[["BL_181.4",181,[152,590,1157,385]]]'>It is possible that the learned judge of the court below did not speak with entire accuracy when he instructed the jury, that “ the law does not compensate for wanton injury only, but also for such as results from acts that show indifference to the rights of others.” His meaning, however, appears very plainly and rightly when he adds, that “if the jury find that, though the defendants had no positive desire to injure the plaintiff, and yet did injure him by an unreasonable and unnecessary detention of the water, the verdict must be for the plaintiff.”</p>
    <p id="b181-6" data-blocks='[["BL_181.5",181,[152,974,1159,122]]]'>We shall direct this declaration to be amended as already indicated, and shall then affirm the judgment at the cost of the defendant in error.</p>
    <p id="b181-7" data-blocks='[["BL_181.6",181,[282,1104,1027,518]]]'>January 5, 1852. This cause came on to be heard on the assignment of error, and was argued by counsel, and thereupon it is ordered that the declaration brought up here, as part of the. record, be amended by striking out the words wrongfully and injuriously wherever they are applied to the erection and maintenance of the dam of the defendant below; and this having been done by the Prothonotary, it is ordered, adjudged, and decreed, that the judgment of the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery county be affirmed, and that the defendant in error pay the costs in this court.</p>
