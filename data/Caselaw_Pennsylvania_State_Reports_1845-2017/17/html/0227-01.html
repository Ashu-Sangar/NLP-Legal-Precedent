Neely, to July T.,1849, to recover from him several sums of money, amounting together to the sum of $1189, and interest, $100 of which was secured by a due-bill, $1000 by a promissory note, and $98 a balance on book account. The plaintiff declared on these several claims. The defendant pleaded <em>non assumpsit </em>and payment with leave, &amp;e. On the trial of the cause the plaintiff produced witnesses to prove the due-bill, note, and book account, and the principal contest in the case turned on a question raised by the defendant, <a id="p228" href="#p228" data-label="228" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*228</a>as to the genuineness of the $1000 note. The plaintiff gave the $1000 note in evidence after having given proof of its execution. Jane Neely, who had signed the note as subscribing witness, had been the subject of an inquisition <em>de lunático inquirendo, </em>and had been found a lunatic without lucid interval, about nine or ten months prior to the trial. The proceedings on that inquisition having been read in evidence, the plaintiff was permitted to prove her handwriting as though she had been dead or out of the state, and also the handwriting of G. Washington Neely, the maker of the note. After the testimony on the part of the plaintiff was closed, the defendant offered to prove that Jane Neely made declaration in relation to her signature to this note since the finding of the inquisition, but at a time when she enjoyed a lucid interval. The plaintiff’s counsel objected to the admission of the evidence. The <em>evidence </em>was overruled, hut defendant was permitted <em>to </em>call Jane Neely. The defendant then proceeded to examine other witnesses, but did not call Jane Neely. Before closing his evidence in the case he renewed his application to the coimt, and offered again to prove by Benjamin Millies, the same witness, the declarations of Jane Neely in relation to her signature as witness to the execution of the $1000 note; these declarations being made since the finding of the inquisition of lunacy, and at a time when it was alleged she enjoyed a lucid interval. The plaintiff’s attorney again objected to the admission of the testimony, but the objection was overruled, and the defendant was allowed to prove the declaration, after producing some testimony tending in the opinion of the court to establish the existence of a lucid interval. This declaration, according to the testimony, was made a few weeks before the trial, while Mrs. Neely was absent from her own house.</p>
