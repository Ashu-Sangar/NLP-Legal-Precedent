It would seem, therefore, that the wife is only barred of her <em>dower at common law, </em>if she accepts under the will. As to any part of the personal estate remaining undisposed of by the will, she would take her purpart or share under the intestate laws, not being barred by the statute, either in its letter or its spirit: In Leinaweaver <em>v. </em>Stoever, <em>1 W. &amp; Ser. </em>160, it was held that the acceptance by a widow of her share under the intestate laws did not bar her from recovering dower of land aliened by her husband in his lifetime. There is a pretty strong analogy between that case and the present. The former exhibiting the tendency of our courts to favor the claim of the widow to her full share under our statute <a id="p454" href="#p454" data-label="454" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*454</a>of distribution, if. she chose to claim it, irrespective of the claim of her dower at common law. This same tendency was strongly exemplified by a train of decisions anterior to the Act of 1794. It was held that equity would only interfere to bar the widow where the implication, that the testator intended that she should not have dower, and the devise or bequest was so strong and necessary that it could not be resisted, or where, if she took both, it would defeat the whole will: <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Dall.%20418" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Dall. 418">2 <em>Dall. </em>418</a>; <a href="/yeates/2/0387-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Yeates 387" data-case-ids="812608,812629" data-case-paths="/yeates/2/0387-01,/yeates/2/0387-02">2 <em>Yeates </em>387</a>; <em>Addison </em>351. And in Evans <em>v. </em>Webb, it was said by Yeates, Justice, the venerable father of Pennsylvania Law, that if she takes a larger estate under the will than her dower, it shall not be in bar thereof unless so expressed. The Act of 1794, section 1st, provides, “ that the share of the estate of the intestate in this act directed to be allotted to the widow, shall be in lieu and satisfaction of her dower at common law.” This act settled what had long been contested, but always decided in favor of the widow by the courts. Under this Act, when she gave up her testamentary right, she stood, as it regarded the devisee of the land, in the light of a purchaser for her share, and not as a mere volunteer. Her right to election was indisputable, under the Act of 1794; and it was ruled in <a href="/yeates/2/0302-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Yeates 302" data-case-ids="812737" data-case-paths="/yeates/2/0302-01">2 <em>Yeates </em>302</a>, that her election must be by plain and explicit acts, under a full knowledge of the circumstances of her husband, and of her own rights. Then came, the Act of 1833, which I have cited, and in which the words appended to “ dower,” to wit, at <em>common </em>law, in the Act of 1794, are dropped. Subsequently the law of 1848 was enacted, the 11th section of which is in substance as follows: “the Act of 1833 shall not deprive the widow, in case she elects not to take under the will of her husband, of her share of the personal estate of her said husband, but that the said widow may take her claim either of the bequest or devise, or her share of the personal estate under the intestate laws.” This section is plainly cumulative and in addition to the 11th section of the Act of 1833, and intended to explain it. It certainly could not have been intended to repeal it. The legislature seem to have thought, that by the word <em>dower </em>in that.section, dropping the addition of the words <em>at common law, </em>which were used in the Act of 1794, was meant the <em>widow’s share, </em>and that she was not confined to dower <em>at common law. </em>Hence the Act of 1848; and it is a matter of no consequence whether that Act was a declaratory Act, or an original law, because it was in full operation more than a year before testator’s death.</p>
