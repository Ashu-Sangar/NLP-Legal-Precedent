The rule as to negotiable paper does not exclude a subsequent endorser from testifying in support of the note, at the instance of the holder, who was a prior endorser; such prior endorser in taking up the note is not a volunteer. But where the note has been apparently long due, and the prior endorser apparently discharged for want of notice, <em>such prior endorser, </em>in lifting the note, would appear to be a volunteer; and therefore he could not use the subsequent endorser, who was the holder at the time, as a witness in a suit against the first endorser, to prove that the note was given in the year following the date of it, and not in the year stated on its face.</p>
