Boyer &amp; Zimmerman, made their promissory note for the payment, fifteen months after date, to the order of G. Gundrum, of $537.50, without defalcation, for value received, which note was in due form endorsed by the said G. Gundrum, and the amount of said note ordered to be paid to Lewis H. Giese and James H. Giese, then partners, and trading in the name of Giese <em>&amp; </em>Son. On the 12th day of January, 1850, the said Giese &amp; Son, having been unable to meet and pay all their debts as their payments were demanded, executed an assignment of all their <em>partnership </em>property, real, personal, and mixed, of whatsoever kind, or wheresoever found, including ‘all book accounts, bonds, bills, notes, evidences,’ &amp;c., to the said Jos. J. Speed, in trust for the benefit of their creditors <em>[Pro ut </em>said assignment as well as a previous assignment dated the 5th May, 1849, referred to in the one of the later date]. Among the property and assets of the said Giese &amp; Son, which came into the hands and possession of the said Joseph J. Speed, by virtue of the aforesaid assignment, was the aforesaid note of Boyer &amp; Zimmerman. To February Term, 1850, No. 40, an action was brought, on the said note, by the said J. J. Speed, as assignee of Giese &amp; Son, against said Boyer &amp; Zimmerman, and a judgment was rendered in favor of the plaintiff on the 22d May, 1850, for the sum of $550.91. A <em>ft. fa. </em>was issued on the judgment No. 22, of February Term, 1851, by virtue of which the sheriff made the debt, interest and costs of said judgment—the amount of the debt and interest is $574.98,—which sum the sheriff has ready, to be paid over to the persons entitled to the same, and is considered by the parties to this case the same as if he had paid the money into court. On the 9th day of July, 1850, William J. May and Reuben Klose, late partners trading under the firm of May &amp; Klose, issued a foreign attachment in the Court of Common Pleas of Union county, No. 29, of September Term, 1850, against Lewis H. Giese and James H. Giese, lately trading under the firm of Giese &amp; Son, with notice to William Boyer &amp; Jacob G. Zimmerman, garnishees. To this <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>attachment the sheriff made return that he had served the same on Boyer &amp; Zimmerman, on the 10th of July, 1850, by attaching <em>‘ </em>all debts, bonds, notes, judgments, and liabilities due by said William Boyer &amp; Jacob G. Zimmerman, particularly a certain judgment in the Common Pleas of Union County, No. 40, February Term, 1850, on which judgment was rendered against Giese &amp; Son, on the 27th of February, 1851, for the sum of $2220.’ It is also agreed that the said Giese &amp; Son resided in'the city of Baltimore, in the state of Maryland, at the time of executing both the assignments, and that the latter one <em>never was recorded in the county of Union, </em>in the state of Pennsylvania. That the parties to the promissory note aforesaid, all reside in the state of Pennsylvania, except Giese &amp; Son, and J. J. Speed. If from the foregoing facts the Court should be of opinion that the plaintiff is entitled to the money aforesaid, then judgment to be entered for the above sum of $574.98. But if they should be of opinion that the defendants are entitled to the same, then judgment for defendants. The costs of this case to be paid out of the funds.”</p>

R. </em>117; and in Lowry <em>v. </em>Hall, 2 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>131; to which it is sufficient to refer for them. It will there be seen, that an involuntary transfer of movable property abroad by process at home, does not divest the title in prejudice of creditors domiciled at the place of the actual <em>situs ; </em>but that a voluntary transfer by the act of the owner divests it everywhere. The legal <em>situs </em>follows the domicile of the owner, and the law of the actual <em>situs </em>protects the claims of domiciled creditors there only against transfer by operation of law. It is by a rule founded on this distinction, that letters of administration vest no title to property abroad; and that probate of a will at the place of the actual <em>situs, </em>enables the exe<a id="p95" href="#p95" data-label="95" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*95</a>cutor to recover it, the will being a testamentary assignment by the voluntary act of the testator. Granting, for the sake of argument, that the actual <em>situs </em>of the debt in question was in Pennsylvania, the voluntary assignment of it in Maryland, by the owners of it, vested it in the trustees there against their creditors here. The assignment was as operative to transfer the property in the first instance as it would have been had it been executed by a citizen of Pennsylvania. It is argued, however, that the contract of assignment is void for want of conformity to the laws of our own state. The legal presumption is, that it was intended to be performed at the place where it was made; and, as there is nothing to rebut it, the law of the contract is the law at the place of its origin. In Allshouse <em>v. </em>Ramsey, <a href="/whart/6/0331-01" class="citation" data-index="13" data-cite="6 Whart. 331" data-case-ids="1836942" data-case-paths="/whart/6/0331-01">6 <em>Whart. </em>331</a>, a promise made in Jersey to pay the debt of another, was held by this court to be void by the statute of frauds of that state, though the particular section was not in force in our own. It is not to be doubted, that this assignment was in its origin and purpose a Maryland contract. It was sealed there, and the trusts created by it were to be executed there. The <em>lex loci contractus </em>determines the validity of the contract; the <em>lex fori </em>controls the remedy. True, it was said in Lowry <em>v. </em>Hall, 2 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>132, that the law of the actual <em>situs </em>not only protects the ownership of movable property, but prescribes the mode of its transfer; but that was predicated of the distinction between transfer by act of the party and transfer by act of the law. In other respects, the law of the <em>situs </em>regulates the transfer of real property alone. There is nothing in the case stated, therefore, to bar a recovery.</p>
