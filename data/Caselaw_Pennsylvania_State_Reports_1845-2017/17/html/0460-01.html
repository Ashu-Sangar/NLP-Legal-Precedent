After the hearing, the three persons were severally required to give bail in the sum of $500, for their appearance at the next session of the Court of Quarter Sessions of the county, and William L. Harney, their employer, became bail for them. Before leaving the office, Harney paid Matchett for the party-wall referred to; after which Harney asked the said alderman Challes Gr. Evans for the bill of costs, which the alderman furnished, and Harney paid the amount of the same. After notice given, this suit was brought by Harney against Evans, the alderman, for two penalties of $50 each, making together $100. The question was, whether Harney had the right of action.</p>

Although the person who brought the suit’in this case, was not a party to the proceedings in which the fees were charged, and therefore would not have been bound to pay them, even if they had been legal, unless in pursuance of some promise to those who were liable, yet having paid them, he alone was injured. The other persons from whom they were not demanded, sustained no wrong, and a suit brought by them for taking illegal fees from Harney, would have had no chance of success. If this action was not sustainable, no other was. But the law must not be so construed as to allow the evasion of it in every case, where the costs are paid by a stranger to the record. The party who pays is always the party-injured, unless he pays as the mere agent or messenger of somebody else. And the presumption is, that he pays out of his own pocket, unless the contrary is proved.</p>
