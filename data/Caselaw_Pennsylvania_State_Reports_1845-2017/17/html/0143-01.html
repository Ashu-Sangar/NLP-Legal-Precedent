Under this writ against Daniel Helfrich, the sheriff levied upon and proceeded to sell this stock of store goods in the possession of Jacob S. Helfrich. Those goods were claimed by Jacob S.

You are to inquire into the circumstances attending the sale, and all the other circumstances given in evidence, and into the acts and declarations of Daniel and Jacob, as well before as after the sale, which, taken together, will enable you to arrive at a proper conclusion with regard to the character of that transaction. So far as creditors of Daniel Helfrich were concerned, in whom was the ownership of those goods at the time of the levy and sale, by the sheriff? If the sale by Daniel to Jacob was fraudulent, within the meaning of the statute of Elizabeth, then, so far as the creditors were concerned, the ownership of those goods would have remained in Daniel—if not, it would have been in Jacob.

      <em>“ </em>Fraud, you will bear in mind, is never to be presumed. It must be established by proof. That proof, however, need not be direct and positive ; to require this, would be opening the door to fraud. Its existence may be deduced from circumstances affording strong presumption; in far the greater proportion of cases it can only be reached in this way. Fraud is distinguished as being either actual, positive fraud; or legal, constructive fraud. The first seems to be, where there is an intention to commit a cheat or deceit upon another to his injury; the second seems to be, where the act is pronounced fraudulent in law, without being the result of fraudulent intention. To establish actual fraud, the intention to cheat or deceive must be proved directly or circumstantially; with regard to legal fraud, it is enough to prove the acts of which the law pronounces that kind of fraud to consist.

Jacob was clerk to his father for six or more years. There does not appear to have been any other clerk; certainly his opportunity of becoming acquainted with Daniel’s condition from this relation of son and clerk would seem to be very abundant. But you are not left to conjecture on this matter. One witness after another tells you that Jacob either knew of his father’s longstanding indebtedness to those witnesses, or testifies to circumstances from which such knowledge might be inferred. -Most of them testify to his having direct knowledge of his indebtedness. Taking all the evidence together, we think it would justify you in coming to the conclusion that Jacob was acquainted with his father Daniel Helfrich’s condition at the time he made the purchase of the store stock; though of that you are the judges.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b147-7" data-blocks='[["BL_147.6",147,[130,1397,1167,905]]]'>“ We will next inquire what that condition was. It is said that at the time of this sale, Daniel Helfrich was legally indebted beyond his means of payment; in short, that he was insolvent. How was this ? <em>This sale of the store goods by Daniel to Jacob would seem to have taken place in March, </em>1844, <em>on the thirteenth of that month. </em>From February to October, of that year, Daniel confessed judgments to the amount of $5466.68 to creditors, whose claims against him were generally of long standing; all of them pre-existing this sale, some of them for years; besides the debts for which judgment was confessed, there were others to Kutz, to Eckel, Spangler &amp; Baiguel, and to Gomfloh &amp; Co., amounting to a sum exceeding two thousand dollars, as I make it; the sum of his indebtedness was $7643; counsel have argued that it was higher than that. You will determine that, however, for yourselves; it is a fact for you. Now, his assets, according to my summary from my notes of evidence, consisted of his stock, valued at about $1200, land, &amp;c., which sold for $2466, and the <em>store stand </em>valued at $1500, making together about $5160. If these figures are correct, then did Daniel Helfrich’s indebtedness exceed his means of payment by about the sum of $2500; but whether that is correct or not, is for you to determine.</p>

The sale of this stock of goods to Jacob took place about the 13th March,'A. u. 1844, <em>about seven days after the deed from, Daniel to </em>Jacob, <em>conveying the store stand, had been executed. </em>You will remember how the purchase-money of that store stand was arranged between them to be paid; <em>a note for </em>$500 <em>at a short date, and ten notes of </em>$100 <em>each, payable respectively through ten successive years without interest. </em>In this way that purchase-money was to be paid. <em>Now, I have no hesitation in instructing you, that circumstanced as Daniel Selfrich was, if Jacob knew of his condition, that arrangement of the purchase-money of that store stand was a fraud in Icm. </em>If failing debtors are permitted to convey their estates away upon such terms as these, the statute of Elizabeth would have been passed in vain. No more effectual way of hindering creditors could be devised than this. A debtor could sell his property to his son upon payments of purchase-money about equal to the rent, and thus the creditors could be defrauded out of its entire value. Without any question of fraudulent intention, such a sale as that would be fraudulent in law. After parties have entered into such a transaction as that, where fraud in law has once attached to their act, they cannot cure it by subsequent arrangement. There is no purging a deed when it is once tainted with fraud.</p>

No witness was present at their sale, at least we have none here. All that we have is what Daniel and Jacob have said. The price seems to have been $1200, and it is agreed by all the witnesses that this was a fair price for it, as it stood at or about that time. There is no evidence that any money was paid to Daniel by Jacob, at the time of the sale. John Helfrich testifies that Jacob told him he was to pay the $1200 for the store stock to the old man’s (Daniel’s) creditors, as he could arrange it with them. From this witness’s testimony, it appears that the agreement for the sale of the store stock was made before the execution of the deed for the store stand. Jacob asked him if the store stock ought not to be put in the deed too, but the witness told him he thought it had nothing to do with the deed. The two transactions were then on the anvil at the same time. If they were in truth but one transaction, the sale of the store stock and of the store stand, then the fraud in law in that part of it relating to the store stand, would affect that part of it relating to the store goods.</p>

The levy in this case was sufficiently regular, as to the time when it was made, to justify a sale upon the execution after the return day. 3. We answer this point in the affirmative, as in fact we have already done. 4. It does not follow that whatever transaction took place in relation to the real estate had nothing to do with the transactions in relation to the sale of the store goods, unless they were shown to be simultaneous. Both the sale of the stand and of the goods were incomplete when Jacob wanted to have the goods put in the deed for the store stand. They were progressing toward their conclusion at the same time. 5. In such a case as that supposed in this point, it would not be necessary for the defendant to show fraud in fact, actual fraud, in order to vitiate the sale. If the plaintiff purchased with knowledge of his father’s insolvency, and there was a secret reservation in his favor ; or if the sale of the goods was combined with the sale of the stand, the legal fraud, in the reservation in the first, and in the mode of payment in the second case, would vitiate the sale. 6. We answer this point in the negative. 7. If there was legal fraud in <a id="p151" href="#p151" data-label="151" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*151</a>the sale of the real estate in the ca.se supposed here, it would vitiate the sale both of the real and of the personal estate. 8. Granting that he is presumed to have paid the $1200, and that was the full value of the goods, and that lie was liable to pay it to Daniel or to his creditors, still it would avail nothing if the transaction was tainted with legal fraud. 9. There is no evidence that the conduct of the persons suing out the execution, &amp;c., was oppressive and wanton, and we do not think this is a case for exemplary damages.</p>
