If you should be satisfied that at the time of the revival of the judgment the property in dispute belonged to Hollinshead, the plaintiff is entitled to recover. I say in 1842, the time the judgment was revived, because the plaintiff having omitted to revive his judgment, by issuing a <em>scire facias, </em>as prescribed by law, it had lost its lien, and, consequently, the lien only attaches from the time of its revival. This is the important part of time to which your attention will be particularly directed.

Ball assigned his interest in the mortgage to Edmund J. Hollinshead, who, on the 25th July, 1820, assigned the same to Jacob Ridgway. Proceedings were had on the mortgage, which resulted in the sale of the property to Jacob Ridgway, for the sum of $1090, who received in his own name a deed from the sheriff on the 19th February, 1822.</p>

The assignment of the Pedell mortgage, with the other assignments, were made the 20th July, 1820. At that time, as has been truly said by the defendant’s counsel, Hollinshead was not the owner of the property in dispute. The property belonged to Pedell, who mortgaged it to Ball, who assigned to Hollinshead, who assigned to Ridgway. From this the defendants contend, that as Ridgway became the purchaser of the property at the sheriff’s sale, he was the absolute owner of it, and, of course, had a right to dispose <a id="p278" href="#p278" data-label="278" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*278</a>of it as he pleased, either by gift or sale, at a greater or less sum, as he might see fit.</p>

These deeds are of the same date, viz., the 28th July, 1821.

The parties, it is true, exposed themselves to the risk of the property being levied or sold by a judgment creditor, either against the person holding the legal, or who is entitled to the equitable estate.

That the consideration mentioned in the deed, was nominal and fictitious, and not real. They infer fraud from all the circumstances in evidence, which they say, prove that intent. They further say, that fraud is manifest from her own declarations, as proved in the deposition of Anne McCarty, and the oath of Catherine Fitzgerald, who prove that Mrs. Whitaker, formerly Sarah E. Hollinshead, said in their presence, that the title was put in her name, merely to keep -it from her father’s creditors. That he had labored hard for the property, and intended to have the benefit of it as long as he lived. That it was shown he intended to keep it from his creditors.

Hollinshead was entitled to a life estate in the Cumberland land, as tenant by the curtesy, and nothing more; Sarah E. Hollinshead in right of her mother, who died in 1814, was tenant in fee. The life estate being conveyed to Ridgway, he stands in Hollinshead’s place; he is tenant for life, she is tenant in fee. Standing in this position, Ridgway being desirous to begin to dig sand from the soil, and to continue to dig it, it matters not much which, takes the advice of Mr. Ewing, at that time an eminent lawyer in the state of New Jersey. Afterwards, perhaps before he sells the sand, keeping, as I presume, an accurate account of the sales, amounting, as appears in evidence, to $18,316.47, which with interest added, increased to $23,697.89. I put it at this amount from the statement of counsel, without attempting to vouch for its accuracy. Of this you will judge. It appears that Hollinshead married his first wife, Miss Bower, Sarah’s mother, in 1806, who had a son in 1808, who died in his minority; that Sarah was born in 1816. There is no proof the sand was worked before the birth of the son, when the tenancy by the curtesy commenced.</p>

The effect would be this: the jury would have given, say 23,000, which the court would have been bound to treble, or, in other words, to give judgment for the sum of $41,750.

That there was then a valuable consideration moving from Sarah E. Hollinshead to Ridgway, or to her father, or both, no person can doubt. It is in truth the payment of a just and honest debt, owing by Ridgway to her, which, instead of being paid in cash, the parties have preferred to have paid in land. She had nothing to do with the manner Ridgway chose to settle his account with her father. He had no right, without her permission, to pay her father’s debts with her money. Sarah had an action against Ridgway, which she might have enforced either by bill in chancery, or by an action for money had and received for her use.

If she is, whatever may be the demands of Ridgway and her father, she is entitled to protection. She stands in a better, not in the same situation that they do, as she is a purchaser for a valuable consideration, and, of course, takes the property, notwithstanding there be a fraud in them. .</p>

There is nothing, however, in the circumstances of this case, that would justify a verdict for the plaintiffs on that ground alone. On this subject the counsel widely differ. It will be for you to estimate the difference, and to give it such weight as you may think it justly entitled to.</p>

      <em>“ </em>Fraud is not to be presumed on slight grounds. It must be proved, not by positive evidence, it is true, but by evidence which clearly indicates the dishonest and corrupt intent.

This is not binding on you, although it is considered as entitled to some weight, particularly in a doubtful case. It is also contended that the plaintiffs cannot recover, because Hollinshead took the benefit of the Act, and conveyed his property to trustees, for the benefit of his creditors. The objection would be fatal to the plaintiff’s recovery, were it not for the fact, that the conveyance was made the 12th April, 1822, and we hear of no proceedings since that time. After such a lapse of time, the law presumes a reconveyance of the assignee’s property, or that some arrangement has been made with the trustees, by which the property has been reinvested in the assignor. Under the circumstances, we think the assignment forms no obstacle in the way of the plaintiff’s recovery.</p>

In all investigations, physical and moral, which are guided by evidence or observation, the more carefully these facts and circumstances are collected and considered, the more certain are the conclusions. This is essentially what is, in short, called the rule of the <em>res gesta. </em>If we eliminate from the transaction any of the facts which tend to illustrate its character, we are guilty of the fallacy of non-observation, and endanger the accuracy of our induction.</p>

    <p id="b284-6" data-blocks='[["BL_284.4",284,[338,525,1155,256]]]'>The plaintiffs aver that the whole connection of Jacob Ridgway with the property in controversy is the transaction (the <em>res </em>gesta) which proves the fact of the trust, and that, in order to decide the question which they raise, we must inquire how Ridgway got the property, how he held it, and how he disposed of it; and this view of the case, as a question of evidence, is undoubtedly correct.</p>
    <p id="b284-7" data-blocks='[["BL_284.5",284,[337,782,1157,330]]]'>It was therefore proper to regard as relevant evidence the agreement of 25th July, 1820, for that is the link that connects Ridgway with the transaction. That instrument placed him in the position of trustee as to certain claims of Hollinshead, and one of these claims gave him the means of purchasing at sheriff’s sale the property in controversy and obtaining the conveyance from sheriff North, which must also be inspected as part of the transaction.</p>
    <p id="b284-8" data-blocks='[["BL_284.6",284,[335,1122,1155,332]]]'>Having seen how he obtained the property, we must next inquire how he held it. Here his account book is directly in point, and most emphatically relevant. It contains the whole account of his proceedings under the agreement of 25th July, 1820, and in relation to other property subsequently conveyed to him by Hollinshead, including many entries relating to the property in controversy. Those entries are his own admissions concerning the character of the transaction.</p>
    <p id="b284-9" data-blocks='[["BL_284.7",284,[332,1465,1158,637]]]'>Be it remarked that by that agreement Hollinshead had transferred to Ridgway, as collateral security, among other things, a mortgage on this property. Ridgwa.y pursued the mortgage to execution, and in October, 1821, bought it himself, and got the deed for it in February, 1822, for the consideration of $1090. Of course, if he bought it for himself, we should expect him to credit Hollinshead with that amount, as so much collected for him, and to charge him with the expenses of collection. But if he bought it in for Hollinshead, we should expect to find Hollinshead charged with the expenses of the suit and not credited with the proceeds of sale; and this last is exactly what we do find. This, then, is his own admission that he bought the lot with Hollinshead’s money and for his use. The same admission is often repeated by crediting Hollinshead with the rent and charging him with expenses of the property.</p>
    <p id="b284-10" data-blocks='[["BL_284.8",284,[333,2103,1154,299]],["BL_285.1",285,[178,393,1161,77]]]'>Besides the property contained in the agreement of July, 1820, we find that he obtained absolute deeds from Hollinshead for four other pieces of property on the 28th July, 1821, and yet there are many entries in the book showing that these too were held in trust for Hollinshead. This fact is also relevant on the subject of the trust, and, with the other facts and the proof that Hollinshead was largely in debt, tends to show that the agreement and <a id="p285" href="#p285" data-label="285" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*285</a>éonveyanees were made to defraud creditors, though Ridgway may not have known it.</p>
    <p id="b285-5" data-blocks='[["BL_285.4",285,[179,478,1160,172]]]'>In 1834, Ridgway conveyed the property to Sarah, daughter of Ilollinshead, and the next inquiry is, did she know that Ridgway held in trust for her father ? Anne McCartney testifies to her admissions of knowledge. Are such admissions competent evidence ?</p>
    <p id="b285-6" data-blocks='[["BL_285.5",285,[178,651,1159,205]]]'>We must here remark, that in 1838, Sarah conveyed this lot to her father to hold for her separate use, and that since that, she married Robert Whitaker. The admissions were made since her marriage. The question is, does her position as a married woman exclude her admissions in such a case as this ?</p>
    <p id="b285-7" data-blocks='[["BL_285.6",285,[178,865,1161,559]]]'>Where there is any probability that a wife acts under the constraint of her husband, or in such a way as to enure to his benefit, we should be very guarded about receiving her admissions against herself. But where there can be no such suspicion, and her admissions are most palpably against her own interest and directly affecting her separate estate, I know of no principle of policy that would exclude them. In the case of McKee <em>v. </em>Jones, 6 <em>Penna. St. Rep. </em>425, her admissions were received in just such a case as this; and it is impossible to see that the fact of the husband’s presence in that case was an element essential to their competency, as against herself. It cannot be doubted that in an equity suit to establish the trust, she would be compelled to answer: Langley <em>v. </em>Fisher, 5 <em>Beav. </em>477; Murphy <em>v. </em>Hubert, 16 <em>Penna. St. Rep. </em>50.</p>
    <p id="b285-8" data-blocks='[["BL_285.7",285,[179,1424,1161,687]]]'>Make these admissions as light as you will, they are not the only weights which the plaintiffs cast into the scale against the defendants. In Ridway’s account-book all the sand is credited to the father; yet, when the land received from the father is conveyed back to the daughter, she gets credit in the deeds for the sand, and the money consideration named in the deeds and secured by mortgage from her, is exactly the amount necessary to balancé the account between Ridgway and her father. Thus it appears that as soon as the father’s account is settled, the land of the father is conveyed to the daughter, and he is a witness to the deeds. It is hard to believe that this was done without the consent of the father, and her knowledge of his title. Under such circumstances, her agreement that her half-brother, the son of her father, should have half the property, is a most suspicious liberality. I say nothing about his management of the property during all the time that Ridway held the title.</p>
    <p id="b285-9" data-blocks='[["BL_285.8",285,[183,2110,1155,258]]]'>In one of the tracts of land, Ilollinshead had only a curtesy estate through his first wife, the mother of Sarah, and this was conveyed to Ridgway. It was here that the sand was got, the proceeds of which Ridgway credited to the father. The plaintiffs in error insist that the learned judge erred in not charging the jury that, for this waste, Sarah was entitled to treble damages.</p>
    <p id="b285-10" data-blocks='[["BL_285.9",285,[227,2367,1109,44]],["BL_286.1",286,[314,381,1163,429]]]'>It is alleged that the importance of this point appears thus:—• <a id="p286" href="#p286" data-label="286" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*286</a>The whole consideration named in all the conveyances of Ridgway to Sarah, is exactly $27,000, part of it being a money consideration sufficient to balance her father’s account with Ridgway, and the remainder, $23,697, being expressly said to be for the sand. On the other side it is alleged, that this is a totally insufficient consideration, and therefore further evidence of fraud. To meet this view of the case, the plaintiffs in error claim that Sarah was entitled to have the damage trebled, and to claim that much from Ridgway, and that that should be considered in estimating the real consideration paid by her for the land.</p>
    <p id="b286-6" data-blocks='[["BL_286.4",286,[313,809,1158,558]]]'>But it is entirely unnecessary to consider the point of law presented. It seems to be a forlorn hope, got up for a desperate emergency. One can hardly imagine a more ridiculous idea than that Sarah should make such a claim against the friend who had for years been digging out and patching together for her the broken fragments of her father’s fortune. Had she attempted to drive such a bargain, she would have found that the lines were in Mr. Ridgway’s hand. There is no evidence that she ever did make such a claim. By her own agreement, appearing in the consideration of the deeds, her claim was settled at $23,697, and she cannot now be allowed to show that she could possibly have made more of it, if she had been disposed to claim it. Surely there was no generosity in her not claiming it.</p>
    <p id="b286-7" data-blocks='[["BL_286.5",286,[311,1366,1156,342]]]'>E. J. Hollinshead made an assignment as an insolvent in 1822, and it is insisted that that is an outstanding title that bars this recovery. But this is not so. Where an insolvent conceals property from his creditors, and then procures it to be conveyed to one advised of the fraud, such grantee cannot set up the insolvent assignment against a creditor who has pursued the land and bought it at sheriff’s sale. If there be other creditors, they may be heard on proper terms.</p>
