A gift for a particular purpose implies that no greater estate is given than is necessary for the purpose. Thus a devise in fee, if intended only for payment of debts becomes a base fee ceasing on payment of debts: 1 <em>Bla. </em>645. So of a grant to a corporation: 6 <em>Ser. $ R. </em>234; and similar instances in <em>Vin. Ab. Esch. </em>A. 3, <em>n. </em>C. 8; <em>Cro. Eliz. </em>669; <em>Vin. Ab. Estate </em>I. 7, 7; T. 5, 2 ; <em>Estate b. a. </em>9; <em>Escheat F. </em>2. Reservation for a dwelling; a sale by the beneficiary destroys his estate: 9 <em>Barr </em>52. Eor the use and service of a mill is a base fee: 5 <em>Ib. </em>126. Such would have been the rule in England but from the disregard of the doctrine of resulting uses in cases of charities: <em>Amh. </em>190; 2 <em>J. &amp; Walk. </em>307. The present is clearly a resulting use: 1 <em>V. &amp; B. </em>272. In this country the same construction is given to instruments creating charities as other estates: <a href="/citations/?q=10%20Pick.%20185" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Pick. 185">10 <em>Pick. </em>185</a>; 11 <em>Ib. </em>495; <a href="/citations/?q=16%20Mass.%20496" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="16 Mass. 496">16 <em>Mass. </em>496</a>. To say the testator did not intend the property to be continued in the use for which it was given, would be dangerous doctrine to charitable uses. The legal intent is clear if we suppose a contest in the meeting as to the continuance or diversion from the trust, referred to this court. That the beneficiaries may abandon such a charity cannot be doubted. Eor the persons entitled are those only who can claim lawfully through this organization. Eor all purposes the individuals as beneficiaries are represented by the monthly meeting. If the court would carry on the trust at the instance of individuals against the will of the meeting- a. <a id="p99" href="#p99" data-label="99" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*99</a>is inevitable, and the trust violated. It is conceded there must be an acceptance to give an estate, and that can only be on the very conditions imposed: 3 <em>Meriv. </em>353; 1 W. &amp; <em>Ser. </em>9; <em>Cas. T. F. </em>222 ; <a href="/nc/16/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="1 Dev. Eq. 276" data-case-ids="11274925" data-case-paths="/nc/16/0276-01">1 <em>Dev. Eq. </em>276</a>. The right to reject after acceptance must exist in the same parties unless there be a contract created by the acceptance capable of being enforced by the court. And being thus rejected for the uses for which given, the estate commensurate with the uses fails: <a href="/mass/22/0528-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="5 Pick. 528" data-case-ids="2033111,2033240" data-case-paths="/mass/22/0528-01,/mass/22/0528-02">5 <em>Pick. </em>528</a>; <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Metc.%20238" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 Metc. 238">8 <em>Metc. </em>238</a> ; <a href="/nc/16/0276-01" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="1 Dev.

Wright <em>v. </em>Linn, 9 <em>Barr, </em>which overruled Kirk <em>v. </em>King, is a proof of our position. The rejection there was by trustees not. competent to bind the beneficiaries. The fact of a determination no longer to use the building as a place of worship is not denied; and as the court cannot carry on the charity against the will of the society, the estate has ceased, and that of the grantor revives.</p>
