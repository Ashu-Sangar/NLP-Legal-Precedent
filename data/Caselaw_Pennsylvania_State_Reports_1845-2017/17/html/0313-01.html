But the mere fact of one of the creditors upon a general meeting proposing and advocating the propriety of accepting particular terms of composition does not amount to a binding agreement.on his part, if afterwards any two or more of the creditors, short of the whole body, choose on their own account to agree to the terms proposed, and sign the agreement. Here some of the creditors refused to sign, and then the plaintiff refused, as the agreement could not be general, and carried out according to his proposition. We think no principle of law interdicted them from doing so, and that it did not produce a release or forfeiture of their debt.
