The widow refused to take under the will. Held, that as the said sum of three thousand dollars was to be invested for the use of John only on the marriage or decease of the widow, that John was not entitled to have that amount invested for his use on the refusal of the widow to take under the will; but it was directed that the balance in the hands of the administrator, which was less than $3000, be invested, and allowed to accumulate until the marriage or decease of the widow, when the sum of $3000 may be required to be invested for the benefit of John if living, and if not, then to be paid to his sons as directed by the will.</p>

On 8th July, 1850, the administrator with the will annexed filed his account, showing a balance in his hands of $22,929.21. An auditor was appointed to make distribution of the balance. The part of his report to which exception was taken was, <em>inter </em>alia, as follows:—</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b20-11" data-blocks='[["BL_20.9",20,[338,2083,1160,303]],["BL_21.1",21,[173,408,1166,1252]]]'>“ It remains to consider what disposition is to be made of the $3000 directed to be put to interest for the benefit of testator’s widow during her widowhood, she having refused to take anything under the will. In relation to the real estate devised to her during her widowhood, it is provided thus:—‘ Item: At the marriage or decease of my widow, I give and devise the house and lot to my son David during life,’ &amp;c.; and then follows this direction: <a id="p21" href="#p21" data-label="21" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*21</a>—‘And as to the $3000 put to interest for my widow as aforesaid, I direct the same to be put at interest by my executor for my son John, during his life,’ &amp;c., with remainder over. It is contended for John that the use of the $3000 vested in him at th'e election of the widow not to take under the will, the same as if she had married or died—the intention of the testator being that it should go to John as soon as the estate of the mother therein terminated. If the circumstance of the mother’s refusing to take under the will, had rendered the happening of the contingencies upon which John’s title was to accrue anything the less probable, such a construction might be favored. For the words ‘ at the marriage or decease of my widow,’ at the commencement of the clause in relation to the real estate, are to be referred also to the $3000, although they are not expressly repeated. And inasmuch as the election of the widow has evidently reduced the amount which will be coming to the residuary legatees, and thereby interfered with the calculations of the testator in that behalf, without affecting the specific sums bequeathed to John and others, the auditor thinks that John should wait until the literal happening of the contingency upon which he was to take—the interest of the $3000, in the mean time, to be applied under the residuary clause, to restore in some measure that equilibrium amongst the objects of the testator’s bounty, which the widow’s election unexpectedly to him has disturbed. The auditor thinks that the widow’s election not to take under the will, being a contingency not contemplated by the testator, is not specifically provided for, and that the fund remains undisposed of until one or the other of the contingencies named shall happen, except under the residuary clause, which requires it to be put at interest for five years before distribution.”</p>

However, the auditor does not intend to decide questions which have not yet arisen. He therefore merely directs the administrator to invest this balance, allowing the interest to accumulate, until subsequent events determine what further disposition is to be made of it. The balance to be thus invested is the sum of $2706.31.”</p>

The widow’s refusal, where it does not directly, ought not to be construed indirectly to disturb other provisions. In this distribution, the legacies have all been paid in full and with interest, except this one of $3000, and interest enough had accrued on it at the time of the Court’s decree to have made it whole: King <em>v. </em>King, 1 W. &amp; <em>Ser. </em>205.</p>

By doing so she receives a much larger amount than what was devised her, and withdraws funds that were intended by the testator for his children. By the will of John Knepley, three thousand dollars were to be put to interest by his executor, and the interest paid annually to his widow during her widowhood ; and it was after provided, that at the marriage or death of his widow, the same three thousand dollars were to be put to interest by his executor for his son John during his lifetime, and at his decease the principal to be paid to his sons Charles and Henry Knepley, and if one of his sons should die before his father, the survivor to take the whole.

The balance of the personal estate remaining after the appropriation to legacies then payable, was $2706.31, which John claims to be invested immediately for his use, inasmuch as the widow declined to receive the same to be invested for her use. By the terms of the will, this sum of $3000, to be put to interest first for the widow, was only to be invested for the use of John in the manner provided on the death or marriage of the widow; and though the widow has refused to take it, and by her claim has disturbed the distribution and displaced the funds from the administration intended by the will, yet it is not for the law to supply this by a disposition not. expressed in the will, so as to give John the benefit of an investment of the balance remaining, at a time before the contingencies named, viz. the death or marriage of the Vidow. To conform to the will as far as practicable, it will be sufficient to provide for the investment for John when the contingencies may occur that authorize it; and that in the mean time it is proper, and the duty of the administrator, to invest the balance in his hands at interest, and allow it to accumulate until the marriage or decease of the widow, when of the same, $3000 may be required to be invested for the benefit of John if living, and if not, to be paid to his sons Charles and Henry in the manner directed by the will.</p>
