It is however with the limitation that its application is restricted to the case of negotiable paper, actually negotiated and put in circulation before its maturity; and still in the hands of an innocent holder, without notice of any original defect. The rule with such limitations has been sustained in the Supreme Court of the United States, in cases reported in <a href="/us/31/0051-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="6 Pet. 51" data-case-ids="1439669" data-case-paths="/us/31/0051-01">6 <em>Peters </em>51</a>-57; <a href="/us/33/0012-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="8 Pet. 12" data-case-ids="1438428" data-case-paths="/us/33/0012-01">8 <em>Peters </em>12</a>; <a href="/us/36/0086-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="11 Pet. 86" data-case-ids="3344340" data-case-paths="/us/36/0086-01">11 <em>Peters </em>86</a>, 94, 95; <a href="/citations/?q=12%20Pet.%20149" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="12 Pet. 149">12 <em>Peters </em>149</a>.</p>

This is manifested by the limitations adopted. It is confined to-instruments strictly negotiable, which have been actually negotiated in the usual course of business: Hepburn <em>v. </em>Cassel, 6 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>115; Baird <em>v. </em>Cochran, 4 <em>Ser. &amp; R. </em>397. A party to paper actually negotiated, though inadmissible to impeach it, may prove subsequent matters as payment or discharge: Appleton <em>v. </em>Donald<a id="p83" href="#p83" data-label="83" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*83</a>son, 3 <em>Barr </em>385; Guilford <em>v. </em>Skinner, 9 <em>Barr </em>334; Maynard <em>v. </em>Nekervis, <em>Ib. </em>81.</p>

The court below, in rejecting the deposition for the limited purpose, may have been misled by the opinion given by this court in this case on the former occasion. It is to be remarked, that there the witness was clearly incompetent by reason of interest; and what was said by the learned judge in relation to his exclusion. from testifying, by reason of having been the <em>bona fide </em>owner of the draft, which he disposed of, was without the full consideration that it would have received, had the admission of the testimony depended on the rule of policy, instead of the more decisive objection of interest. '</p>
    <p id="b83-6" data-blocks='[["BL_83.5",83,[147,1054,1168,521]]]'>In our opinion, policy does not require the extension of this rule to exclude from testifying any other than parties to negotiable paper whose names are on the paper, provided they are not disqualified by interest in the event of the suit, or by reason of legal infamy. In the case of Walton <em>v. </em>Shelly it was said by Lord Mansfield, “ That the old cases upon the competency of witnesses have gone upon very subtle grounds. But of late years, the courts have endeavored as far as possible, consistent with those authorities, to let the objection go to the credit, rather than to the competency of the witness.” The like sentiments were expressed by Lord Hardwicks in the case of King <em>v. </em>Bray, and cited with approbation by Lord Kenyon in Bent <em>v. </em>Baker, 3 <em>T.

The objection that a man should not be allowed to impeach and invalidate what before by his declarations and acts he had attested or held out to the world to be valid and true, goes only to his credibility with the jury: 1 <em>Phil. Ev. </em>39,40; <em>Greenl. Ev. </em>sect. 384. On this ground parties to instruments other than negotiable paper, as well as subscribing witnesses, if not under some other disability, are admissible witnesses to impeach the original validity of such instruments: Baring <em>v. </em>Shippen, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Binn.%20165" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="2 Binn. 165">2 <em>Bin. </em>165</a>; Balliott’s Lessee <em>v. </em>Bowman, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Binn.%20162" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="2 Binn. 162">2 <em>Bin. </em>162</a>, note; Title <em>v. </em>Grevett, 2 <em>Raymond </em>1008; Lowe <em>v. </em>Jolliffe, 1 <em>W.

This restriction of the rule is supported by the decision of this court in Guilford <em>v. </em>Skinner, 9 <em>Barr </em>334, in which it was ruled that the holder of a promissory note payable to bearer, who had transferred it without endorsement, was a competent witness for the drawer.

Had Barber’s deposition been admitted in evidence, it would have been pertinent to contradict or qualify the testimony of Barber by the testimony of Chandler.

In this, it is the opinion of this court, there was misdirection and error by the court in not submitting to the jury for their consideration the facts as testified to by John Snyder and William Glover, as to the character of the draft and the liability and purpose for which the plaintiff held the same; and in withdrawing entirely from the jury the facts in the direction given to find a verdict for the plaintiff.</p>
