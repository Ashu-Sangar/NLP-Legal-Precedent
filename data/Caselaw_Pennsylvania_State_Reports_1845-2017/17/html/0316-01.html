      <a id="p317" href="#p317" data-label="317" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*317</a>This was an action by James A. McCrea <em>v. </em>William W. Longstreth, to recover back part of a sum of <em>money </em>paid for a large quantity of hay and other produce of a farm, and also other articles of property, which had been sold by McCrea to Longstreth. Longstreth had lived on a farm which he subsequently sold to McCrea; and Longstreth also sold to McCrea grain and hay which had been harvested, and other hay and grain then growing. The amount of the grain and hay not being known at the time of the sale, it was <em>estimated, </em>and it was stated in the receipt for the consideration-money, that the quantities were not guarantied to be accurate, but were sold for that sum, be the quantities more or less. The amount of the estimate was $2080, but the property was sold for $1800. In the first count of the declaration, a contract was alleged by which Longstreth, in consideration of <em>eighteen hundred dollars </em>paid to him by McCrea, agreed to deliver to plaintiff various kinds of property, viz., 10Ó tons of hay, 1200 bushels of corn, 150 bushels of rye, 150 bushels of wheat, and 700 bushels of oats, by means whereof he became bound to deliver the same, but has not delivered, although requested, to wit, 34 tons of hay, &amp;c., setting forth the deficiencies.</p>

We infer from the circumstances, and from what we see in the paper-book, that the corn was in the ear, the grain in the sheaf, unthrashed, and of course unmeasured, and that the hay had not been weighed. We also infer that the vendee, who had been “ all over the farm,” had seen the articles of personal property before he purchased them. At the time of the purchase, an estimate was made of the quantity of each article, and the price was carried out opposite the statement of quantity. The items were added together, and the aggregate was placed at the foot of the column, amounting to the sum of $2080. At the foot of this estimate, there was a receipt for the sum of “ $1800, in full for the personal property enumerated above, on the farm lately sold.” In the body of this receipt it was stated that the estimated quantities are not guarantied to be accurate, but the articles are sold for the sum named, <em>“ </em>be the quantities more or less than estimated.”</p>

Nor was there any evidence that the farm could not .grow the quantities enumerated as on the premises. On the contrary, we infer from the transaction that the quantities were unknown to either party, and that the articles were open to the inspection of both, each having equal advantages in making the estimate, and neither having the power, by any means whatever, to arrive at anything like certainty with regard to the quantity of the wheat, rye, and oats, as measurement of grain in the straw is impossible. The hay, it is true, might have been weighed, and the corn might have been measured in the ear, and if there had been an offer to prove that the quantity had been thus ascertained, by the defendant, <em>before he made his estimate, </em>thus showing that he, <em>knowingly, </em>made a false representation in regard to it, the evidence would, without doubt, have been admitted, and would have been material testimony for the consideration of the jury on the question of fraud. But no such evidence was offered. And it is scarcely necessary to say that an error in an estimate of the quantity of hay in the barn or stack, grain unthrashed, and corn in the ear, where each party had equal means of knowledge, and neither relied upon the estimate of the other, ought not to be regarded as evidence of <em>fraud.</em>

The purchase-money has been paid and the property has been delivered by the vendor, and accepted and retained by the vendee. The contract has been completely executed, and the vendee is now asking to recover back a portion of the purchase-money, upon the ground of a mutual mistake in the estimate of the quantities. And he asks this although the evidence given by 'himself shows that he <a id="p321" href="#p321" data-label="321" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*321</a>did not contract upon the basis of the defendant’s estimate, but upon one of his own more favorable to his interest; and shows further that it was part of the express agreement of the parties that “the quantities were not guarantied to be accurate,” and that the articles were finally sold for the sum of $1800 (being less than the sum claimed by the vendor in his estimate), “ <em>be the quantities more, or less than estimated.”</em>

After a man conveys his farm, and is about to remove from the premises, perhaps to a place so distant as to render it exceedingly inconvenient to return in order to look after his crops, it is in most cases conducive to his interest to sell them. And it is generally greatly to the advantage of the purchaser of the farm to become the owner of the crops. Under such circumstances, where measurement is impossible, and weighing too expensive to be thought of, the parties ought certainly to be permitted to make their bargains upon an estimate of quantity. And having done so, with the articles before them, each exercising his judgment with equal means for forming an opinion, and both agreeing that an error in the' estimate shall not be made the foundation of an action, the courts of justice have no right to disturb their arrangements in violation of their contract. After the whole contract has been fully executed by the parties, the expression adopted by Yeates, J., in Steinhauer <em>v. </em>Witman, 1 <em>Ser. </em>&amp; <em>R. </em>448, is peculiarly applicable, “ the funeral has passed by; the dead cannot be resuscitated.”</p>
