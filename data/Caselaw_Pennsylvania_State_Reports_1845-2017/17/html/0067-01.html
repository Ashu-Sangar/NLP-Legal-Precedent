This firm did business until the close of the year 1843. The firm of Reuben Eagely &amp; Company, composed of Reuben Eagely and William Eagely, was formed in 1844. The evidence seems greatly to preponderate in showing that the promise declared on was made in 1843, by the firm of Eagely, Kase &amp; Co., and before the firm of Eagely &amp; Co. was instituted.</p>
    <p id="b70-9" data-blocks='[["BL_70.11",70,[345,920,1149,292]]]'>The court instructed the jury, “that if the firm of Eagely, Kase &amp; Co. did, in the year 1843, make the promise declared on, it would be binding on the firm, and all the members thereof who are sued would be liable in the present action.” The court further instructed the jury, that the only way in which the defendants could take advantage of the non-joinder of Kase, was by plea in abatement.</p>
    <p id="b70-10" data-blocks='[["BL_70.12",70,[336,1221,1157,814]]]'>This is not the case of a single firm, trading and doing business ostensibly in another name than that in which they had agreed to •conduct their business. In that case, the name in which they conducted their business, ostensibly, and which was known to the public as their business name, would bind all the members of the firm, and all and each of them would be answerable for the contracts so made. But two or three members of a firm may compose a firm under a different name, known to the public, and they as a firm would be liable only for their own contracts. The firm of Reuben Eagely &amp; Co. was of this description, and as a firm they would not be answerable for the contracts of the firm of Eagely, Kase &amp; Co. To hold or rule that, would be to confound the principles of contract, the rules of pleading, and the mode of settling and proof of partnership accounts. If the defendants had been sued as individuals the contract would have to be proved as laid, and if they 'had been sued as the firm of Eagely, Kase &amp; Co., the contract would have to be proved as laid; but in that case, if they wished to take advantage of the non-joinder of one member of the firm, they would have to plead in abatement.</p>

It would be not merely a confusion of form, but might work a confusion of substance and justice. It is true that each member of a firm is responsible for all its engagements ; that Reuben Fagely and William Fagely are answerable for the contracts of the firm of' Fagely, Kase &amp; Co.; but then they must be pursued in a proper way, so as not to breed confusion and conflict among the creditors of both firms. They cannot be sued as the firm of Reuben • Fagely and William Fagely, partners trading under the firm of Reuben Fagely &amp; Co.
