Keen, in October, 1835, became surety to the sheriff of this county for one of his deputies, David Scattergood, in the sum of $6000. To secure himself against the loss which subsequently ensued, Mr., Keen endeavored to obtain a bond of indemnity to himself, to be executed by six obligors, among whom were Peter A. Keyser, who signed the bond, and Jacob Culp, who did not. Five, including Keyser, executed the bond—Jacob Culp’s name being inserted twice in the body of the paper, and a seal opposite to the place where his signature should have been. Keyser denied his liability on this bond, on account of the failure of Keen .to procure the signature of Jacob Culp, who never was spoken to on the subject, and who said he never heard of it till after the loss occurred.</p>
