An agreement to convey a title to be acquired and paid for thereafter is not a trust; nor are any declarations made by the person intending to purchase, evidence of a trust; nor will the payment of money by one man after a purchase has been completed by another, raise a trust in favor of the person by whom the money was furnished.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b219-7" data-blocks='[["BL_219.6",219,[149,785,1154,513]]]'>Answer.—It is true; an agreement to convey a title, to be acquired and paid for thereafter, is not a trust. And as a naked proposition, <em>“ </em>declarations made by the person intending to purchase,” may not be evidence of a trust; but as applied to this case, it will depend upon the circumstances. If the jury are satisfied Isaac Lloyd declared he intended to purchase this property for his father, and afterwards received from him the money to pay for it, consistent with such declarations, and then, in violation of the terms upon which he received the money, had the deed made to himself, such declarations are evidence. It is for the plaintiff to satisfy the jury of this. If the money was received as a gift, or a loan, such declarations would not be evidence.</p>

It resulted from the facts that the money which paid for the land belonged to the father, who was aged and infirm; that the son acted as his agent; that he declared both before and after the deed from the vendor to him that it was his father’s property. That he stood by and heard his father call it his own property, and declare that. he would make his son a title for a part of it. That the vendor, who was called by the son as a witness to show that all the negotiation for the sale was with the son, declared often that he thought at the time the deed was made that it was wrong; he thought the deed ought to be made to the man whose money paid for the property. All these facts, if believed by the jury, together with many attending circumstances, such as the embarrassments of the son, and his need for money before that time, and the circumstance of the father having sold his plantation for $3000, shortly before the purchase, established a resulting trust in the father, and the evidence covered by the two bills of exceptions was properly admitted.
