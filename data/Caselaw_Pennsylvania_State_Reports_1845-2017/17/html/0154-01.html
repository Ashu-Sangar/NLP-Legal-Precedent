The husband loaned the money away, and his agent subsequently collected it and paid it to the husband who receipted for it.

She was then tenant of one McAdams. By a marriage contract, in which her brothers, W. H. and E. S. Sheetz, were trustees,' her separate property was secured to her. In April, 1842, Hallman and wife left the premises. McAdams <a id="p155" href="#p155" data-label="155" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*155</a>claimed $250 rent. Mrs. Hallman gave her husband $250 of her own funds to pay the rent. Hallman agreed with her, to resist the payment, to keep the $250 for her use, to be repaid her if he should gain the suit, and to pay whatever more McAdams might recover out of his own funds. McAdams seized their goods, after they had been removed from the premises. Hallman issued a replevin, gave bond, and the goods were returned to him. The replevin was tried, and the jury, under direction of the court, refused to find either for plaintiff or defendant. McAdams then sued Hallman and wife for the $250 rent, which suit is still pending. In October, 1842, Hallman offered to loan the $250 to <em>W. </em>H. and F. S. Sheets, telling them it was his wife’s money, and the conditions on which he held it. They agreed to take it, and gave their note for the amount, payable with interest, on demand, to Henry Hallman, his heirs, executors, administrators, or assigns. December 31, 1845, Hallman being sick, gave Hobensack a power of attorney to collect his outstanding moneys, and placed in his hands the note against the Messrs. Sheetz. Hobensack called on them to pay it. They said Hallman had told them it was his wife’s money, but as the note was payable to him on demand, they must pay it if insisted on. They said also it would be inconvenient then to raise the money. Hobensack told them it must be settled, but that he would, to accommodate them, advance the money for them, and take their note to himself at twelve months. This was done, and the note was delivered up to Mr. Sheetz, and destroyed. Testimony was given, that on the next day Hobensack paid Hall-man the amount of principal and interest received from Messrs. Sheetz, in the presence of two witnesses, and took his receipt, which was attested by the witnesses. The money was put into Hallman’s desk, which was locked, and the key handed to Hallman. Hobensack and the witnesses went away together. Not long after this Hallman died, and his widow brought this suit against <em>Sobensach, </em>to recover of <em>Mm </em>the $250 and interest. The defendant, on the trial, objected to the admission of any testimony, on the ground that the <em>ncirr. </em>and bill of particulars set forth no cause of action against him. That there was no privity between him and the plaintiff, and that a recovery by plaintiff in this suit would be no bar to an action against him for the same money by the administrator of Hallman. That the plaintiff must look to <em>Sail-man’s estate </em>for the money, and not to <em>Mm.</em>

On the 2d day of April, 1842, or thereabouts, Ann Hallman, the plaintiff, gave to the said Henry Hallman $250, with directions to him to pay over the money to the said Robt. McAdams, and settle the said suit. Henry Hallman took and received the money, but declared that he would not apply it in the way the said Ann directed as aforesaid, but that he would hold and retain it for her, and would repay and refund it to her whenever called upon or required so to do. The said Henry Hallman afterwards, to wit, on or about the 26th day of May, 1847, died, without having repaid or refunded the said sum of money .to the said plaintiff. The said Henry, in his lifetime, loaned the said sum of money to William H. and Francis S. -Sheetz, and took their note under seal for the same. This note came into the possession of the defendant, as the agent or attorney in fact, for the said Henry Hallman; and after the decease of the said Henry, the defendant claimed the right to collect the said note, and to receive the amount from the said William II. and Francis S. Sheetz; and he did collect the said note, and receive payment for the same from the said William <a id="p157" href="#p157" data-label="157" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*157</a>H. and Francis S.

    <p id="b157-18" data-blocks='[["BL_157.20",157,[207,1985,1160,298]]]'>1. The plaintiff below had authorized Hallman, her husband, to have the money until the contest with McAdams should be ended. That contest was not ended at the date of the receipt. The defendant, in paying the money to Hallman, did but place it where the plaintiff, by the express terms of her contract, authorized it to be. Under these circumstances his receipt was hers, and she was as much bound by it as if she had signed it herself.</p>

All of it, however, tended to establish the very facts set out in the declaration. Where the facts averred in the <em>narr. </em>would not, if admitted, entitle the plaintiff to judgment, the defendant should demur. If he denies the truth of the allegations, he calls for the evidence, and must not object to it when it comes. The defendant in this case made an issue in fact, and yet complains that it was not determined like an issue in law.</p>
