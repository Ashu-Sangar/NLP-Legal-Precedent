It was separated from the land in dispute by a fence. In this fence was a gate, which opened on to the disputed ground, which was part of a meadow. The meadow was pastured by the occupants of the testator’s farm. While Ileartley occupied Reuben’s property, he used to go through this gate and dry his clothes in the meadow, and get water from the mill-race on the side of the meadow. He .had also, by the consent of Reuben (not the testator), put a pig<a id="p194" href="#p194" data-label="194" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*194</a>pen and chicken-coop there, and a small erection a few feet from the fence.</p>

He also continued to use the meadow as formerly. In July, 1847, Heartley quitted possession of the adjoining house and lot, and McMullin entered as plaintiff’s tenant, and used ■the meadow as it had been used by Reuben Myers’s tenants. His testimony, on this point, was, “ I <em>suppose </em>I rented the whole property.” He was the only witness to prove the parol agreement. Whether he had a lease of the premises in question was disputed. Two or three months after his entry, the defendant’s testator chained up the gate; McMullin opened it, and again used the land, and was again excluded by Jacob Myers, who had a wall erected without a gate in it. <em>Jacob Myers died in </em>January, 1849.

The first question is, has she proved such contract as entitles her to a specific execution, if nothing else in the case prevents her ? Eor this the jury must look to the testimony and determine the facts. It would seem that, in 1846, she agreed with Reuben Myers for a certain property, in writing, dated 18th of June of that year, in which she was to pay, on failure to comply, a certain sum as forfeit-money. Reuben called on her for the purchase-money some time in 1847, when she told him she needed more ground adjoining, to which he assented; and as his father Jacob Myers had willed that ground to him in an instrument then executed, though Jacob was still alive, he would see him about it, and let her know in a day or two. After that Jacob said she should have such ground, being this in dispute, and Reuben should make her a deed for it <em>after his decease ; </em>she then <a id="p195" href="#p195" data-label="195" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*195</a>to pay $50 as the price; and, in the mean time, she to ha,ve possession and pay $3 per year, as interest. Witness says, that Jacob told her to take possession and use the property as her own by paying the $3 per year, and that Reuben pointed out its extent on the spot or ground; and that soon after she took a deed from Reuben, and built on the property contained in it; and that after this arrangement was made between her, Reuben, and Jacob, the matter of the forfeit was dropped, and she took the property. Then there is evidence that after Jacob’s death she tendered to Reuben, as one of his executors, the $50, which was refused, and that afterwards, and after this suit was brought, the executors sold the patch in dispute to another. She has also paid what she says is $50 into court, to be taken by defendants if the verdict should be in her favor. There is also evidence that said arrangement was made in January or February, 1847, and Heartley says he had rented the house of Reuben in 1843, and used the ground in question until 1847, as his tenant, when he rented from plaintiff and used it as before; a few months after which he left, and McMullin moved in, and still continues. McMullin says he rented from her the patch in dispute, it having been occupied by Heartley before, who left it about July 1847 ; that he used the patch for certain purposes a short time, when Jacob shut the gate; that he after-wards used it again, when he was again shut out; since which he has not used it at all. There is evidence that Jacob built a high wall to keep her or her tenants out; that in 1848, she sent for Altemus, among other things, to cut off her piazza, and make up the fence. He cut off eighteen inches of the corner towards these fifty feet, and set up the fence along stakes pointed out by her and Jacob Myers; that there was no gate put in the fence, and the parties appeared satisfied. This was 24th August of that year. The stone fence has been put up since, and no gate in it. There is also evidence of a submission and award between her and Jacob, one dated 15th December, 1847, and the other 21st February, 1848.” He referred to the jury the question whether the contract alleged on the part of plaintiff, was proved, and if so, whether there was such part performance before suit brought as entitled her to a specific execution of it; as to what constituted part performance, reference was made to the case of Pugh <em>v. </em>Good, 3 <em>W. &amp; Ser. </em>56; that possession must be taken in pursuance of the contract.</p>

This Act of 1834 gives an <em>additional remedy </em>in the Orphans’ Court, and provides a distinct system from that provided in the Acts of 1792 and 1818: Chess’s Appeal,- 4 <em>Barr </em>54. The Act of 1818, which the plaintiff confesses preserved the common law remedy—though subject to a penalty, is not repealed by it, nor is the remedy in the Court of Common Pleas therein provided, excluded; for the legislature have since recognised and extended that remedy. The Act of April 9, 1849, s. 2, extends and perfects the remedy provided by Act of 1834 in the Orphans’ Court, to cases where the purchaser is one of the executors or administrators, enabling the co-executor or administrator to make the deed, or if he is the only executor or administrator, enabling the sheriff to make the deed.
