This was done in pursuance of the final agreement of the parties, and the dispute which previously existed between them furnishes no ground of defence to the insurance companies, even if it be conceded that Martel violated a promise to deliver the goods, without payment. It is sufficient for the purposes of this attachment that the goods were never in fact delivered to the vendee, and that they were retained in the possession of” the vendor, by consent of both parties, to secure the payment of the purchase-money. Such a possession is good as between the parties; and, in favor of the creditors of the vendor, the goods might be treated as the absolute property of the latter.
