    <p class="summary" id="b60-13" data-blocks='[["BL_60.10",60,[313,1754,1162,470]]]'>The case came before the Court on an issue directed by the Register’s Court to try the validity of a certain written paper purporting to be the last will and testament of Jasper Loomis, deceased. In the issue Sarah Loomis and Samuel A. Loomis were plaintiffs, and Thomas E. Kellogg and Alma Kellogg his wife, defendants. In the will of Jasper Loomis, his wife Sarah, and Samuel Loomis, the plaintiffs, were appointed executors. The will was dated the 16th day of September, 1848. It purported to be signed, &amp;c., by Jasper Loomis in the presence of the witnesses, S. A. Loomis and Thomas J. Wrisley, who, it was averred, signed as witnesses in the presence of the testator.</p>

Wrisley testified, <em>inter alia: </em>I am subscribing witness to the will. It was executed by the testator in my presence. Samuel A. Loomis was the other subscribing witness. He requested Samuel A. Loomis to write his name, and he did so. He said He was not able to write his name himself. I <a id="p61" href="#p61" data-label="61" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*61</a>have seen Samuel A. Loomis' write. This is his signature. His name as a witness was written to it in my presence.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b61-6" data-blocks='[["BL_61.4",61,[165,481,1162,1295]]]'>Cross-examination.—No one but myself, Samuel A. Loomis, and the widow, in the room when the will was made. I am sure no one else was present. He survived the execution of the will about a week. The will was executed on Monday morning between one and two o’clock. I and Samuel A. Loomis had been sitting up that night. The widow had retired before the will was executed. She was up and down. Can’t tell whether Loomis or the widow brought the will in. I guess he did not take the will in his hands. He said he wanted the will signed, and witnessed when it was signed. The will was produced there drawn up as it is. The will looks like Otis Newton’s handwriting. I saw Samuel A. Loomis write the name of the testator as well as his own. Can’t tell what was done with it. Samuel A. Loomis had it when I last saw it. The words “ per S. A. Loomis per request of the testator,” I can’t say whether written there at the time or not: can’t say whose handwriting it is. He is brother to the widow. I stayed till about daylight. Jasper was raised up in the bed. He could not turn himself. He had dyspepsia. I got there from ten to eleven o’clock, A. M., Sunday. I was well acquainted with Jasper Loomis. I first saw him after dark Sunday evening. I did not shake hands with him. I only stepped to the door. The will was signed on a table or stand very near the bed. The will was not read to Jasper Loomis then, nor did he read it himself—not sealed up that I know of at the time. I have been acquainted with the handwriting of Otis sixteen or eighteen years. I can’t tell whether that is the same handwriting with the body of the will. Samuel A. Loomis came in the afternoon towards night. I saw Samuel A. Loomis write his name. I saw him write the name of Jasper Loomis. He was better towards morning. The reason I did not go in to see him was because they did not like to have people go in.</p>

She had been to rest before the will was executed. I was in and watched in the night. S. A. Loomis was out in the other room. Jasper seemed to rouse up past midnight, and wanted to know if the will was executed. I called S. A. Loomis into the room. He asked him what he wanted. He said he wanted to know if that had been attended to. Samuel asked what. He said the “will.” Samuel said “no,” and asked him if he wanted it done. He said yes. He asked if he could sign it himself. He said “no,” and requested Samuel to write his name to it. Samuel or the widow got it, and it-was executed. Samuel asked him if he knew the contents. He said he did. I should think he said it had been read to him: did not say who read it or who drew it. I don’t recollect who brought it. I don’t recollect as he wrote anything but the two names.</p>

The will was undoubtedly executed in his last sickness ; and, in the absence of counteracting proof, the presumption is that his inability continued till his death.

According to Snyder <em>v. </em>Bull, <em>ante, </em>p. 54, he was not interested when the will was executed; and had his testimony been indispensable to the establishment of it, we might be at a loss for a reason to deprive the legatees of the benefit of it, merely because he had voluntarily acquired a subsequent interest in the event. But it was not necessary. The presumption is that he was ready to sustain his attestation with his oath; and proof of his signature by two persons, was equivalent to proof of execution by a full witness. As, however, 'he might have contradicted it, the plaintiffs <a id="p64" href="#p64" data-label="64" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*64</a>were bound to offer Mm, not only to sustain tbe presumption, but to afford the defendants the benefit of a cross-examination. But the latter had no right to waive it by having him rejected in the first place, and to have the will rejected in the second, because his attestation had not been corroborated by his oath. By having him set aside, they put him in the predicament of a witness dead or out of reach of process; and in such a case, according to Hays <em>v. </em>Harden, the will might be read, so far as he was concerned, on proof of his signature; and that course ought to have been pursued here.</p>
