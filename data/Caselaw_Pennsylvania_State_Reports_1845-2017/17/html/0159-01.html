The paper was made and dated on the 26th March, 1844; Mrs. Crock, the testatrix, died on the 8d November, 1847. Crock and Root were appointed executors. The will was executed by the testatrix by making a mark in front of the seal. It was witnessed by S. H. Slingluff and Michael Crock. The plaintiffs below were legatees under the will.</p>

The witness stated, as the foundation of his belief, that he was acquainted with her mark, and that it had certain peculiarities which distinguished it from others.</p>
    <p id="b161-16" data-blocks='[["BL_161.20",161,[164,2028,1159,387]],["BL_162.1",162,[302,406,1159,131]]]'>In admitting this evidence, it is probable that the court below was influenced by the decision of Lord Chief Justice Tindal, in George <em>v. </em>Surry, 1 <em>Moody &amp; Malkin </em>516. In that case an endorsement of a bill of exchange, made by means of a <em>mark, </em>was proved by a witness not present at the act, but who stated that he “ had frequently seen the endorser make her mark, and so sign instruments;” and the witness, as in the case now before us, pointed out some peculiarity. But the weight of this decision is diminished by the considerations that it was made in the necessary <a id="p162" href="#p162" data-label="162" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*162</a>haste of a trial at Nisi Prius; that the Lord Chief Justice did not admit the evidence <em>without some hesitation ; </em>and that no objection was made to the testimony, because <em>the case was undefended.</em>

It would be far more dangerous in the case of wills, than in other instruments, where living parties may have some means of counteracting its effect. The proof of handwriting, by witnesses not present at the execution of the instrument in dispute, stands upon no higher foundation than the <em>opinion </em>of the witnesses, founded upon a comparison of the writing in dispute, with other writings recollected by them and known to be genuine. That opinion is entitled to more or less weight, according to the opportunities which the witnesses may have had for forming a correct judgment. If they had seen the party write a great deal, and frequently, much credit would be due to their opinions. If, on the contrary, they had seen him write but his name, and that only in a single instance, but little regard should be paid to such testimony: 2 <em>Star. N. P. </em>164, Powell <em>v. </em>Ford. If the witness had seen the party write only his surname, it was thought by Lord Ellenborough, that he could not be received to prove the signature ; but Lord Chief Justice Abbott entertained a different opinion, and permitted a witness who had seen the party write only his surname and the initials of his Christian name, to prove the signature: Lewis <em>v. </em>Saphio, 1 M &amp; <em>M. </em>39. In Smith <em>v. </em>Evans, 1 <em>Wils. </em>313, the objection to the substitution of a <em>seal </em>for a <em>signature </em>to a will was placed upon the ground that it would lead to forgeries, inasmuch as a seal could not be proved like the handwriting of the testator: 2 <em>Saunders Pl. </em>&amp; <em>Ev. </em>1262.</p>

Where a mark, on inspection, appears to have nothing in its construction to distinguish it from the ordinary marks used by illiterate persons to authenticate their contracts, it is not the subject of this description of evidence.</p>

The instrument before us can therefore derive no support from the retrospective provisions of the Act of 1848.
