Moore, 5 Ib. 257, settle principles which govern this case. If there is any uncertainty in the description, arising from extrinsic facts, it can be cured by testimony, like other cases of latent ambiguity.\nThe plaintiff himself being the purchaser, it was his own fault if the description was not sufficiently precise.\nJudgment reversed, and a venire de novo awarded.",
