It is the duty of a constable to pursue, search for, and arrest offenders against whom criminal process is put into his hands. It is stated in Com. Digest, title <em>Justice of the Peace, </em>B. 79, that the duty of a constable requires him to do his utmost to discover, pursue, and arrest felons. The office of constable is created not for the private emolument of the holder; but to conserve the public peace, and to execute the criminal law of the country. He is not the agent or employee of the -private prosecutor, but the minister of the law, doing the work of the public, which he is bound to do faithfully for the fee prescribed by law, to be paid as the law directs. And it would be against public policy as well as against law to hold otherwise.</p>
    <p id="b40-5" data-blocks='[["BL_40.11",40,[363,1500,1168,433]]]'>There are things which a constable is not officially bound to do, such as to procure evidence, and the like, and for this he may perhaps be allowed to contract. And this is the full extent of the principle in the case cited from 11. Ad. and El. 856. But it has been held that even a sailor cannot recover for extra work on a promise by the master to pay for extra work in managing the ship in peril, the sailor being bound to do his utmost independently of any fresh contract, Stilk <em>v. </em>Myrick, 2 Camp. 317, and the cases there cited.</p>

It ought not to be permitted. Constables must do their utmost to discover, pursue, and arrest offenders within their township, district, or jurisdiction, without other fee or reward than that given by the law itself.</p>
