J. — “ The instrument of writing set forth in this case, is what is technically called a covenant to stand seised to uses. The words are sufficient to create the covenant, the intention -being apparent on the face of this deed, that each party should stand seised to the use of the other surviving him, under the circumstances stated. And the consideration of natural love, though not expressed, is manifest from the relation of the parties; and as this, being consistent with the deed, might be averred in pleading, and admitted in evidence, it is not essentially necessary that it should be mentioned in <em>the </em>instrument: Milburn <em>v. </em>Salkeld, Whiles, 673; Bedell’s case, 7 Rep. 40; Crossing <em>v. </em>Scudamore, 1 Ventr. 137; 3 Cruise’s Dig. part iv. 186, 190. Being of this opinion, I think judgment, on the case stated, should be for the defendant.</p>
