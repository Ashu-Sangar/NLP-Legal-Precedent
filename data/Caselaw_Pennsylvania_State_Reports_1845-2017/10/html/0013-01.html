In that case tbe corporation was expressly forbidden to issue sucb notes, but there is an equally implied prohibition in tbe charter of this company. [Rogers, J. Should not that be made to appear by an affidavit ?] Tbe charter is given by an act of tbe legislature, and tbe court must take judicial cognisance of it. If not a negotiable instrument, tbe plaintiff cannot sue; if it is, then, there being no authority granted to issue sucb instruments, tbe settled rule that corporations have no powers but what are expressly or by implication granted them, shows tbe note to be void under tbe policy of tbe law. •</p>

Tbe filing of tbe cause of action is not to set it out with technical precision, but to individuate tbe transaetion from which it springs, tbe declaration and plea forming tbe issue on which tbe parties are to go to trial. Nor does it follow that tbe cause of action filed is to control tbe cause of action stated in tbe declaration, provided tbe same contract or transaction be tbe subject-matter of each. He may waive defects in tbe first instance, and reserve himself for bis demurrer or motion in arrest of judgment, provided a good cause of action be not laid in tbe <em>narr.; </em>but then be must show that be waives nothing, and that be bas a defence at least on tbe plaintiff’s own showing; which be can do only in tbe manner prescribed in the act of Assembly.
