Whether a tenant holding over for an indefinite period must give notice, is the only question. That the law in England requires a notice, both from landlord and tenant, is apparent from every text-book and decided case: 1 Wm. Bl. 533; 2 Ib. 1224; 1 T. R. 162; 4 B. &amp; Cr. 922. Woodfall on L. &amp; Ten. 250; Comy, on Ib. 285-8. It is equally certain that in Pennsylvania there must be a notice by the landlord; 8 S. &amp; R. 466; <a href="/rawle/4/0123-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Rawle 123" data-case-ids="1823547" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0123-01">4 Raw. 123</a>-7; and in the former case it is said to be reciprocal.</p>

It is not within the contract, nor required by any statute, nor has any decision yet announced this to be an implied part of the contract, nor has it been so understood by the profession, and it is denied in 8 S. &amp; R. 469. The parties so understood it. The landlord raised the rent without a full quarter’s notice, and the tenant has quitted on the same notice. The landlord, it is true, did not eject him by summary proceedings without three months’ notice, but this is under the statute, giving the landlord a jury, &amp;c. But it is for him to contract for this privilege if he see fit. No case has decided this in England, though there are loose <em>dicta, </em>and they <a id="p42" href="#p42" data-label="42" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*42</a>are founded on the statute 2 Geo. 2, giving double rent for holding over, 1 Wm.
