It has been supposed to decide there can be no warranty without express words. The rule of the civil law, that a sound price implies a sound article, is not contended for; nor is it sought to interfere with the rule, that where nothing is said, it suffices if the article exists in specie. But, if the vendor undertakes to say anything, and induces the vendee to rely on the assertion, he is bound by it, for the vendee may presume it is so, and is not bound to examine. It will be observed, the question is not whether this evidence is conclusive that a warranty existed, but whether the jury might infer from it, that a warranty was intended as to <em>Jcind </em>or <em>quality. </em>Now it is settled that no form of words is essential: “I warrant” is usual, but <em>“ </em>I represent,” “I affirm,” will answer equally well, and it can scarcely be doubted, that if Chandelor <em>v. </em>Lopus was to be decided now, the court would hold, “I affirm the stone to be a bezoar stone,” to amount to an allegation of warranty that it was so. Great brevity is used in all mercantile contracts, and the heading of the bill of parcels, which is evidence of the parol contract, may read, “I affirm this tobacco- to be superior sweet-scented Kentucky leaf tobacco.” This further appears from the letters of the plaintiffs; they there call it a guaranty; the evidence is distinct that it was neither superior sweet-scented, nor sweet-scented at all; the witness says, it was quite the contrary. So that the case is narrowed to this inquiry, is there any evidence, from which a jury might infer a warranty as to kind or quality? To say that it is tobacco, is nothing. The various kinds of tobacco rank as different articles of merchandise. The cases bear out this view. In 4 Camp. 144, a description of goods in a written contract was held to imply a warranty they are merchantable under that denomination, and the exhibition of samples does not qualify the rule. To the same effect is 6 Taunt. 446, where the warranty arose from a description in the heading of a sale-note. 5 Bing. 533, decides that no particular form of words is essential, but that a seller, knowing the qualities of the animal, undertakes they are those expressly required by the purchaser. In 2 Bing. N. C. <a id="p323" href="#p323" data-label="323" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*323</a>668, a contract to sell mess pork of S. &amp; Co., was held to mean pork manufactured by S. &amp; Co.; and there also the warranty arose from a description in the sold-note. In 4 Ad. &amp; El. 473, the heading of a bill of parcels of pictures, containing the name of the artist, was held to be evidence of a warranty they were painted by such artist. In <a href="/mass/19/0229-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Pick. 214" data-case-ids="2049708" data-case-paths="/mass/19/0229-01">2 Pick. 214</a>, the sale-note <em>“ of </em>prime quality winter oil” was held a warranty that it was winter, and not summer-strained oil. The difference between these is no greater than in the tobacco, as sold, and as it existed in this case. In 7 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 480, and Chapman <em>v. </em>Murch, <a href="/johns/19/0290-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="19 Johns. 290" data-case-ids="380544" data-case-paths="/johns/19/0290-01">19 John. 290</a>, the same error was committed by the judge at Nisi Prius, in withdrawing the evidence from the jury. In the former, by telling them that a representation wus an express warranty; in the latter, by telling them it was not evidence from which they might infer a warranty. In both cases it was for the' jury to draw an inference of warranty, as was held in 2 Car. &amp; Pay. 211. The error in putting a legal construction upon oral words is pointed out in <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.%2069" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="9 W. 69">9 W. 69</a>. In 3 W. C.

It is, moreover, proved that the ■tobacco was in kind the article said' to be sold. It was Kentucky leaf tobacco certainly. Whether there was a warranty of the quality, is the only question. This seems to be settled in this state. 3 W. C. C. R. 165 was an advertisement of white glass — held no warranty. 7 S. &amp; R. 480 decides the very point — the seller is not bound to answer for the goodness of wares, unless there be an express warranty or fraudulent representation; and it is there said, “from the time of Chandelor <em>v. </em>Lopus, the doctrine has been that a bare affirmation of quality will not' give an action, unless the vendor knew it not to be as represented.” <a href="/citations/?q=3%20R.%2023" class="citation" data-index="6" data-cite="3 R. 23">3 R. 23</a> was to the <a id="p324" href="#p324" data-label="324" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*324</a>same effect — the case being a sale of dirt as bine paint, and it was put on the fact that there was not a correspondence in kind. <a href="/citations/?q=3%20R.%20168" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="3 R. 168">3 R. 168</a> was a case of an adulterated article, and yet, because it was known in the market under the name by which it was sold, there Was no warranty. In <a href="/citations/?q=9%20W.%2055" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="9 W. 55">9 W. 55</a>, it was held no implied warranty arises from a false affirmation; the only remedy is an action for deceit; nor is the affirmation evidence of the warranty. These cases establish the rule of this state, and must govern, though other laws differ. 4 Camp. 144 was, however, a case turning on the difference in kind in the market. 6 Taunt. 446 turned chiefly on the admissibility of the usage, nor can it be discovered how the plaintiff counted. In 5 Bing. 533, there was parol evidence of the warranty. 3 Bing. N. C. 668 and 4 A. &amp; E. 473 were on the differences in kind.

But, after all, the court are of opinion that no warranty was established which was competent to go to the jury, under either of the counts in the <em>narr. </em>The cause seems to be conclusively governed by the case of Borrekins <em>v. </em>Bevan, <a href="/citations/?q=3%20R.%2023" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="3 R. 23">3 R. 23</a>, in which the doctrine of Chandelor <em>v. </em>Lopus, Cro. Jas. 4, is dismissed with disapprobation, and the rule established that, in all sales of goods by bills of parcels, samples, &amp;c., there is an implied warranty, that the article delivered shall correspond in specie with the commodity sold, unless there are facts and circumstances to show that the purchaser took upon himself the risk of the <em>hind </em>as well as the <em>quality </em>of the commodity purchased. If that case means anything, it means this, that when the thing is sold by sample, and without express warranty, the purchaser takes it at his own risk, unless it <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>should prove to be an article different in kind; all gradations in quality are at the hazard of the buyer. But if an article was sold as a. diamond, and turned out to be glass, or when the thing was sold as tea, and was, in fact, chaff, the vendor would be responsible ; thus rendering the seller liable for a difference in kind, but not for a difference in quality. Whether the rule in Chandelor and Lopus, to wit, <em>express warranty or fraud, </em>in all cases, both as to kind and quality, was better than the one established in Borrekins <em>v. </em>Bevan, is a matter of little import now. It is useless to wander darkling among the dust and mist of old cases, to determine which was best, or most authoritatively recognised. Borrekins <em>v. </em>Bevan has been repeatedly acknowledged by this court, and is now the law; that is sufficient. Let us test this case by it. The sale by the bill of parcels, with which perhaps the sample corresponded, was of sweet-scented Kentucky leaf tobacco. It is not pretended that the article delivered wa's not tobacco, nor that it was anything else than Kentucky leaf tobacco. But, it is alleged and proved, that it was of inferior quality, and perhaps not very sweet-scented. The witnesses examined at Liverpool say that it was of a low, mean quality. The gist of the whole case, on the part of the plaintiffs, is, that the tobacco delivered was not of a quality equal to the sample, but of inferior flavour, taste, and quality.</p>
    <p id="b325-4" data-blocks='[["BL_325.4",325,[104,1582,1174,83]]]'>It was in specie Kentucky leaf tobacco, in kind the same as the article sold.</p>
