      <em>March </em>12. The plaintiff having obtained a judgment, issued a <em>fi. fa. </em>and a <em>Uberari, </em>which the sheriff returned, that he had given possession of the premises. The plaintiff then brought an action for a false return, and proved that the premises were held, at the date of the return, by a tenant, under a demise for five years from the defendant in the execution, commencing before the date of plaintiff’s judgment. The sheriff did not put plaintiff into actual possession, but gave notice to the tenant to pay him the rent.</p>
