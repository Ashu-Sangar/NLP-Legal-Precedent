From this, it appeared that a <em>fi.fa. </em>had been issued by Bingham et al., and a levy made, Feb. 21, on <a id="p396" href="#p396" data-label="396" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*396</a>the goods in the defendant’s store. At the instance and on the responsibility of the plaintiff in the execution, the sheriff appointed one Zeigler his deputy, who, with the defendants in the execution, made private sales of the' goods at the store, as in the ordinary course of business. This arrangement continued for some days, and until other executions were left with the sheriff; Zeigler receiving the money and accounting to the sheriff. There was some evidence that Zeigler was a partner with the defendants. When the subsequent executions were issued the store was closed, and a public sale made March 4th, which was before the return-day of any of the writs.</p>

The publicity of judicial sales is, in every aspect in which the matter can be received, a requisite of indispensable necessity, and in accordance with the whole statutory polity on the subject. Secret or private sales of personal property, by an officer of the law charged with execution, is not countenanced by any adjudicated case of which I am aware, in this state.</p>

On the 28th February, 1848, some of the other creditors issued execution, and gave notice to the sheriff, that as he had not proceeded on the <em>fi. fa. </em>of Bingham &amp; Brothers, he was required to proceed on the writs then put into his hands, or hold himself responsible. The plaintiff then took actual possession of the store, and shut it up. The first arrangement made by the parties was against law, and might be destructive to the interests of creditors. Under colour of such arrangement's, property might be sacrificed, or transferred by collusion between the execution-creditor and the debtor, to the manifest injury of other creditors, whereby they would be obstructed and hindered in the collection of their debts. In England the sheriff cannot detain the goods in his own hands, and satisfy the debt with his proper money; but he ought to sell them, for the law requires of sheriffs a strict observance and execution of the writs directed to them: Noy’s R. 107, and Langdon <em>v. </em>Wallis, Lutw. 589. Neither ought the goods to be delivered to the defendant, but ought to be sold: 2 Vent. 95; Impey’s Shff. 129-36.</p>

But here these sales were made by arrangement of the plaintiff and the sheriff and the debtor, by which sales were made without <em>any notice; </em>not even made by the sheriff, but by one of the partners during a space of seven days, during which time all that was valuable might have disappeared under colour of legal authority, whereby the subsequent execution-creditors would have been greatly hindered and obstructed. It is the policy of the law to shut up and close plain avenues to fraud and collusion, through which creditors may be obstructed and hindered, even though there be no actual fraud in the particular case.</p>
