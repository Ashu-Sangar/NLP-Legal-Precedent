On the 21st May he obtained an award, and issued a <em>fi. fa. </em>Upon this, he moved for the appointment of a sequestrator. The defendant’s wife appeared to the rule, and set forth, that she was the devisee of certain lands from her father, under a will dated in 1835. And she objected to the appointment, on the ground] that, by the act of April 11th, 1848, she was entitled to hold the property to her separate use. But the court appointed a sequestrator, and this appeal was taken.</p>

The act in this case was, therefore, constitutional. But are we at liberty so to interpret it as to give it a retroactive operation against a creditor who had brought an action and incurred costs, at the time of the enactment, when there was no law to forbid the pursuit, with a view to obtain a lien and satisfaction out of the husband’s curtesy ? The rule has been, to give a retroactive operation to statutes which operate, notion the right, but the remedy; and here it would operate on both. According to the principle of the Lancaster County Bank <em>v. </em>Stouffer, just now decided <em>(anté, </em>398), the husband had an indefeasible freehold in his wife’s land, which was open to action by his creditors; and, by the opposite principle, them right to seek satisfaction from the land, by actions previously commenced, would be taken away. But a more stringent principle still, is that which has governed us in refusing a retroactive operation to statutes which would bar an action pending, where we are not compelled to do otherwise by direct and positive words; as in Bedford <em>v. </em>Shilling, 4 S. &amp; R. 401, and subsequent cases. These embrace the principle of the case before us; and, so far, the opinion of the judge was incontrovertible; and, as has been said in the Lancaster Bank <em>v. </em>Stouffer, there was no right of appeal. The case must, therefore, take the course of its predecessor.</p>
