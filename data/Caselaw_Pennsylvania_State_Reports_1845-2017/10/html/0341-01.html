They showed that, in 1824, this tract, with several others, had been sold to one Staples, for taxes then due. A deed for this tract had been acknowledged by the treasurer; but, as will be seen, it was never delivered to the purchaser. The defendants traced their title from Staples, by his deed to G. Donnel, in October, 1829, and other subsequent conveyances. It was in evidence, that the total amount of the bids made by Staples at the sale was $129.60. The amount due for taxes on the tracts sold was $87.68. Staples paid in cash, at the time of the sale, $34.36. This amount was the purchase-money of certain of the tracts so sold, other than the one in question, and it was so appropriated and entered on the books. Staples gave his note to the treasurer for $59.57, as the balance of the purchase-money. But he never executed the bonds for the surplus which would remain after payment of the taxes. In June, 1825, the treasurer settled with the county; and there was contradictory evidence, whether he was charged with this note, or the balance of the purchase-money.

They gave in evidence, that the William Grreen tract was taxed from 1815 to 1824 inclusive, and that on the 16th of June, of the latter year, it was struck off to one Edward Staples, under whom the defendants claimed. It was in evidence, that Staples’ first, and indeed only appearance in Northumberland county, was at the sales in June, 1824, when he bid off this tract and some fourteen others. He paid some-money, part of which would seem to have been applied on the books of the treasurer, and gave a written memorandum to the treasurer Weiser, to pay on the acknowledgment of the deeds, at the next August court, the balance of $59.87. There was no money marked on the treasurer’s books paid on the William Grreen tract. It was struck off at $9.51. The taxes and costs amounted to $9.20J. At the August court, Weiser, the treasurer, acknow<a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>ledged the deed, and in the course of the ensuing winter he sent that deed, with others, to the city of Philadelphia, with the written evidence of the balance due; but, after diligent search, Staples could not be found. The papers were returned to Weiser, who went out of office. When Judge Witman died did not appear, but his son and administrator came to Sunbury in the latter part of 1828, or the beginning of 1829, when he called on Weiser and paid him $13.28J, the amount of taxes and costs due from 1815, and lifted the treasurer’s deed, that had been made out, but not receipted on, for Staples; after this he applied to the Orphans’ Court of Northumberland county for an order of sale, to pay the debts of his father, when the William Oreen tract was duly advertised, and sold as the property of William Witman, and the sale confirmed by the Orphans’ Court, to Hugh Bellas, for $300. Was the title of Wit-man divested by the treasurer’s sale, and was that title vested in Staples? The spirit and object of the several acts of the legislature which authorize the sale of unseated lands for the payment of taxes, are to compel and enforce the prompt payment of the annual assessments. Of the acts now in force on this subject, the first is the act of the 3d of April, 1804 (Purd. 1135, 4 Sm. L. 201), which directs the sheriff or coroner of the proper county, to give notice and advertise in the manner prescribed in the act, and to make sale of the whole or any part of such tract of unseated land as he may find necessary for the payment of the taxes due thereon, and of all costs necessarily accrued by reason of such delinquency, <em>and to malee and execute a deed or deeds in fee-simple to the purchaser or purchasers.</em>

To remedy these evils, and insure prompt payment at treasurer’s sale, the legislature, on the 13th March, 1817 (Purd. 1141; 6 Sm. 426), enacted, that it should be the duty of the purchaser or purchasers, at treasurer’s sale, <em>as soon as the property is struck down, to pay the amount of the purchase-money, or such part thereof as shall be necessary to pay off the taxes and costs; also one dollar for the use of the prothonotary, for entering the acknowledgment of the deed; and in case the amount is not forthwith paid after the property is struck down, the sale .may be avoided, and the property again set up by the treasurer.</em>

Here the treasurer did not adhere to the act of Assembly; he trusted Staples, and took his written memorandum to pay when the deed was acknowledged. He never paid, and never received the deed. The trusting him by the treasurer, for a short time, when he absconded and never fulfilled the trust reposed in him by the treasurer, surely gave him no title, nor did it divest the title of Judge Witman, the original owner. It is contended, that as some of the tracts bid off by Staples were redeemed, that it was money in the hands of Weiser, that might have been applied to the payment of the taxes and costs on this tract. On this branch of the case, there was much evidence on both sides, and some that was contradictory. The coiu’t left it to the jury to determine whether Weiser, the treasurer, paid or settled with the county auditors for the amount of the taxes due on the William Green tract, which Staples had become liable to pay by his bid. The jury, by their verdict, negatived the fact relied on by the defendants ; and this, in my judgment, was leaving the case more favourable Tor Staples than the law would authorize. When Staples made the bid, he became liable, by the act of 1817, to pay the taxes and costs, or to be sued by the treasurer, in the name of the county, for the same. His title was not vested until he paid the taxes and costs, and gave his bond for the surplus. This he neglected for upwards of five years (nor did he ever attempt to perfect his title), when the representative of the original owner appeared, paid the <a id="p346" href="#p346" data-label="346" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*346</a>taxes and costs, and lifted the deed, that had never been delivered to Staples, and which he had never entitled himself to receive.</p>

Donnel, for the consideration of one dollar, was to have an interest in the one-half of the William Green and other tracts. Mr. Donnel was an experienced surveyor and woodsman; directly after this arrangement, he was struck with paralysis, and died in 1826. The record furnishes no evidence of any other act of Henry Donnel. It is in evidence that, directly after young Witman paid the taxes and costs, and lifted the treasurer’s deed, Charles G. Donnel, the son of Henry, and a gentleman of respectable standing at the Northumberland bar, called on Weiser about these deeds, and, as proved by Weiser, inquired whether Mr. Witman did not get a deed from him that had been made out for Staples. Weiser replied in the affirmative, when Mr. Donnel requested him not to part with any of these Staples deeds to anybody else. He said he was going to Philadelphia, and he would see whether he could find Staples; that he had an interest in the lands. Weiser told Donnel that he had given up the deed to Witman, as he said the land belonged to his father, and he had paid him the taxes and costs. After this, Judge Donnel went to Philadelphia, and on the 31st of October, 1829, he obtained a deed from Staples for the William Green, and for four other tracts, for the consideration of $103.74.
