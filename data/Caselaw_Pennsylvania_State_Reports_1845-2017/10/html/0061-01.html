The names of the real owners are not mentioned, and this in a transaction of $13,000. But the law is, where the agent receives and deposits money as his own, with no separation from his funds, or special designation— when the specific property of the principal cannot be identified— he becomes a mere debtor to his principal, and creditor of the depositary. This must be the rule, or there is a wide door opened for fraud. It is applied to render agents liable for losses in such cases, on the ground that they have made the debt theirs by mixing the funds: 4 Mad. 414; 1 J. W. 247; 11 Ves. 377. In this case the liability of the proceeds of a bill to attachment by a creditor of the banker is admitted by Lord Eldon, Ib. 381; 3 Ib. 365, n.; 2 Stor. Eq. § 1270. So in 11 Ves. 59, it is said to be a using in the course of trade, because he gets a credit by it— and in 15 Ib. 470, that it would be part of the agent’s assets: Lew. on Trusts, 300.

A bill of exceptions would be improper for the matter alleged and already certain: 2 Inst. 427. If the funds deposited were the property of one person, he could follow it, and there can be no difference where there are several owners. The doctrine in Tayler <em>v. </em>Plummer, 3 M. &amp; Sel. 562, is broad enough to cover the case, and it was there held that no change of form could alter the rights of an owner to property clothed with a trust, which was approved.in <a href="/citations/?q=3%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20377" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="3 Watts &amp; Serg. 377">3 W. &amp; S. 377</a>-8.

This court has carried out the rule in 11 S. &amp; R. 377, and 2 Penna. 347, that funds improperly applied by an agent may always be followed, unless received <em>bond fide </em>for value, and without notice. No case, however, is stronger than the much-contested one of Small <em>v. </em>Attwood, 1 Young, 407. It was there conceded that certain bank-notes paid on a contract set aside by the court, had been paid into a banker, and an equal amount invested by him in stocks — and the Chancellor said it was immaterial whether the identical notes were so used, or other funds of the same value. The cases cited are not similar. The point there was, whether the agent was personally liable for putting the funds to this hazard, not whether the principal could not follow them if he chose. As to the bills, their proceeds could in no ease be attached — it would be a fraud. They were purchased, and to say the bank was bound to withhold the agreed price would be to compel them to commit a fraud.</p>

Suppose the bills were purchased; to say that the bank was justified in paying over the price, would be to repeal the act which binds all effects coming into the hands of the garnishee after the attachment; but in fact they were discounted, and the proceeds passed to Warwick’s credit.</p>

But the garnishee chose to be sole judge and umpire, and pay out the money to Warwick on his checks, thus in fact recognising his right to the possession and control of the money, and yet taking the hazard of defeating the object of the attachment. The first question that occurs is this: could the bank, if the attachment had not been served, have resisted the claim of Warwick to the money he had deposited with them ? They received it and the bills as his, entered them on their books as his, and were bound, in the absence of any attachment, to have gaid the funds to him. How, then, were they placed in a better situation by the service of the attachment ? The attaching creditor stands in the place of Warwick. If they could not allege as against Warwick, that the funds were not his, neither can they allege against the attaching creditor that they are not his, and yet turn found and pay the money to Warwick, to enable him to defeat his creditor. In Sergeant on Attachment, 94, it is said that the garnishee may plead everything to the scire <em>facias </em>which he could plead against the defendant; and if they could have pleaded against the defendant that the money and the products of the bills were not his, why did they pay them to defendant after being warned by attachment ? The law countenances not those operations by which its legitimate force and effect may be evaded. Thus, in the case of Silverwood <em>v. </em>Bellas, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20W.%20420" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="8 W. 420">8 W. 420</a>, it was resolved that Silverwood, the garnishee, who had received money in <em>trust, </em>to deliver it over to the defendant, was liable because he did deliver it over. Here it cannot be gainsayedbut that the bank was bound to deliver over the money to the defendant in the absence of the attachment. It is worthy of remark that the person alleged by the garnishee to be the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>never gave notice to the attaching creditor <a id="p68" href="#p68" data-label="68" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*68</a>of any claim — never appeared in court to move that the attachment should he quashed, nor took any step asserting ownership, or indicative of it.</p>

Under these circumstances, it is against public policy that the garnishee, that is, the bank, should be permitted to allege that the books were false, for the purpose of defeating the creditor, and yet true for the purpose of paying over the funds to the defendant. Here is the case of a ma.n who had been declared a bankrupt in England, and came to this country and transacted a business to the amount of one hundred thousand dollars and more in the United States Bank, in his own name, and when the funds are attached in the hands of the institution, they are paid over to the - defendant — not paid to the person who is alleged to have been the <em>cestui que trust, </em>and the defendant, the <em>cestui que trust, </em>and the cashier, are the witnesses to make out the case. It is impossible to look upon the case without vehement apprehension that, if it is allowed to pass into precedent, and make the law of analogous cases, the most disastrous frauds might be the result. The house of Rogers &amp; Co. was located in New York, Rogtrs himself was absent on the continent of Europe, and Sagory, the partner, in New York, swears that he knew Warwick personally first in the year 1837, which shows that confidence was of marvellously rapid growth. Whether the debt of the plaintiffs was incurred by Warwick in the course of his dealing on the strength of this fund or not, is not particularly stated in the case. We fear it would open too wide a door for the infliction of fraud, if such practices were tolerated. An individual made out to be insolvent, may have $100,000, nay, twice that amount, in a bank, entered on its books in his own name, his checks accepted and paid. What amount of credit may he not obtain upon this lure held out to the community ? If the cashier, and the party claiming the money, or any other persons, are permitted to prove that the entries are untrue, that the depositor has not a cent in the bank, the injury may be deep and grievous to credit, and the source of severe loss to those who have put faith in the integrity and uprightness of banking institutions. The law will not give its help to assist one man to cheat others. It is on this principle that a real <em>bond fide </em>change of possession, apparent to the public, must accompany and follow the sale of chattels in order to take them <a id="p69" href="#p69" data-label="69" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*69</a>out of the power of the creditor of the vendor. Indeed, the whole fabric of the 13 Eliz. is built on this foundation; and it is of no consequence whether or not there was actual fraud, in the absence of this essential ingredient of change of possession. It is public policy, and the danger of opening a door for fraud, which furnishes the reason and the justification of the rule, and which are so strong and emphatic as to overbear particular instances. So in this analogous case the danger is the same, and the remedy is not different. In both the apparent state of things, that which meets the eye of the public, ought to govern. The garnishee, in this instance, after having paid the money to the defendant, and by its own books, papers, and records, given the evidence that it was his, shall not be permitted to allege the contrary for the purpose of protecting itself in a wrongful act. The duty of the garnishee was, having received the money and bills as the money and bills of Warwick from himself, to have retained them until liberated by due course of law. Warwick says in his testimony, “ As to credits for cash credited in my account, I state that I received from Rogers &amp; Co., and other persons in the United States, on and subsequent to November, 1838, funds to be used on their account, ■which funds were deposited by me in the Bank of the United States.” The names of the other persons are not given. But the sums and amounts are all blended into one, and deposited as his own. Now, where is the earmark, about which much was said ? How much belonged to Rogers &amp; Co., and how much and in what sums to the others unknown ? There are some things which appear plausible, but this assertion of Warwick being the trustee of persons unknown, passes credulity. Even suppose he got this money from many persons, and used it as his own, he became the debtor of those persons, and they lost their grip on the fund. And by mingling this fund with the products of the bills, domestic and foreign, and using the whole as his own, <em>ad </em>libitum, and depositing it as such in the bank, this deposit in the bank, so made and evidenced, created a debt or duty from the bank to Warwick, and not any specific or distinct debt or duty to Rogers or the other persons unknown. The debt or. duty to Warwick was entire and in mass; and, by paying it to him in the face of the attachment and garnishment, the defendants became liable to the plaintiff in attachment.</p>
