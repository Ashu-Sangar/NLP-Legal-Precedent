J., in rejecting the evidence, said: “ Much as I dislike the practice of raising questions by exceptions 'to evidence, on tbe decision of which depend tbe principles of law which must rule tbe cause, yet I know there are cases in which evidence cannot safely be received, leaving the effect of it, under tbe direction of tbe court, to tbe jury, and this is one of them. Tbe competence of tbe evidence before me must be determined in tbe first instance, and I have no difficulty in sustaining tbe objection. It was accurately said by Chief Justice McKean, in Lawson <em>v. </em>Morrison, 2 Dali. 286, that tbe destruction of a will which repealed or superseded a previous one, leaves tbe first as if tbe second bad not existed, unless it be clearly proved that tbe second was destroyed with a view to die intestate. Such is tbe result whether the second contain a clause of revocation or not; for neither of them takes effect till tbe testator’s death; tbe revocation of tbe second restores tbe first to tbe footing on which it stood before tbe second existed;. and tbe first necessarily, as well as naturally, takes effect at tbe death, unless the testator bad signified by some decisive act or declaration, at tbe time of tbe revocation, an intention to die intestate ; or unless there was a change in tbe state of bis family, an alteration in tbe nature of bis estate, or other circumstances, which, independently of tbe second .will, would be a revocation of tbe first. But tbe intention must exist at tbe time of tbe destruction, for if it does not, tbe first will is restored to its. former standing as of course, and being so, it cannot subsequently be revoked by anything that would not have revoked it had tbe second not been made. But what is tbe proper evidence of tbe testator’s intention at that <a id="p86" href="#p86" data-label="86" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*86</a>time ? Undoubtedly contemporary declarations of it, or the intermediate occurrence of circumstances 'which would be independent grounds of revocation, without aid borrowed from the existence of a subsequent will. To allow declarations of intention entertained at a subsequent time, or subsequent circumstances, to be evidence of the testator’s intention at the time of the cancellation, would be no less than to give them the effect of a parol revocation, which is forbidden by the statute. On this ground I have been led to doubt one of the principles of Boudinot <em>v. </em>Bradford, 2 Dali. 266, S. C., 2 Yeat. 170, to say nothing of Lawson <em>v. </em>Morrison, notwithstanding the well-merited reputation of Chief Justice McKean, and no less the merited reputation of Chief Justice Tilghman, who gave those cases his approbation. In the first of them, Dr. Bush was allowed to prove the testator’s death-bed intention to die intestate, as evidence of his intention when he destroyed a will which had, for a time, been superseded by a preceding one. What was* that but to make his declaration indirectly an equivalent for a parol revocation? The testator had not declared his intention when he cancelled the second will, but he declared it only at the time when he was speaking; and on no principle of law or reason could his intention then be taken for a true sample of a preceding one. In Moritz <em>v. </em>Brough, 16 S. &amp; B. 403, declarations’ of a testator, posterior to his execution of his will, that he had intended to make a different disposition of his property, but that he had been driven from it by fear of violence on the part of his wife, were held tobe incompetent, and though my brother Bogers and myself dissented, it was not because we thought such declarations would be competent to repel a presumption like the present, but because we thought them evidence of duress on the ground of necessity. The case of Oldfield <em>v. </em>Nelson, 2 Vern. 76, in which similar declarations were received, to persuade a Chancellor that it was not his duty to lend himself to the execution, of a testamentary trust, was of that stamp. As I have already said, the acts and declarations at the time of the cancellation, or such an intervening change in the state of his family, such as marriage and the birth of a child, or such an alteration in the nature of his estate, or such other circumstance as would be an independent ground of revocation, can alone rebut the presumption of an intention to revive a precedent will, which the law raises from the cancellation or destruction of a subsequent one. Now, the death of a child will not revoke a precedent will, nor will it rebut the implication of an intent equivocally expressed to restore it, after it has been displaced, to its former standing. <a id="p87" href="#p87" data-label="87" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*87</a>It requires direct and express evidence to do that, for we should have no rule on the subject, and no certainty of result, did we allow juries to weigh probabilities. The evidence of the death of the testator’s daughter, and of the time of it, therefore, is excluded.”</p>

Such was the effect of the will of 1821. But when the will of 1824 was executed, being equally effective as a conveyance, it annihilated the,previous one. How then can it be said that the prior'will, which he had thus solemnly declared had ceased to contain his intention, has any future effect as evidence of that intent ? While it is conceded that the second will operates as a revocation of the first, it is said the cancellation of the second revives the first, because it was not annulled or destroyed. To annul is “to reduce to nothing:” and does not a revocation reduce to nothing ? It is to render “ of no worth; to invalidate.” In fact it is a destruction of everything but the mere paper and ink. When the will of 1824 was cancelled, there was a declared intent it should not operate to convey the property; and if at that time his intent was, that the will of 1821 should not continue to be his will, the cancellation did not revive it. Now the intention of cancellation, whether with a view to die intestate, or to revive a prior will, can only be gathered from circumstances, as was conceded <em>arguendo </em>in <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Dall.%20288" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 Dall. 288">2 Dall. 288</a>. Until this intent be established, the will of 1821 remains revoked; and we offered to show that no such intent existed. It was conceded we were not estopped from proving it. We did not offer parol evidence of an intention to revoke, but merely to rebut the legal presumption of an intent to revive, arising from a revocation of that, which he had revoked. This may always be done by parol. Tt was so conceded in <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Dall.%20288" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Dall. 288">2 Dall. 288</a>. The cases of rebutting resulting trusts by implication are to the same effect. <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Dall.%20267" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="2 Dall. 267">2 Dall. 267</a>, 2 Yeat. 170, reiterates the very point, and the evidence was received. But when was the cancellation made ? It is said the date written opposite to it shows the time; but that is the date of the will, and it cannot be presumed to have been done then. The true presumption is, it was done when the will of 1835 was made. But it is held that no subsequent words can increase or vary the effect of a <a id="p88" href="#p88" data-label="88" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*88</a>will: <a href="/rawle/4/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="4 Rawle 323" data-case-ids="1823526" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0323-01">4 Raw. 323</a>: how, then, can this equivocal word have effect to make the will relate back to its former date, 1821 ? It is then said, that if it does operate as a new will- from the time of its revival, the part before the signature is valid, and the unsigned part void: but that was.denied in 6 Barr, 409. In effect, the decision is-to allow parol evidence only on one side. The revival of the will is proved by parol evidence of the cancellation of a subsequent will. If that is inadmissible, there is no revival; if admissible, .contradictory evidence of the same sort is also admissible.</p>

    <p id="Aun" data-blocks='[["BL_88.5",88,[371,964,1178,1290]]]'>The point now raised, strikes at the root of a settled rule of conveyancing — one, too, so clear, that Lord Mansfield, not disposed to adhere tp rules not founded in reason, refused to hear argument against it. The effort is, to apply the rules of the ecclesiastical courts, respecting testaments, to overturn the uniform rule of the common-law courts governing wills. By the civil law, the making of a second will annulled a prior will, without regard to the inconsistency of the two instruments; and this because the mere appointment of an executor made him testamentary heir, both of realty and personalty: 2 Dom. Pt. 2, B. 3, Tit. 1, § 3; 1 Ib. Pt. 2, B. 1, Tit. 1, § 1; 1 Cowp. 90. There could not be two testaments: 1 Wms. Ex. 88; Swinb. 523. To revive the former will on cancellation of the second, required the same formalities as the making a new will. This doctrine has been modified in the ecclesiastical .courts. But the common law doctrine was wholly different: all the instruments are, by that law, ambulatory until the death of the testator. Then they operate as voluntary conveyances or appointments from the dates of their execution, subject only to revocation, <em>pro tanto, </em>or in the whole by subsequent inconsistent wills: Cowp. 90; 1 Saund. 276, f. n. 4; 1 P. Wms. 575; 11 Mod. 122; 2 Ves. 427. So far is this carried, that it must appear affirmatively, that the subseqent will was inconsistent, or contained an express clause of revocation: 1 Saund. 278-9, n. 4; 1 Jarm. 156-8; 1 Pow. on Dev. 517-18; Cro. Eiz. 721; 1 Show. 537; Ib. P. C. 146; 7 Bro. P. C. 443; 3 Wils. 497; 2 Bla. 127; 2 East, 488.</p>

N. P. 266. This, then, is the doctrine of the common law; that, apart from any question of intention, the first will is revived by a cancellation of the revoking will. That intent may, however, be rebutted in the ecclesiastical courts: Pow. on Dev. 528, n. 7. But now the rule seems to be, that the admission of declarations to rebut the presumption, is the only distinction: 2 Addams, 116. The -rules of these- courts do not prevail here, except so far as adopted by the acts of Assembly.

It is said the evidence was admissible, because the act of cancelling was equivocal. That is true; but it is only equivocal as to the intent — if done with a view to destroy, it is not equivocal as to the consequences which flow from it — whether it was done by accident or mistake, or through ignorance, the cases agree may be proved, and then the act is without effect. But such were not the offers nor the tendency of the evidence. None of them were admissible as part of the <em>res gestx, </em>nor were any declarations of any intent in the act of cancellation, other than the act implied. Subsequent declarations of an intent not to revive the former will, could not be received — they are excluded by the acts of 1705 and 1833: 2 Yeat. 170; 16 S. &amp; R. 403; <a href="/watts-serg/2/0450-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="2 Watts &amp; Serg. 450" data-case-ids="1853563" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/2/0450-01">2 W. &amp; S. 450</a>, 455; 2 H.

The sales made, only operated as a revocation, <em>pro tanto: </em>4 Barr, 88; 4 Greenl. 341. 8 S. &amp; R. 573, turned on the fraud. As to any intent from the will of 1835, that is out of the question — this court having decided that it was not intended to pass realty. As to the presumption that the cancellation was made at the date of the will of 1835— the law does not afford it, nor would it be material. It did not operate as a republication of that day — but left the first will to operate from the day of its date: <a href="/rawle/4/0323-01" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="4 Rawle 323" data-case-ids="1823526" data-case-paths="/rawle/4/0323-01">4 Raw. 323</a>. If or is the will of 1835 a codicil, but a distinct testament: 1 Will, on Ex. 7.

    <p id="b90-5" data-blocks='[["BL_90.6",90,[380,1608,1169,292]]]'>That change of intention would be manifested by making a new will, or a revocation of the prior will might be presumed even from subsequent acts of the testator; but only from those acts which of themselves have been adjudged to afford sufficient evidence of an entire change of intention, and, therefore, constituted of themselves independent revocations.</p>

Or by marriage of testator and birth of a child, conveying away the whole of the estate, &amp;c. But none of these acts were present here, as regarded the will of 1821. So that if it was restored by the act of cancellation of the posterior will of 1824, it must remain the will of deceased.</p>

If testator lets it stand till he dies, it is his will. If he does not suffer it to do so, it is not his will.” Here he had two. He has cancelled the second. It has no effect, <a id="p91" href="#p91" data-label="91" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*91</a>no operation. It is as no will at all, being cancelled before bis death. But the former, which was never cancelled, stands as his will.” And Chief Justice McKean, in Lawson <em>v. </em>Morrisson, <a href="/us/2/0286-01" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="2 Dall. 286" data-case-ids="11746178" data-case-paths="/us/2/0286-01">2 Dall. 286</a>, following in the same track, says, that the destruction of a will, which repealed or superseded a previous one, leaves the first as if the second had not existed. This, of course, relates to a will'of real estate, as the ecclesiastical courts had jurisdiction of a will of personal estate. In these courts, a doctrine, somewhat at variance with the rule so clearly established by the Court of King’s Bench, prevailed. And it is from the ecclesiastical cases, that the argument of the learned- counsel of the plaintiff in error, seems to be drawn. But even there, it is gradually giving way, and the rule established in the common-law courts is almost, if not entirely, adopted. Thus, Sir J. Nicholls expressed 1 an opinion in Usticke <em>v. </em>Bawden, 2 Addams, 116, that where two wills are found in testator’s possession, the posterior will formally cancelled and the other not, the presumption is strongly in favour of the uncancelled will. And, in a note to Pow. on Dev. 530, Mr. Jarman says, that he was favoured by Dr. Addams with information, that the case of Usticke <em>v. </em>Bawden had been since brought to a final hearing, when the court decided in favour of the prior uncancelled will. I refer, also, to the case of Burtenshaw <em>v. </em>Gilbert, 1 Cowp. 53, and more especially to Harwood <em>v. </em>Goodright, Ib. 92, as strongly confirmatory of the rule so clearly expressed in Goodright <em>v. </em>Glazier.</p>

    <p id="b91-6" data-blocks='[["BL_91.6",91,[104,1925,1181,485]]]'>The will of 1800 could have no possible relevancy to the question at issue. The plaintiff claims to establish that the testator died intestate; that the will of 1821 was not restored by the cancellation of the will of 1824. How could an act done in 1800 anticipate time, and establish, repeal, supersede, or modify that which was made twenty years afterwards ? The death of a child or a trustee named in a will, can neither repeal, revoke, nor invalidate it. The death of Elizabeth Darrach, therefore, could have no possible effect on the will of 1821, so far as its existence and validity as a will were concerned.</p>

I will admit that if it was clearly proved that the testator, at the time he cancelled the posterior will, intended to die intestate, but had not the prior will then in his possession or power, so as to annul or destroy it, that such intent existing at the time of cancellation, and connected with it, might be given in evidence as part of the transaction or <em>res gestee; </em>just in the same' manner and for the same reason that a cancellation by accident or misadventure, such as throwing a wrong paper in the fire, obliterating the name by mistake, or accidentally throwing ink instead of sand on the paper, could be proved as explanatory of the act. But the intent and the acts evidencing it ought to be contemporaneous with the act of destruction. Because the very preservation of the prior will beyond that period, when in his possession and power, at the time he annulled the posterior one, was evidence of an intent to die testate, and keep a will in readiness to be consummated by his death. It was in fact and in law set up and restored, as if the posterior will had never existed. And it cannot be repealed or revoked by word of mouth, or subsequent circumstances and declarations, unless those circumstances amount to a revocation in law, such as marriage and birth of a child, alienation of the estate, &amp;e.: Moritz <em>v. </em>Brough, 16 S. &amp; R. 403.</p>
