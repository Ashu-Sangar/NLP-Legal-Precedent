      <em>Feb. </em>12. The plaintiff issued a <em>scire facias </em>on a mortgage given for the purchase-money of land conveyed by him to defendant, by deed with special warranty. The defendant set up a mortgage given by the former owner of the land. There was clear proof that the purchaser, at the time of her contract, knew of the existence of the mortgage; but the evidence was contradictory, whether she agreed to pay the price, notwithstanding the mortgage.</p>

      <em>Reply. </em>— Lighty <em>v. </em>Shorb was on a defect of title. Rut there can be no such thing as unknown liens — all are registered, and the purchaser has notice of them. He could never set up, that he did not know of such an objection. In the other cases there was a warranty, and the vendee must look to the security he has chosen to take.</p>

There the defect was on the .face of the title purchased by the defendant, and the maxim of <em>caveat emptor </em>entered. Equity could not interfere, because it would have been changing the terms of the bargain. This case is very different. Here Eucas sold one-third of the premises for the consideration of $3,000, the price he asked for the estate, and for which she gave her mortgage'.</p>

The encumbrance, although not paid, is a good defence: 13 S. <em>&amp; </em>R. 165. If she bought the premises for $3,000, and that was the whole consideration, she ought not to pay more than she, contracted for; and if there was more to pay than her deed called for, the plaintiff was bound to show it satisfactorily to the jury. The court fell into manifest error when they instructed the jury that the only question was, whether Mrs. Wolbert knew of the existence of the mortgage to the bank, at the time the contract was made and the deed executed. Under the evidence exhibited in the paper-book, she ought to have had the instruction of the court in her favour, and a credit for all .the payments made to the bank on their mortgage.</p>
