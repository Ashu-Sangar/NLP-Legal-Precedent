The trustee received the rents, and applied them according to the terms of trust; but,’from 1843 to 1846, the rents of the property fell short of the amount required to pay interest on the encumbrances, expenses, and the annuity, so that, <a id="p35" href="#p35" data-label="35" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*35</a>on the 1st of January, 1846, the annuity was in arrear $2,950.

      <em>“ </em>The second point, the payment of arrears, requires more consideration. The matter was submitted without argument; but the objection apparently is, that the words balance or nett revenue, income, and proceeds of the said yearly rents, issues, and profits, restrict the yearly payments of the annuity to the sum accruing year by year, and that thus the overplus of any one or more years cannot be taken to make up the deficiencies of prior years, but must be paid to the <em>cestuis que trust </em>in remainder. This view, however, is entirely too nice and technical, and it does not appear to be supported either by authority or by a sound construction of the instrument itself. It is settled in Horton <em>v. </em>Cook, <a href="/watts/10/0124-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="10 Watts 124" data-case-ids="1850945" data-case-paths="/watts/10/0124-01">10 Watts, 124</a>, that the grant of an annuity in terms out of whatever payable, <em>primá facie, </em>binds the person, and the implication from it of a covenant to pay, can be rebutted only by a plain intent apparent on the face of the instrument, that the annuitant should resort only to a specific fund. There are also numerous cases, — Swallow <em>v. </em>Swallow, 1 Beav. 432, note <em>(a); </em>Stamper <em>v. </em>Pickering, 9 Sim. 116; Green <em>v. </em>Belchier, 1 Atk. 505; 2 Story’s Eq. 1064; 2 Jarm. on Wills, 535, — where, in case of a deficiency, resort has not only been had to' all the income, but even to the principal; and where a gross sum was to be raised, Lord Eldon expressly said, that the words rents and profits did not confine the power to annual rents: Bootle <em>v. </em>Blundell, 1 Merv. 233. In a very recent case, Foster <em>v. </em>Smith, 2 T. &amp; Col. 193, there was a devise of certain estates in trust to receive the rents, &amp;c., and thereout, when and as the same grew, due and payable, to pay a clear annuity to the widow of <em>2001. </em>in quarterly payments, and immediately on the death of the widow, to convey to certain parties. The rents at first paid the annuity, afterwards there was a deficiency, and at the death of the annuitant there was a large sum in arrear, which was ordered to be made up out of the principal. It was said by Sir Knight Bruce, Y. 0., that the case would have been the same whether the rents and profits were to be considered annual, or howsoever derived from the land.<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_0_1" id="ref_footnote_0_1">(a)</a>

      <em>“ </em>Apart from these general principles, the words of the deed preclude all doubt. It is only after the annuity or yearly sum is fully paid that the other payments are to be made. This phrase is studiously repeated, and the fund for the payment of the rest of the <em>cestuis que trust, </em>is called the balance that shall then be remaining. The words annuity or yearly sum signify the whole gift or the annuity generally. The words yearly and every year are to be taken as indicating the time of payment, not as limiting the payments of the annuity to the income of each year whether great or small. There is no plain intent apparent that the annuitant should resort to the current income as a specific fund. The second payment of $25 is therefore correct also., and the arrears due to Mrs. Rudolph are to be made up in full out of the future profits after the payment of'the accruing annuity.”</p>

In that case, and in 1 Beav. 431, 1 M. &amp; K. 322, 9 Sim. 176, and 2 Y. &amp; C. Ch. 193, the deficiencies of annuities payable out of rents were ordered to be made up out of future rents. To the same effect are 10 Sim. 596, 1 S. &amp; St. 463, 2 Vin. Abr. tit. <em>Annuity, </em>508. Even where the fund fails, if there is a clear intent to give a certain annuity at all-events, it must be made up out of the residue: Milne <em>v. </em>Milne, 1 Ves. 106; 5 Russ. <a id="p37" href="#p37" data-label="37" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*37</a>24; so where the fund set apart turns out to be inadequate by a reduction of government securities: 1 Russ. 370; 10 Sim. 596. There the court considered the charge to be on the <em>corpus </em>of the estate, and to be made up out of it, notwithstanding the words, payable out of rents and profits. So it is wherever the annuitant is a purchaser, as she is here, by relinquishing her dower, &amp;c.: <a href="/sc-eq/11/0018-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Hill Eq. 15" data-case-ids="1833094" data-case-paths="/sc-eq/11/0018-01">2 Hill, Ch. 15</a>; 2 P.

Certainly he never designed to charge the <em>corpus </em>of the estate to the entire disinherison of his heirs and children. The language shows this — it was payable out of the profits, and if these fell short, the parties entitled to them bear the loss. •</p>
