It is plainly not a case within the act of 1836. The act of 1840 confers jurisdiction in cases of actual fraud, accident, mistake, or account; none of these apply. Nor does the still further extended jurisdiction, under the act of 1845, include it. Beside, that was passed after the bill was filed; it has no retrospective operation: 4 S. &amp; R. 401. But, should that act apply, here is no case of constructive fraud, within the definitions in the books: Stor. Eq. § 258. It is a case between principal and surety, and equity never interferes there: Ib. 323-8, 495-9. There is no case to be found where the court compelled a principal to repay a surety the debt paid by the former. The remedy is by assumpsit, and in such cases the court does not interfere, but leaves the party to his remedy at law. The other ground is discovery. But bills of that sort are not allowed by the acts of Assembly, but in two cases; one in aid of an action pending in the same court; the other in aid of the execution after judgment recovered. But no court in this commonwealth can entertain an original bill of discovery, seeking relief in the same court. It is not necessary; for had there been an action at law, all the discovery now obtained would have been obtained equally well by a bill in aid of that action. Courts of equity will not retain a bill if the discovery be the only ground of jurisdiction, and is sought unnecessarily. 2. When the money was borrowed the corporation did not exist. When subsequently created, the members of the association remained liable. A change of the liability to that of the corporation, could only be made with their assent and that of the debtor: <a href="/citations/?q=2%20R.%20359" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="2 R. 359">2 R. 359</a>.

This, argument applies in all cases between principal and surety, where the relation of surety-ship does not appear in the instrument creating the debt. A discovery was also necessary in this instance, to establish the substantial identity of the present corporation with the original association, and to show that the property held in trust for the latter had been conveyed to the former, and a discovery going to the foundation of the right of suit, will give equity jurisdiction: <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Cow.%20728" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="4 Cow. 728">4 Cow. 728</a>.

Having become its own trustee by their conveyance to it as-a corporation, it was bound to do whatever they were bound to do; and, having received the title to the whole property, legal as well as beneficial, it had it burthened with the equities which had before been attached to it. That the promise was originally made by a society irresponsible at law, would be an answer to an action at law, but certainly not to a bill in equity, after it had acquired a corporate existence, as a person with capacity to sue and be sued.</p>

      <em>The </em>fraud is, in <em>the </em>first place, the defendants’ breach of confidence, in neglecting to redeem the property pledged for their debt, as they were in conscience bound to do; and, in the second, their refusal, for defect of legal remedy, to compensate a loss which every principle of common honesty casts upon them. ' To leave a surety in the lurch, because there is no legal obligation resting on the principal, if not an actual fraud, is certainly, at the very least, a constructive one. I say a legal obligation, or a legal remedy against him ; for the remedy, by the equitable action of assumpsit, which, in such a case, was formerly held to lie with us, and would perhaps still lie, was a clumsy and inefficient one. It was, in truth, a bill in equity in the guise of an action at law, which afforded none of the facilities for the discovery of truth which are afforded by the remedy in a different form; and.that consideration alone would be sufficient to sustain the jurisdiction elsewhere. And even here, I will not say that the present case is not within the true meaning of the act of 1836, which gives <em>“ </em>specific relief, where a recovery in damages would be an inadequate remedy.” But the jurisdiction stands on a more solid foundation. It is established by the cases cited in the argument, that an extension of remedy at <a id="p280" href="#p280" data-label="280" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*280</a>law, does not supplant the relief that was to be obtained in equity. Why, then, should this tort between parties who stand in no privity to each other, be turned into a contract ? Certainly not because the courts were at one time compelled by defect of remedy to do so. The equitable jurisdiction conferred by these statutes is a valuable — indeed, an indispensable one; and it ought to be extended by every interpretation of which the words are susceptible. If there is any case in which it is the part of a good judge to amplify his jurisdiction, this is that case. The property of the complainants has been sacrificed to pay the debt of another, which grew out of a transaction to which they are strangers; and they come into a court of equity to claim its assistance in obtaining a clue to the facts and circumstances'of it, as well as a knowledge of their rights. Are they not entitled to it ? True, an execution against an insolvent corporation, on a judgment at law, may be followed by the appointment of a sequestrator, and a bill by him for a discovery of effects; but that is no equivalent for the extraordinary powers of a chancellor, in bringing to light the circumstances of a hidden transaction, on which a party founds his right to recover. These complainants, therefore, were entitled to a discovery in the first instance. It is no objection to this interpretation, ' that the statute which gives equitable jurisdiction of constructive frauds, was enacted after the complainants had filed their bill. The cases cited on the argument show, that the courts do not incline against a retroactive operation, not on the right, but on the remedy; and more especially where they have a discretionary power over the costs.</p>

But to enforce it by attachment, would break down the provision for distribution among creditors. At the outset, however, that act speaks of “ <em>all </em>executions which shall be issued from any court <em>of record;” </em>and our courts of law, when sitting in equity, are still such. It is true, a succeeding section speaks of executions on judgments; but a decree in equity, though not within the letter of the enactment, is within the spirit, and, consequently, within the true intent and meaning of it. If, then, an execution, in the common-law form, may be sued out to enforce a <a id="p281" href="#p281" data-label="281" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*281</a>decree for the payment of money, the benefit of equitable jurisdiction, in the first instance, may be preserved without impinging on any statutory provision whatever. The plaintiff may prosecute his right by bill; he may sue out execution on his decree; and he may have a sequestrator, who may file a bill for the discovery of effects, and distribute the fund just as if the right to recover had been established by a judgment at law. Now, it fortunately happens, that we have statute provisions for suing out executions on decrees for the payment of money, not only by the Orphans’ Court, but by the court below. By the 39th section of the revised act of 1832, a decree of the Orphans’ Court may be enforced By attachment or sequestration; or a decree for money against a party who appeared, by execution in the nature of a <em>fieri facias; to </em>which the act of 1846 added a <em>venditioni exponas, </em>with a right to issue <em>testatum </em>writs to any other county. So far the powers of the Orphans’ Court. By the act of 1845, to allow and regulate appeals in equity, from the Common Pleas of Philadelphia county to the Supreme Court, it is directed, that “if an appeal be made from any order or decree of the said Court of Common Pleas, in equity, for the payment of money, such appeal shall not stay the issuing Of execution, or other process, to enforce the decree, or any proceeding thereon, unless, &amp;c.” Nor is it of account, that the power has not been granted in terms. ■ In Maryland, lands were sold on execution by no .other authority than a forced construction of the <em>5 </em>G. <em>2, </em>c. 7, which was understood in that state, to which it was extended in practice, to put them on ■the footing of chattels; and their l^w, I believe, continues so still, though it appears in Griffith’s Law Register, vol. 4, p. 913, that their equitable estates were subjected to execution, by a statute enacted in 1810. Our statute requires no such construction; for the power to enforce a decree for money by execution, is expressly sanctioned, if it is not enjoined, by it. Nor is the merit of the proceeding due to Pennsylvania. It may be seen, by turning to Griffith’s Register, that it was used, in his day, by the courts in all the states which had a separate administration of equity, except Delaware ; and it is not to be presumed that its utility and convenience in practice, had escaped the notice of our legislature. In Bevan <em>v. </em>Dingman’s-Choice Turnpike, decided at this term, <em>antè </em>174, which has been thought to stand in the way of the jurisdiction, the point decided was, that a bill for the discovery of effects, pursuant to an execution against an' insolvent corporation, must be filed, not by the plaintiff in the judgment, but by the sequestrator. The prayer <a id="p282" href="#p282" data-label="282" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*282</a>in the present bill, is not for the discovery and distribution of effects at all, but for a decree of recovery, and a discovery of facts and circumstances to found it. That obtained, the complainants have their execution by <em>fieri faeias, </em>with its apparatus of sequestrator, bill of discovery, and distribution of effects, insisted on in the case to which the appellants have referred; and it will be seen from this, that it is not an authority for them.</p>
