When I contracted with you for your ore, you were delivering at tbe furnace good rock ore, that was worth tbe price I agreed to pay you, and tbe ore we was to get was to be <a id="p484" href="#p484" data-label="484" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*484</a>as good and productive ore as that was. All the ore we have received, since the 1st of April last, is of an inferior sort, mostly screening of a very poor quality; at least the one-fourth of it is clay and soap-stone; there is scarcely one piece of the whole that is not mixed, more or less, with this yellow ocherish stone, like soap-stone, which renders it very unproductive; so much so, that it takes from three to four tons of your ore to make a ton of pig metal. We have frequently screened loads of your ore, and never found one of them that there was less than four and six large barrows full of dirt in, besides the soap-stone, which was not taken out and separated from the ore. I consider that you have violated our agreement by not cleaning the ore from clay and other foreign matter, which you promised in the agreement to do; and I hereby notify you, that hereafter I will not receive any more of your ore on any other terms than such as I conceive fair and just, and which I know of no other away of arriving at than to dock it to make it good. There is at least a half ton weight in every load of your ore, that is not ore, nor anything like ore, besides a great deal of matter that is nothing more than a miserable mixture of ore and other matter. I can abide the contract in no other way than by making your ore good by taking off all other matter from it in the process of docking, which I will endeavour to do as nearly right as possible; and if you think that you can stand the process of dockage of the ore you have hauled since the 1st of April, as well as that which you may haul hereafter, you may continue to haul; but I am determined to pay hereafter for nothing but the pure iron ore, either hauling, raising, or leave, and wish you to govern yourself accordingly; and if you cannot comply with your contract, and clean your ore from sand, clay, flint, stone, and other foreign matter, as you have engaged to do, then I want none of it, only for what it is worth, of which I myself am the best judge.”</p>

A witness for the plaintiff said, that the agent assigned no other reason.for his conduct, than the instructions of the defendants. The .agent himself testified, that he had instructions from the defendants not to weigh any more ore for plaintiff, unless he agreed to clean it, according to his contract; that he told him so when the ore was tendered and refused. He further said, that one of the defendants gave him “ the instructions on the 18th of August. He showed me the letter.”</p>

J., instructed the jury, that contracts are to <a id="p485" href="#p485" data-label="485" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*485</a>receive such reasonable construction as will accomplish the intention of the parties, and-the whole is to be read together; “that as the defendants were 'bound to furnish such ‘ tools, screens, ropes, and other implements’ as should be necessary to work the bank with; so that, in promising properly to clean the ore of all clay, sand, stone, &amp;c., the plaintiff promised to make diligent and skilful use of the ‘ tools, screens, ropes, and other implements,’ which should be furnished him by the defendants; and was bound to use the same' degree of diligence and skill which men engaged in similar business ordinarily employ. To, clean the ore ‘ properly,’ was to clean it as completely as usual diligence and skill, employing such implements as defendants had furnished, could do. The ore might, or might not, .be absolutely clean of clay, sand, stone, and other impurities. If the defendants furnished implements which, with diligent and skilful use, would enable the plaintiff to extract from the bank what Mr. Campbell’s letter called for, ‘the pure iron ore,’ the plaintiff was bound by the tenor of his contract to furnish it; but if they did not, they had no right to exact from the plaintiff the pure iron ore. It is said, that iron ore is never expected to go to the furnace absolutely pure, and it is not probable that these parties contemplated any departure from the customary practice. <em>Properly </em>cleansed, may mean fitted for making iron— reduced to the pure ore — or, it may mean, cleaned as iron ore is usually cleaned, before it is hauled to the furnace; but in this contract, this expression must be interpreted with reference to the facilities which the defendants bound themselves to furnish, and implies that degree of cleansing which reasonable skill and diligence, combined with these facilities, were capable of producing. Now, the question is for the jury, whether the plaintiff used such skill and diligence. If all the, evidence satisfies them that he did; that he prepared the ore as well as he reasonably could with such means as were furnished him, we must, for the purposes of this action, consider the ore ‘properly cleaned of all clay, sand, stone, &amp;c.,’ and hold the plaintiff to have performed his agreement in the particular in which alone failure has been imputed to him by the defendants.</p>

The conduct of the clerk, in refusing to weigh the last load of the ore, was in pursuance of one of the defendant’s instructions, and this letter having been read to the clerk, and then sent to the plaintiff, we are to presume that the communications on which they intended the plain<a id="p486" href="#p486" data-label="486" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*486</a>tiff to act, are contained in the letter, rather than in the conversation which Gifford had with him. The letter, like the contract, is for the court to construe, and, taking it as a whole, without laying undue emphasis on any particular expression or sentence, we have -no hesitation in pronouncing it a refusal further to execute the contract of 1st November, 1845 — a repudiation of that agreement— and a proposition to substitute for it new and inconsistent conditions. The contract specifies the terms on which defendants were to receive and pay for the. plaintiff’s ore; the letter informs him that ‘hereafter I will not receive any more of your .ore on any other terms than such as I conceive'fair and just;’ the contract gives the defendants no right of dockage; the letter tells the plaintiff, plainly, that, they have assumed this right, ‘and if you think that you can stand the process of dockage of the ore you have hauled since the 1st of April, as well as that which you may haul hereafter, you may continue to haul.’ The contract contemplated the delivery of ore <em>properly cleaned, </em>which, as we have already seen, might, or might not, be absolutely clean ‘ore; the letter demands ‘nothing but the pure iron ore.’</p>

He did so regard it. He carried no more ore, but instituted this action for damages.”</p>

There was conflicting testimony as to the reasons assigned by the agent for not receiving the ore, and yet the judge, as matter of law, directs the jury to assume that he was referring to the letter to plaintiff, rather than his verbal instructions, when he did so refuse.
