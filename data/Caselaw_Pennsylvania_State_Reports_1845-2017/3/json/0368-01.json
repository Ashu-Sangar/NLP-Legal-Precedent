His situation does not appear to us to be distinguished from that of a sheriff or prothonotary,. who has money in his hands as a public officer; and it has been determined that these are not liable to the process of attachment. Great public inconvenience would ensue, if money could be thus arrested in the hands of officers, and they be made liable to all the delay, embarrassment, and trouble that would ensue, from being stopped in the routine of their business, compelled to appear in court, employ counsel, and answer interrogatories, as well as take care that the proceedings are regularly carried on, and bail to return duly given. If a precedent of this kind were set, there seems no reason why the state or county treasurers, or other fiscal officers of the Commonwealth, or of municipal bodies, may not be subjected to the levying of attachments, which has never been attempted nor supposed to come within the attachment law. We do not, therefore, think this is such a debt as is contemplated by that law.\nThe judgment is affirmed.",

That the said garnishee, at the time of the service of the writ aforesaid, had not.any money in his hands, due and owing to the defendants, or either of them, except as aforesaid.\nIt was agreed by and between the parties, that the answers of the garnishee to the interrogatories of the plaintiff, were the facts of the case, and should be considered by the court as a case stated, subject to a writ of error by either party.
