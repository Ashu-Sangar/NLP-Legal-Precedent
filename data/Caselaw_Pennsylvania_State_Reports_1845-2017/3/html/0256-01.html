The deed to be made by Hix, when the $75 were paid, but to be retained by him until the whole purchase money was paid.

Several small payments were afterwards made by James McGill; but at no one time did he make the full payment required by the agreement. James McGill continued to reside on the premises, until October, 1829, when he died, leaving a widow and four children all in their minority. Mrs. McGill, with her family, remained in the undisturbed possession of the property, until the latter part of the year 1834; when Hix instituted an action of ejectment against her, to enforce the payment of the unpaid purchase money. That ejectment was tried at April Term, 1838, and involved the question of the amount of purchase money due and unpaid. A verdict was rendered for the plaintiff, to be released on the payment of $110 72, if paid before the first of April, 1837. Mrs. McGill with her two youngest children continued in possession until the spring of 1838; when, upon being told by Hix, that he would turn her out if she did not leave, she gave up the possession. The amount due, as fixed by the verdict, or any part of it, was not paid. Hix then took possession and remained in possession until the spring of 1841, when he sold to John Heft, who went into, possession. Heft was to pay $300, and was to have a bond of indemnity against the claim of'the McGills with bail. In July, 1842, Heft had paid $92, and made some considerable improvements on the premises,' which he had rented to Jacob Heft, one of the defendants. In March, 1841, Jeremiah McGill, one of the sons of James McGill, deceased, tendered to Conrad Hix the sum of $125, and said he wanted his land back again. Hix refused to take the money, saying the least he would take was $300. The matter remained in this situation, until January Term, 1843, to which this ejectment was brought by the four children of James McGill, deceased, one of whom, Andrew, was then of full age, and the others minors, suing by a next friend.

The defendants objected; but the court overruled* the objection, and sealed a bill of exceptions, which was defendants’ first bill of exceptions.

The defendants still objected to her competency, on the ground of interest; whereupon the court overruled the objection, and admitted the witness to testify. This was defendants’ second bill of exception.

This is an equitable claim ; and as the legal title is in the defendants, it was necessary for the plaintiffs to prove, that they tendered, before the suit was brought, the balance due on the contract. Have they done so ? If the evidence can be relied on, they did offer to Conrad Hix, one of the defendants, $125. Was that all that was due on the contract, including interest ? If it was, and they now have in court, and ready for the defendant, the amount due and interest, there is nothing in the way of a recovery by the plaintiffs, so far as Conrad Hix is concerned.

The jury will ascertain from all the evidence, the amount due on the contract, with the interest; and in doing so, they may deduct from the price agreed on for the land, a reasonable rent for the premises, from the time the defendants came into possession. In fixing on this rent, they should take from the annual value of the land, all taxes and such necessary repairs as are really necessary for the fair enjoyment of the premises, whether it be in repairing of fences and buildings, liming the land, &amp;c. But new buildings or improvements not necessary for the fair and reasonable enjoyment of the premises, should not be taken into consideration by the jury. If Heft has put up buildings, not necessary for such fair and reasonable enjoyment of the premises, when he knew of the equitable claim of the plaintiffs, he did it with his eyes open, and it is a matter exclusively between himself and Conrad Hix, from whom he purchased : we believe the rule here indicated to be the correct one, in a case like the present; were it not so, a person might be improved out of his land; <a id="p261" href="#p261" data-label="261" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*261</a>or improvements might be made upon the land of such value that he could not pay them, or of a kind that they would be of no use to him; and he would, perhaps, be compelled to give up his land, if he were compelled to pay the value of the improvements, before he could obtain possession of them.

The record of the suit of Conrad Hix <em>v. </em>Elizabeth McGill, the widow, was not evidence in this action. The plaintiffs in this suit were neither parties nor privies to that. They do not claim through Elizabeth, the defendant in that suit, and they cannot be prejudiced by any act of her’s. She had no interest in this suit, and would have been a competent witness, without a release.- 20 Eng. Com. Law Rep. 420. The courts have encouraged the practice of minors suing by their next friend. But if minors could not thus sue, it can only be taken advantage of by plea in abatement. <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Johns.%20Rep.%20372" class="citation" data-index="5" data-cite="7 Johns.

It required a regular proceeding at law to divest them. The lot was vacant when McGill purchased. He had paid all the purchase money, except about fifty dollars, taken possession, and built a house and barn, and died seised.</p>
    <p id="b261-4" data-blocks='[["BL_261.8",261,[148,1390,1183,237]]]'>Hix brought an ejectment against the widow, and obtained a conditional judgment. He threatened to turn the widow out, and she left the premises. The children of McGill were not parties to that ejectment. It was not evidence against them, and when offered in evidence by Hix it was properly rejected.</p>
    <p id="b261-5" data-blocks='[["BL_261.9",261,[143,1632,1190,623]]]'>The alienation of an improvement right by the widow, after the death of her husband leaving an infant two years old, will not bar the right of the infant to recover the land wdien it arrives at full age; even if the consideration received by the widow should have been applied to the support and maintenance of the child. Senser <em>v. </em>Bower and Wife, 1 Penna. Rep. 450. If the children of McGill were wrongfully dispossessed, they had a right to regain the possession without a tender of the balance due on the purchase by the father. But a tender of more than the amount due was made before the ejectment brought. Hix rejected the tender, and demanded three hundred dollars. The whole evidence shows, that Hix was rapacious; and that he desired to dispossess the widow and her children, and regain the possession of the premises.</p>
    <p id="b261-6" data-blocks='[["BL_261.10",261,[144,2262,1183,138]]]'>More than the balance due on the article was brought into court on the trial. Why then should the plaintiffs not recover ? They had the justice of the case on their side.</p>

The children of McGill were improperly dispossessed. Hix had no right to obtain the possession of the house and lot in the manner he pursued. It was clearly an equitable set-off against the balance due by the plaintiffs in error, on the purchase of their ancestor.</p>
    <p id="b262-4" data-blocks='[["BL_262.4",262,[301,703,1184,670]]]'>It is further contended, that the infant children of McGill should have had a guardian appointed, and that they cannot maintain this ejectment by their next friend. It was held in Turner <em>v. </em>Patridge, 3 Penna. Rep. 173, that an infant may sue by his next friend, appointed at the common law by the court in which the action is pending ; and by our practice, without any appointment at all, in order to supply the want of capacity in the infant, to afford in his own person a party responsible on the record for the costs. But as the execution of the trust is under the supervision and control of the court, there is no reason why our practice of constituting a <em>prochein ami, </em>without the express sanction of the court, should be disturbed. Such a next friend is in the nature of a guardian <em>ad litim,; </em>the chief difference being, that the former is curator of an infant plaintiff, and the latter of an infant defendant. 1 Tidd’s Practice, 69.</p>
