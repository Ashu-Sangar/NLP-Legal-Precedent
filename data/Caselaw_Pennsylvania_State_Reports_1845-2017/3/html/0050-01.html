The evidence showed, that Mr. Alexander purchased the potatoes from a person on board a canal boat, at Northumberland, and paid ten dollars on the bargain; that when the boat came to Lewistown, where Alexander resided, the person from whom he bought was not on board, and that the defendants, <em>admitting they were present when </em>

      <em>Mr. A. bought, </em>claimed the potatoes themselves, by virtue of a prior sale to them by Mr. A.’s vendor, of which sale they did not think it was their business to give him notice. There was no evidence as to how or when the quantity of the potatoes was to be ascertained, as between Mr. Alexander and his vendor, other than an admission of Mr. A. that he was to give 62J or 65 cents per bushel for them delivered at Lewistown. Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff.</p>

For instance, the want of direction, assigned in the first error, is supplied at the conclusion of the charge; and the same thing, perhaps, maybe said of other errors. The judge is charged, in some of the exceptions, with having misstated the evidence; but it is not error in law to do so, the remedy being a motion for a new trial. Nor are mere errors of omission, without a prayer for specific direction, assignable. Most of the exceptions fall under the one or the other of these heads. The direction actually given, generally affirmed the defendant’s legal positions. They, however, disaffirmed one of them, and properly ; for it is not law, that the right of property could not pass, so long as the quantity of the thing sold remained to be ascertained; as was decided in Scott <em>v. </em>Wells, <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Watts%20%26%20Serg.%20368" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 368">6 Watts &amp; Serg. 368</a>.
