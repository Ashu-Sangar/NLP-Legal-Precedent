Where a survey is bounded nearly all around by lines of older surveys made on the ground, and well marked, it would be a valid survey although not marked on the ground, if returned into the land-office. In the present case,' however, if the jury believe that this survey of «William Benson’ has no marks applicable to it but the adjoining surveys of 1773 on the northern side, and that there is no line or corner of these adjoining surveys which correspond with the official draft of William Bensqn except on the northern side of the survey, and that these older surveys interfere with the return of «William Benson,’ so as not to allow him land enough in that direction, then the court instruct you that although it would not be necessary for the deputy surveyor to go on the ground to re-mark the lines of the old surveys, or the division lines of the new«, yet the finding of the lines of 1773 on the ground is not sufficient to establish the survey of «William Benéon,’ if you- believe no survey was made on the ground.</blockquote>

The ninth section of the act of the 8th April, 1785, has ever been held declaratory of the common law.. It is in conformity with the instruction to the deputy-surveyor, as well before as since the Revolution, that’a survey of a warrant was necessary by the deputy,after the warrant comes to his hands. -This I take to be solemnly determined by this court in Martin <em>v. </em>Smith, <a href="/citations/?q=1%20Rawle%20404" class="citation" data-index="12" data-cite="1 Rawle 404">1 Rawle, 404</a>. By analogy to the statute of limitations, a survey purporting to be-made and returned for twenty-one years, without- any adverse claim to the land, is presumed to be rightly made on the ground. . It becomes a presumption of law, like livery of seisin, and is now the settled law. I need only refer to Mock <em>v. </em>Astley, Caul <em>v. </em>Spring, and Lambourn <em>v. </em>Hartswick, as leading cases. The period of time between the survey of Benson and the survey of Thomas, which called for an improvement, is that of this period. We’ cannot say the instruction of the judge was wrong on this point of the case.</p>
