      <em>July </em>11. This was an action on the case for the loss of horses &amp;c., in crossing a ferry. The plaintiff declared against A. Smith, as owner and occupier, and E. Smith being in his employ for conducting said ferry: ««for that they, the said defendants, respectively occupying and conducting said ferry, offered and undertook, in consideration that the public, and those desirous of travelling across said river should be conveyed across by means of the ferriage of said defendants, and for hire to receive and safely to convey across said river, by a certain ferry boat, across, &amp;c; and also all wagons, &amp;c; and having thus offered and undertaken, did use, occupy, and conduct said ferry; that plaintiff learning said defendants did so use and occupy, and had offered and undertaken safely to transport, &amp;c.,” brought certain horses, and a wagon of the value, &amp;c., together with goods in. the care of L. O. to said ferry. That said horses, &amp;c., being on said track, E. Smith, at the instance, and in the employ of A. Smith, did agree safely to receive and convey, and that plaintiff in consideration of such undertaking committed said property to the care of said defendants. That defendants contriving, <em>See., </em>did not safely convey, but through their carelessness said goods, &amp;c., were thrown into the river and lost.</p>

The plea was not guilty. The evidence showed, according to the finding of the jury, though there was conflicting testimony whether the negligence of the wagoner was the cause of the accident, that there was no fall board at the end of the flat used as a ferry boat, and it being insecurely fastened to the shore, the wheels of the wagon striking the side of the boat, as it was being driven on board under the direction of the ferryman, the flat was shoved from the shore, and the horses fell into the river and were drowned, the harness injured, and a whip and robe lost.</p>

That a ferryman was a common carrier, and was responsible for all losses except those occasioned by the act of God, inevitable accident, or the public enemies. If a fastening was necessary, he was bound to have it, and if it broke he was liable though he thought it sufficient.</p>

That this is so, is shown from the fact that no single requisite to a declaration in contract is wanting. In McCall <em>v. </em>Forsyth, <a href="/watts-serg/4/0179-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Watts &amp; Serg. 179" data-case-ids="1856539" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/4/0179-01">4 Watts &amp;Serg. 179</a>, there is no resemblance to <a id="p344" href="#p344" data-label="344" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*344</a>this declaration, and it was decided to be in case. In Ansell <em>v. </em>Water-house, 18 E. C. L. R. 227, the C. J. said he could see no words of contract in the case, which certainly cannot be said here; and in Brellenton <em>v. </em>Wood, 7 E. C.

Dennison says, “In the old form it is <em>suscepit, Sec., </em>which shows it is <em>ex </em>contractu.” The only question in Church <em>v. </em>Munford, cited by defendant, was whether the two counts were substantially the same. Under an allegation of negligence in the driver, who was hired by the witness, he was interested to defeat our defence, by throwing the blame on defendants, and was therefore incompetent without a release. That he was liable, is decided in Henning <em>v. </em>English, 25 E. C. L. R. 533; Schuylkill <em>v. </em>Harris, 5 Watts &amp; Serg.; Myre <em>v. </em>Ludwig, 1 Barr, 47.</p>

Here the misfeasance was distinctly put in issue and canvassed in the court below; and there must be a clear violation of some rule of pleading to reverse a judgment under such circumstances. All actions against carriers are directly on the contract or for a tort founded in fact on, or deducible from a contract, for <em>wanton </em>injuries rarely occur; a declaration must therefore be tinctured with contract. Church <em>v. </em>Munford, <a href="/johns/11/0479-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="11 Johns. 479" data-case-ids="2137738" data-case-paths="/johns/11/0479-01">11 Johns. 479</a>; Zell <em>v. </em>Arnold, 2 Penna.

    <p id="b343-4" data-blocks='[["BL_343.4",343,[153,564,1193,1648]]]'>The motion to arrest the judgment for the reason that the verdict was against but one of the defendants, was properly dismissed, the declaration being for a tort, which is both joint and several. It was orginally the practice to declare against a carrier only on the custom of the realm; but it has long been established that the plaintiff may declare in case or assumpsit at his election; and it is usual to declare in the latter, as was done in McCahan <em>v. </em>Hurst, <a href="/watts/7/0175-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="7 Watts 175" data-case-ids="1846822" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0175-01">7 Watts, 175</a>, Todd <em>v. </em>Figley, Ibid. 524, and Hunt <em>v. </em>Wynn, <a href="/watts/6/0047-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="6 Watts 47" data-case-ids="1846101" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0047-01">6 Watts, 47</a>. Indeed, his right to do so seems never to have been questioned by the English courts. On the contrary, the judges in Powell <em>v. </em>Layton, 2 N. R. 356, and Dale <em>v. </em>Hall, 1 Wils. 282, thought that the declaration is essentially founded in contract, though the word <em>suscepit </em>be not in it. In Powell <em>v. </em>Layton, the defendant was allowed to plead the non-joinder of his partner in abatement, though the word duty stood in place of the word <em>promise; </em>in which the court seems to have gone very far, inasmuch as the’ plaintiff may certainly waive the contract and go for a tort. There has been a good deal of wavering on the subject, not only as to the proper remedy, but as to \he distinctive feature of the declaration. In regard to the latter, Corbett <em>v. </em>Packington, 6 Barn. &amp; Cres. 268, has put the law of the subject on satisfactory ground, by making the presence or absence of an averment, not of promise only, but of consideration also, the criterion; for it is impossible to conceive of a promise without consideration, any more than a consideration without promise, as an available cause of action; and when a consideration is not laid, the word <em>agreed, </em>or <em>undertook, </em>or even the more formal word <em>promised, </em>must be treated as no more than inducement to the duty imposed by the common law. Now no consideration is laid in the count before us. The undertaking of the .defendants to safely pass the team, is stated to be the consideration which moved the wagoner to commit it to their care; but no consideration is stated for any thing else: certainly, none for the defendant’s undertaking. As the declaration, therefore, is decisively in case, the verdict against one of the defendants and for the other, is consequently good.</p>
