The note was not included in the inventory filed. It was proved before the auditor, that Daniel Beckley, jun., was engaged in the mercantile business in Union county, for a number of years; that he was the owner of real estate, considered to be worth $2500; and that his circumstances were reputed to be good until the summer of 1842, when he failed in business, and the proceeds of his property did not reach to pay the one-fourth part of his liabilities.</p>

They cannot force him to charge himself with the amount of the note in his account; nor can one administrator be compelled to pay the personal debt of his co-administrator to the estate.

This is not the case of creditors seeking to charge an administrator. Daniel had eight years to pay the note. John eould not collect the' note until it was due. After it was due, the heirs, all of whom were of age, took no steps to collect it. How could John collect it?

The settled rule of law in relation to liability, is different between executors who gave no bail, and administrators who do. Administrators are responsible for each other. Here there was a joint bond, and joint administration. John Beckley was a trustee for the heirs, and was bound to use diligence and fidelity in the execution of his trust.</p>

It was assets in the hands of his colleague, who was solvent at the date of the bond; and as it was not applied by him, all, including the sureties, are answerable for it. Had he been insolvent, the appellant would not have been bound for a debt; which, as to him, w'ould not have been assets; but it is conceded that the insolvency did not occur for several years. Why, then, should not the appellant be bound to account for-his colleague in the Orphans’ <a id="p428" href="#p428" data-label="428" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*428</a>Qourt ? The result must be the same; and it is attended with less expense to the accountant, as well as less delay to the parties entitled. For this reason, it is, perhaps, that the practice is to charge an administrator, in his account, with every thing for which he would eventually be bound. <em>' </em>Decree affirmed.</p>
