On the 8th of December, 1845, it was submitted by consent, in open court, to referees, &amp;c., on whose award, or that of a majority, judgment was to be entered by the prothonotary, without exception or appeal. The referees filed their award on the 20th day of May, 1843, finding in favour of the defendant, on which the prothonotary entered judgment.

That the set-off was the only point apparently in controversy, and having allowed it in favour of the defendant, we made up our award in his favour. That after this <a id="p457" href="#p457" data-label="457" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*457</a>was done, but before it was lifted, our attention, that is, the attention of two of the arbitrators, was directed to the fact of their being still a small balance in favour of the plaintiff; and that we had determined to examine the matter and change the award accordingly, but found that it had been lifted without the consent of a majority of the board. The arbitrator in whose possession it was left, not knowing these facts, gave up the award. In view of these facts, we therefore ask the court to direct, that the award shall be referred back to the same arbitrators, for the correction of this</p>
