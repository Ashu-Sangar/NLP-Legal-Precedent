      <em>June </em>15. Benjamin Moser, for the use of Lewis H. Shitler, brought a suit against Solomon Hoch, before a justice of the peace, and recovered a judgment for $50. From this, the defendant appealed, and the cause being arbitrated, an award was made in favour of the plaintiff for the same sum. Hoch, the defendant, then, on leave given, paid the debt, interest and costs, into court. After the above proceedings had taken place, Daniel Engle applied to the court for-a rule to show cause why the judgment should not be marked for his use, and filed the following affidavit as the ground of his application.</p>

Subsequently to said- Benjamin Moser’s obtaining the horse, as above stated, he, the said Benjamin Moser, sold or swopped the horse to Lewis H. Shitler, (above named;) the said Lewis H. Shitler, after getting the horse from Benjamin Moser, as above mentioned, assigned the said horse to this deponent.for a valuable consideration, as per assignment, a, copy of which is annexed to this affidavit; that, in pursuance of said assignment, the said horse was delivered to this deponent; the clock mentioned in said assignment being in this deponent’s possession before said assignment was executed; while the said horse was in this deponent’s possession, or in the possession of Samuel Fix, to whom this deponent had hired him, Daniel Strawn, of the city of Philadelphia, came to Reading and claimed the horse as his property, averring that he had ■ been stolen from him by.the person from whom said Solomon Hoch had purchased him; the said horse was therefore, with the consent of the said Lewis H. Shitler and this deponent, delivered to said Daniel Strawn, who paid said Lewis H. Shitler five dollars as a consideration for said horse being given up to him without putting him to the trouble and expense of proving his ownership ; the said Lewis H. Shitler has taken the benefit <em>bf </em>the bankrupt law and is insolvent, and no money can be recovered from him; the debt for - which the said horse and other articles were assigned to this deponent, still remains due and unpaid, except that said Lewis H. Shitler gave to this deponent an order on Mr. Hetzel for $20, on which said Hetzel paid $19 25, saying he was not bound to pay any more ; and this deponent yet has in his possession the clock mentioned in said assignment, which clock may be worth from $20 to $25 ; the amount now actually due this deponent from said Lewis H. Shitler, as hereinbefore set forth, exceeds the amount of the award in this case.</p>

Moser got judgment against Hoch for the use of Shitler ; and Engle procured the court to strike out Shitler’s name and insert his own in the place of it. But what recourse could Engle have against any one but Shitler, with whom alone he stood in privily? He could not get round him merely because he was insolvent, and stood between him and the earlier parties; and if he could not have recourse to them directly by action, he cannot have recourse to them indirectly by having a judgment to which he has no title, marked to his use. On what ground Moser recovered it before he was damnified, and why it was marked to the use of Shitler we know not; nor is it material to inquire, as <a id="p233" href="#p233" data-label="233" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*233</a>it is enough to know that Engle had no claim to it. As his affidavit is agreed to be considered as a case stated, we must take the facts contained in it to be true; but we see nothing in it- to warrant the order of the court.</p>
