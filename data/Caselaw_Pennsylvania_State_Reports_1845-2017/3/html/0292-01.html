      <em>Jime </em>24. This was an action of debt brought by Michael Beckley, assignee of Isaac Beckley, the plaintiff in error, against Nicholas Eckert, on a covenant of guaranty written on the back of a bond and executed by the defendant for the payment of the said bond. On the trial, the plaintiff gave in evidence a bond, dated 19th of August, 1842, given by Jacob L. Eckert to Isaac Beckley, for the payment of $400, on the 1st of April, 1843. It appeared, that on the 24th of August, 1842, the defendant guarantied the payment of this bond by the following contract: “ I, Nicholas Eckert, do hereby guaranty the payment of the within bond, together with all interest which may become due thereon. Witness my hand and seal this 24th day of August, a. i). 1842. Nicholas Eckert, [l. s.]”</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b290-9" data-blocks='[["BL_290.9",290,[277,1467,1184,287]]]'>On the 20th of October, 1843, Isaac Beckley assigned this bond, under his hand and seal, and in the presence of two -witnesses, to Michael Beckley. It also appeared that Jacob L. Eckert, the obligor in the bond, made an assignment in trust for the benefit of creditors in March, 1843. The only question raised here was, whether the plaintiff could recover on the guaranty, in his present form of action.</p>

McDoal <em>v. </em>Yeomans, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20362" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Watts 362">8 Watts, 362</a>. Simply as a guaranty, it was within the act of 28th of May, 1715, inasmuch as the insolvency of the obligor in the bond, the principal debtor, had occurred before the assignment. The guarantee had an immediate right of action, and the guarantor was fixed for the amount of the bond. His obligation or covenant for the payment of the bond, was absolute to Isaac Beckley and his assignee. It was a covenant that ran with the bond, and was as extensive in its terms as was the bond. The <a id="p293" href="#p293" data-label="293" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*293</a>guaranty was co-extensive with the bond. It was not to pay the bond to Isaac Beckley, but to him, his heirs and assigns. The act of 1715 was more comprehensive than the statute of Anne, and the court will give it a liberal construction.

The statute, which gives an action to the legal assignee of a bond, does not give him an action on a contract which, though ancillary, is collateral to it. To have the benefit of that, he must use the assignor’s name. In Davies <em>v. </em>Barr, <a href="/citations/?q=9%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%20141" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="9 Serg. &amp; Rawle 141">9 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 141</a>, it was held, that, with an agreement by the original parties to restrain the use of a bond, an assignee of it had nothing to do; and how much more fit the application of the principle to the contract of a third party! The very point was decided in McDoal <em>v. </em>Yeomans, <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Watts%20362" class="citation" data-index="10" data-cite="8 Watts 362">8 Watts, 362</a>, where it was held, that a parol contract of guaranty did not pass by the endorsement of a promissory note. The present is a covenant to guaranty the payment of a bond; but the difference does not impede the application of the principle.</p>
