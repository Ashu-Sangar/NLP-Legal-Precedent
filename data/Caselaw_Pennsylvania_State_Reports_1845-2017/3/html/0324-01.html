      <em>July </em>6. One point only arose on this record. The plaintiffs sued on an insolvent bond, on which one of the obligees had been discharged from arrest, and his application as an insolvent dismissed. The bond had been taken and approved by the deputy or clerk in the prothonotary’s office; and the court (Conyngham, President J.) considering he had no authority, and consequently that the bond was void, directed a verdict for defendants.</p>

The creditor did forego the right of approval in this instance, by the very act of suing on the bond as a valid one; and it is immaterial, therefore, whether the act of approval be judicial, or susceptible of performance by a deputy, as it is clear, that the omission of it by the prothonotary or his clerk, or by both, could not be insisted upon as a defeasance, after the bond had done its office in setting the insolvent debtor at large.’ As the certificate of approval is no part of the instrument, the contract is complete without it; and it would be strange if the party bound by it might avoid its obligations, by insist- ’ <a id="p325" href="#p325" data-label="325" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*325</a>ing on an accidental omission in a matter with, which he had no concern, and which benefited instead of prejudicing him; and by thus turning a clause introduced into the statute for the creditor’s safety, to his detriment.
