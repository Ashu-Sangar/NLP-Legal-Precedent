      <em>May </em>25. This action was brought by Silas Alexander and Cyrus Alexander, for the use of Cyrus Alexander, the plaintiffs in error, against James Alexander, to recover money paid by the plaintiffs, for the use of the defendant.</p>

The note was not paid at maturity, when it was protested, and a'suit brought against the drawers, in which a judgment was recovered against them. On this judgment a <em>ft. fa. </em>was issued, when Cyrus Alexander paid.the debt, interest and costs, and obtained an assignment of the judgment. Cyrus and Silas Alexander, being partners, then brought this action against James Alexander. The declaration, besides a special count, in which the note was set forth, contained one for money paid for the use of the defendant, and one for money had and received to the use of the plaintiffs, &amp;c.</p>

To his admission the defendants objected, and exhibited the note referred to, for the purpose of showing that he was one of the drawers thereof, and consequently not a competent witness. The objection was sustained; and this was plaintiff’s first bill of exception. Cyrus Alexander, one of the <a id="p57" href="#p57" data-label="57" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*57</a>plaintiffs, then executed a release at bar, to Joseph Alexander, and again offered him as a witness. Objected to, on the following grounds. (1st,) Interest. (2d,) That the release was executed but by one of the drawers, plaintiffs. (3d,) That a drawer cannot change, by his testimony, the liabilities of the parties to the note. (4th,) That the release executed and delivered at bar was insufficient and no release; because no value had been given for it. The court again rejected the witness; which was plaintiff’s second bill of exception.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b55-4" data-blocks='[["BL_55.4",55,[133,861,1185,1012]]]'>The plaintiffs, after giving in evidence, under objection, the note set forth in the declaration, the record of the suit brought by the Bank of Lewistown against the drawers of the note, with the proceedings thereon, and proving the payment of the judgment, again renewed their offer of Joseph Alexander, as a witness, which was objected to by the defendant. The court, in rejecting the witness on this occasion, said, «that this was an offer to prove, by one of the drawers of the note, that the defendant, who was the payee in the note, and also one of the endorsers thereof, was accountable for the whole amount, and was to pay the amount when the note fell due, and that he agreed to pay it before, as well as after the note was made. In other words, that the drawers were not to be liable to the payee; but that he, as endorser, was to pay it. This would be to fix on the endorser a liability which the drawers had assumed to him, as the payee, and that, too, by the testimony of one of themselves.” This decision of the court constituted plaintiff’s third bill of exception. Several other bills of exceptions to the admission and rejection of evidence were taken on the trial, which are not considered of sufficient importance to be stated here. The jury found a verdict for the defendant. The material question raised here was, whether Joseph Alexander was a competent witness.</p>
