It was used for that purpose, from the time of its erection until the year 1829, when a new court-house and offices were erected on another part of the same square, in which the courts have been held, and the public offices kept since that time. A part of the old building the jury found was then used as an office by one of the defendants, who was the county treasurer, and the other part was occupied by the other defendant, as a printing-office: the commissioners having leased it to him, reserving a certain yearly rent to be paid into the county treasury. The town of Bedford was laid out by the proprietary in <em>1766. </em>The old building always has been, and now is, under the control of the county commissioners. Whether the defendants were guilty, or not guilty, the jury said they were ignorant, and that they therefore found the above stated facts, which they referred to the court for their judgment thereupon. It appeared that on the same day this verdict was rendered, the counsel of the defendants moved in arrest of judgment, on the ground that the facts stated in the verdict did not amount to guilt in the parties indicted; and that when all the facts and circumstances which appeared of record, were taken and considered together, <em>it </em>was manifest that the <a id="p205" href="#p205" data-label="205" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*205</a>offences charged in the indictment had not been committed by the defendants.

It was a similar usage which, in Piper <em>v. </em>Singer, 4 Serg. and Rawle, 354, exempted the courthouse of Westmoreland county from taxation for borough purposes, though built on a town lot in Greensburg, which it held like any other proprietor. County commissioners have no greater right than an individual has to disturb the citizens in the enjoyment of a municipal franchise, at least beyond the bounds of absolute necessity; and the right of even the corporate authorities to erect buildings, seems, from what was said in Rung <em>v. </em>Shoenberger, <a href="/citations/?q=2%20Watts%2024" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="2 Watts 24">2 Watts, 24</a>, to stand on the same foundation. The public square is as much a highway as if it were a street; and neither the county nor the public can block it up, to the prejudice of the public or an individual; nor can either assert a right to it by enclosing it beyond the limits of a reasonable curtilage. It is dedicated to the use of all the citi<a id="p207" href="#p207" data-label="207" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*207</a>zens as a highway, and all have a right to pass over it without unreasonable let or hindrance; ip which respect it differs from the public squares in Philadelphia,'which are dedicated to health and recreation, and which are necessarily subjected to regulation by the local authorities. Now, what is the case which is presented by this special verdict ? Bedford was laid- out as a county town, by the proprietary of the province, in 1766 ; and the building in question was erected by the county commissipners before the year 1800, on a part of the great square, divided into four by the intersection of the two principal streets at its centre. From the time of its erection it was ysed for the offices of the county till the year 1829, when a new court-house with offices was erected on another quarter of the square. A part of this old building is now let by the commissioners at a yearly rent for a printing-office, and the rest of it is used by one of the defendants as the office of the county treasurer. Each of these purposes is unlawful. The first is founded on a supposition of title which will not bear a moment’s consideration; and the second, though not so flagrantly, is equally founded in wrong. The commissioners have no more right to hold this part of the square than they would have to hold the whole of it, by distributing the public buildings to the four quarters of it. When they removed the court-house and offices to another part of it, their duty required them to remove the materials of the old buildings, or abandon them to the municipal authorities; and by omitting to do so, they became obnoxious to the offence of which they stand indicted.</p>
    <p id="b205-4" data-blocks='[["BL_205.4",205,[340,1645,1017,283]]]'>It is considered by the court here, that the judgment of the Court of Quarter Sessions be reversed; that the nui-. sanee in the indictment mentioned be abated at the proper cost of the defendants; that they pay a fine of one dollar each, and the costs of prosecution; and that they stand committed till this sentence be complied with.</p>
