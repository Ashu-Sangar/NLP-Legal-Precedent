      <em>July </em>15. Replevin. — The plaintiff having given evidence of title to the property, the defendant rested his title on a constable’s sale as the property of the plaintiff’s brother. Having shown a judgment before a justice of the peace against Sill and C. Camp, the brother of plaintiff, in Wysox township, offered in evidence an execution issued “to the constable of Herrick township,” and the return by the constable of Standing-Stone township. It was conceded that Standing-Stone was an adjoining township to Herrick, in which the defendant resided; plaintiff residing in • Wysox. That the constable of Standing-Stone lived four miles-from Sill, and five and a half from C. Camp, and was the nearest constable to the justice. That Sill lived a half mile from the line of Standing-Stone township. That the constable of Herrick lived ten miles from Camp.</p>

The Supreme Court has very properly-allowed the magistrate a liberal discretion in the direction of his process. It has been held that a warrant directed by the justice to-constable, if it is executed <em>by the proper constable of the district, </em>is well directed. The reason given is, that the word constable, with a <em>blank, </em>cannot be said to be directed to the wrong constable, and may be understood as directed for the right one. It is better to direct it to the constable by name, or to the constable of the district generally.

His sale was as if no execution had issued. His acts were utterly void; and he was a trespasser. It is contended we should sanction this practice, because it prevails, and is convenient in Bradford county. If so, the sooner an end is put to the practice the better. There is no law to authorize it; and all trading between constables leads to corruption and injustice, and should be discouraged. This court decided in Pittsburg, at the last term,<a class="footnotemark" href="#footnote_1_1" id="ref_footnote_1_1">*</a> a case from Fayette county, that when one constable handed an execution to another to collect for him, and he received the amount of the execution from the defendant, and then ran off; his bail was not liable.
