The terms ‘necessary <a id="p334" href="#p334" data-label="334" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*334</a>and useful for public or private purposes,’ employed in this statute, are to receive a reasonable construction. They do not imply any such necessity, as that without the road, the plaintiffs’ coal would be utterly worthless, or that it could not, by carts, wagons, or wheelbarrows, be transported to the public improvements, or that there is no other route, along which, by the expenditure of large sums of money, a road might not be made. The law intended to secure to owners of mines within the prescribed distance, upon paying the assessed damages to intervening owners, such reasonable facilities for reaching the public improvements, as would enable them to bring the mineral wealth of the state to market. The necessity, therefore, contemplated by the statute, is only such as is found in giving a ■'reasonable facility for reaching the public improvements. The courts have uniformly given this construction to similar phraseology in the general road laws. The viewers of county roads are required to •report whether the road located by them ‘be necessary for a public ■or private road.’ It was never supposed any absolute necessity was intended. If the convenience of the public and the facilities of general travel would be increased, the road was always deemed necessary. Such, too, is the proper view of this lateral railroad law, and this is the necessity to be ascertained by the jury. It is with this construction of the act submitted to the jury to ascertain whether the proposed road is necessary and useful. This answers the fifth point proposed by defendant’s counsel.</p>

      <em>“ </em>The title of the plaintiffs, as exhibited and proved to the court, is ■ sufficient; and the question of intervening land is a matter of fact to be ascertained by the jury from the evidence. The proposed road is located from the tunnel leading into the mines, in the side of the hill, to the Nanticoke pool; and in the present case, whether that is intended for the whole extent of a railroad or not, or whether, after entering the mines, other roads are to connect with it, is not essential. There was no necessity for showing how it was to be extended in the interior of the mines, even if there it passed over other lands. That is an affair belonging to others, and not important to the defendant or to this case. The road leads from a point where the coal is delivered from the mines to the public improvements, and that is sufficient for this case. This answers the second point; and, in this connection, the sixth point is answered in the affirmative; and the jury will decide whether the plaintiffs have a practical route for a <a id="p335" href="#p335" data-label="335" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*335</a>road on their own land. If they have, they cannot cross the defendant’s land.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b333-4" data-blocks='[["BL_333.4",333,[146,506,1191,1256]]]'>“ The answer to the third point is to be found in the reply which the jury may give to the general question, of whether the road be necessary. The location and erection of the prior road, by Mr. Thomas, is to be considered by the -jury in passing upon this question; for if the plaintiffs’ coal mine can be reasonably accommodated by the road already constructed, they having the right to use that road at the stipulated tolls, then there can be no necessity for this road. This is matter of fact for the jury. The existence of Thomas’s is not conclusive that no other is necessary; nor does it bar the right of other owners of mines to have a road through the defendant’s lands to the pool, if they come within the provisions of the act. Neither is the location of this road within the twenty feet appropriated to, but unoccupied by prior road, a cause of objection by the defendant. The applicant for that’ road might perhaps object, if it were injurious to his interests; but he raises no objection, and from his testimony here in court, it would seem clearly that the proposed road has his hearty concurrence, for he gives us his opinion that it is indispensably necessary for the plaintiffs. The evidence seems to show that a double track along the prior road would-be sufficient for the plaintiffs until the cars should reach the schute, but it also seems clear in the evidence that a schute cannot be used to any advantage by more than one owner. Each owner, if doing any considerable business, must have a schute, or delay, confusion, and great perplexity must arise. This part of the road, leading from the curve into the pool, is therefore the most important part of the road to the plaintiffs, and the’ great object of these proceedings.</p>

That there is no conceivable difference in principle, between the grant of the right of way to be used by cars on wood and iron, or by carts <a id="p336" href="#p336" data-label="336" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*336</a>and wagons on stones and earth. The state grants six per cent, of lands for roads, and the mode, manner, and time of locating and constructing is necessarily an incident of her sovereignty. To deny her right to grant roads across the lands of her citizens, leading to her public works, would be to deny her sovereignty, and with it her ability to provide for the increase of her wealth and the happiness of her citizens. From tire first period of her existence she has exercised the power of laying out and constructing roads, and is alone the judge of the proper kind, the necessary width, and suitable termination. The exercise of this power, except in relation to the present statute, has never been questioned in any court. It is too late now to turn back the whole current of enactment, and set aside all road laws, as the principle asked to be established in this case would do. The state has always been generous in compensating for all injuries done by her public or private roads.</p>

Every man who holds lands from, the Commonwealth, has an express grant of six per cent, for roads. He may fairly be considered as holding in trust to that amount, for the state; the trust property to be reclaimed at the will of the state. Compensation, therefore, for lands taken for roads in Pennsylvania, is a gratuity; and if lands be thus taken without any provision for compensation, there would be no infraction of the Constitution. Roads leading from individual coal mines to the state canals may with propriety be considered public roads, inasmuch as they contribute, by the payment of tolls upon the coal transported, to the public burdens.</p>

The court think the jury, in ascertaining them, should consider. — 1. The value of the land. 2. The injury to the adjoining lands ; and 3. The injury to the defendant’s landing, by the erection and use of the road. The plan of the road defines the termination in a schute, which is to be erected below low water-mark; and the plaintiffs claim that at that point they have the same rights with the defendant, and therefore no damages ought to be assessed for any injury to be sustained by depriving him of the use of his landing, beyond the width of the road. It is admitted that the river, up to the water’s edge, whether it be high or low water, is a public highway of common right for every one; but it is so for the purposes of passage only. The shore is private property; and the right of landing on the shore is individual right. The plaintiffs, by the erection of their road, take away from the defendant a certain portion of this right; and it is in the evidence that the necessary distance above and below the road will be considerable; and for this he ought to be compensated. It is true, that upon the river, in the prosecution of their lawful business, the plaintiffs and defendant are upon an equal footing; and should they, in conducting their business, necessarily line the shore with their boats, so that he could not approach his landing, it would be <em>damnum absque injuria. </em>But this is a different case. The plaintiffs make a road, which, in its necessary use, occupies a full boat’s length of the landing; and although the road itself is not so wide, yet its use as effectually deprives the defendant of his landing, as if it extended to the boat’s length. The landing constitutes the chief value of the property ; and the defendant ought to be paid for so much of it as he will be necessarily deprived of, by the use of the road in the manner proposed by the plan.</p>

After this has taken place, the endeavour is made to deprive him of his land by the act of Assembly passed since that time. Dwarris on Statutes, 77, 9 Law Library, 750. This act of Assembly, of 5th May, 1832, should have a strict construction, because it takes away private rights. I supposed such was to be the construction.</p>

This application is made by John Bennet, the lessee, acting for himself. The notice is made by John Bennet, lessee and agent for these men.

The intention of the legislature evidently was, that a sum should be paid, equivalent to the value of the land to the owner. They prove, by their own evidence, that this road was necessary for private use : nobody could use it but those applying for it. Suppose these persons should divide their lands, would not each one have the power to deprive Harvey of so much of his land as would accommodate them ? Surely this might be done to the manifest detriment of Harvey, if this is to be the construction of the act.</p>

Pamphlet Laws, 501; Purdon, 155, sixth edition. Viewers and appraisers were appointed, who found the necessity of the road, and appraised the damage sustained by Harvey, at $300. From this report Harvey appealed. On the trial of the appeal, in the Common Pleas, the jury found for the plaintiffs; and further, found the necessity of the road, on the route as located by the viewers, and assessed the damages to be paid to the plaintiff in error, at $575.</p>
    <p id="b338-5" data-blocks='[["BL_338.8",338,[302,1298,1174,92]]]'>On this verdict the court entered judgment. On the trial, the counsel of Harvey took six bills of exceptions to evidence.</p>
    <p id="b338-6" data-blocks='[["BL_338.9",338,[301,1396,1179,575]]]'>First. To the admission, in evidence, of the petition for the view, and to the notice to Harvey of the application; because the petition and notice were not signed by the owners of the coal-mine. The petition was in the name of the owners, and the names of all the owners were put to the petition by John Bennet, their agent and lessee. The notice was signed by G. W. Woodward, attorney for Charles Lloyd, Thomas Bennet, Ellis Lewis, Ebenezer Greenough, and William Parsons. We deem this a substantial compliance with the act of the legislature, which requires the proceedings to be in the name of the owners. Here the petition and notice was in the name of the owners, by their agent and attorney. There was no error in admitting the petition and notice in evidence.</p>
    <p id="b338-7" data-blocks='[["BL_338.10",338,[304,1978,1176,468]]]'>Second. The second bill of exceptions was, to the admitting in evidence to the jury, the notice to the defendant, of Charles Lloyd, Thomas Bennet, Ellis Lewis, Ebenezer Greenough, and William Parsons, of the time and place of the meeting of the viewers, because it did not pursue the petition and order. The notice referred to the petition and draft filed. It gave the names of the viewers, and of the time and place of meeting, as well as the duty to be performed, and advised the plaintiff in error to attend, if he thought proper. We see no variance between the notice and the petition and order.</p>
    <p id="b339-3" data-blocks='[["BL_339.3",339,[168,419,1182,189]]]'>
      <a id="p341" href="#p341" data-label="341" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*341</a>Third. The third exception was to the admitting in evidence the whole proceedings of the viewers, and appeal of the defendant. The record of the proceedings in the case, so far as the cause had progressed, was properly admitted.</p>
    <p id="b339-4" data-blocks='[["BL_339.4",339,[166,614,1187,761]]]'>Fourth and fifth have been argued together. The plaintiffs had proved by Freeman Thomas, that the railroad was highly necessary and useful to their coal bed, and further offered to prove by the witness, the capacity of the road built by him to convey coal, (which was to be part of the road laid out by the plaintiffs,) that it had not sufficient capacity to accommodate the plaintiffs, and that there was but three tracts of coal land which could find an outlet at the place where this road crosses the defendant’s land; and this, for the purpose of showing that there would be but a small quantity of coal to be deposited at his landing. All this was clearly proper to go to the jury, to enable them to determine, first, the necessity for the road; and secondly, the damage which this right of way would be to the defendant. It would have been impossible for the jury to have come to a just conclusion on the questions which they had to determine, if the evidence, which explained all the circumstances of the case, had been excluded from their consideration.</p>
    <p id="b339-5" data-blocks='[["BL_339.5",339,[170,1390,1184,236]]]'>Sixth. The defendant’s counsel proposed to call a witness, to prove how much the property of Harvey would be injured by the proposed road; and how much the property of the plaintiffs would be enhanced in value, by the privilege of making the road as vset forth in the application.</p>
    <p id="b339-6" data-blocks='[["BL_339.6",339,[167,1634,1189,421]]]'>The court very properly admitted the question to be answered, so far as it related to the injury of Harvey, the defendant. Their decision was equally correct in rejecting proof of the benefit to the plaintiffs. If a defendant, living on the bank of the Pennsylvania Canal, was to receive the value of the coal-mine behind his strip on the river, the lateral railroad law would be a dead letter. It would be no benefit, either to the owner of the, mine in the rear, or to the public. No one would be so foolish as to build a railroad, and dig his coal for the benefit of another.</p>
    <p id="b339-7" data-blocks='[["BL_339.7",339,[175,2071,1177,91]]]'>Seventh. The last error assigned is to the court’s answers to the defendant’s points.</p>
    <p id="b339-8" data-blocks='[["BL_339.8",339,[168,2170,1185,285]],["BL_340.1",340,[261,408,1181,287]]]'>The charge of the learned judge of the special court is so full and perfect an answer to the questions raised, that I deem it unnecessary to take them up in detail. The argument of the defendant, that the act of Assembly authorizes the taking of the land of one, and giving it to another, is a perfect fallacy. All that the act does, is the giving of one the right of way over the land of another, for a <a id="p342" href="#p342" data-label="342" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*342</a>special purpose, after making full compensation. This is within the letter and spirit of the defendant’s grant, and shows the wisdom of the proprietor of Pennsylvania, and the Commonwealth since the Revolution, which gave to every man sis per cent, for roads and highways, which he holds in trust for the benefit of the public, until the road or highway is required.</p>
    <p id="b340-4" data-blocks='[["BL_340.4",340,[953,700,441,44]]]'>The judgment is affirmed.</p>
