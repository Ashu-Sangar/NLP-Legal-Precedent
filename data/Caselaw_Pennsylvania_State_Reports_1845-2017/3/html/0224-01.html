      <em>June </em>13; The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, for the use of George May, against John McVicker. — This was an action of debt on the official bond of the defendant, who was the sheriff of Bedford county. It was alleged that the sheriff had violated one of the conditions of his bond, in taking the goods of the plaintiff, on an execution against another. The evidence showed, that on the 27th of March, 1843, Joseph May, the keeper of a public house, made a transfer of all his household, bar, and kitchen furniture, to his son, George May, the plaintiff in this suit, who was then living with him. An inventory and valuation of the goods thus sold, was made in the presence of witnesses, for which the plaintiff gave his promissory notes. These notes were subsequently, in part, paid. After the transaction, Joseph May and family continued to live together in the usual way until the 1st of April, then next, when they removed together to- another tavern-house, of which, from that time forward, the plaintiff took the entire management and responsibility. He opened it in his own name, had his name affixed to the sign, and stocked and kept it on his own account. He used the goods embraced in the bill of sale from his father, indiscriminately with other furniture purchased by him from different persons. From the time the plaintiff opened the new tavern, his mother and sister acted in the capacity of housekeepers for him, and his father did jobs in andi about the house. On the 20th of July, 1843, Joseph S. Morrison <a id="p225" href="#p225" data-label="225" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*225</a>obtained a judgment against Joseph May, which was entered of August Term, 1843. On this judgment, a writ <em>offi.fa. </em>was issued, under which the sheriff seized and sold the- property of the plaintiff, embracing not only the furniture bough! from his father, the defendant in the execution, but that purchased by him from other persons, and also corn and potatoes, the products of a lot rented by the plaintiff, and then in his occupancy.</p>

The case seems to be, that on the 27th of March, the father, then keeping a public house, made a bill of sale of the goods to the plaintiff, his son, and an inmate of the family, and received his promissory noles for the price of them, a part of which has been-paid; and that the parties lived together in the same way till the 1st of April, when the son opened another tavern, stocked and kept by him on his own account, when the goods in question were used by him indiscriminately with others bought by him from different persons. It is not too much to infer from this, that they were purchased with a view to this particular destination; and the want of a formal delivery at the sale,- which might have been considered as an idle and suspicious ceremony, may thus be -satisfactorily explained and accounted for. It would have been of no practicable use to separate them from the father’s other goods, and lock them up for the four intervening days, even if he had been provided with a place to keep them, when the want of such a measure could have given the father ■no appreciable degree of false credit with the public. - A different construction vrould make a thing purchased from the father useless to the son, so long as he continued to inhabit the paternal mansion. When the son opened the new tavern, his mother and sister kept house for him, and his father did jobs; but the son’s possession and use of the .goods were exclusive. But if mere cohabita-, tion were a badge of fraud, a father’s sale to his unmarried son would seldom be sustained. It certainly was not necessary for the son to turn his father out of doors; and the direction seems to have been entirely proper. i</p>
