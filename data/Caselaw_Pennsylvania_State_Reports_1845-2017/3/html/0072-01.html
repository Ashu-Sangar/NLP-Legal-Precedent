      <em>May </em>28. This was an action of ejectment, brought by Samuel Hepburn, the plaintiff in error, who was plaintiff below, against John Snyder and others, for the undivided third part of three thousand acres of land, in Lamar township, Clinton county. The action was instituted, as appeared by the paper book, to compel the specific execution of an agreement between the plaintiff and one Tunison Cor-yell, under whom the defendants held. It was admitted, that the title to the said three thousand acres was in John Curts, Samuel Hepburn, and Dr. James Hepburn, subject to the payment <em>of $700 on </em>one tract, sold to them by one Dr. Ard.</p>

Samuel Hepburn, by an article of agreement, dated the 22d day of November, 1833, agreed to sell to Tunison Coryell, all his interest and investment in the firm of Curts, Hepburn &amp; Co., in erecting and carrying on the Lamar Iron Works, and to convey to said Coryell, by deed, all his interest in all lands connected with said furnace, “that is to say, the one entire third part of the concern as it now stands, including every thing appertaining thereto, both real and personal,” except certain castings, book-accounts, notes, and judgments. And in consideration of this agreement on the part of Samuel Hepburn, Tunison Coryell, on his part, agreed “to pay the said Samuel Hepburn, the just and full sum <em>of five thousand </em>dollars, lawful money of this state, and to taire the aforesaid property, real and personal, subject to the same contracts and agreements, and liable to the same encumbrances, debts, <a id="p73" href="#p73" data-label="73" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*73</a>charges, and responsibilities, that the said Samuel is now liable to, as a partner of the said firm of Curts, Hepburn &amp; Co.and said Coryell further agreed, “to take the place of the said Samuel, in every particular connected with the aforesaid concern, and to release the said Samuel from any and every obligation he may be under, as a partner of the aforesaid firm, and also to indemnify him against all debts and liabilities that he may have contracted or incurred on account of the said firm.” It was also understood, “ that the said Coryell is to pay the one-third part of whatever balance may be due to the late firm of Hepburn &amp; Langcake, by the firm of Curts, Hepburn &amp; Co., for forge-rent, property and goods sold, &amp;c., by the former to the latter firm, upon a settlement between the two firms.” Pursuant to this agreement, a deed of conveyance of the property, dated the 3d day of December, 1833, was executed by Samuel Hepburn and wife, and delivered to Coryell. The deed contained and concluded with the following covenant: “It is also the understanding between the contracting parties, that the aforesaid Tunison Cor-yell is to take the estate above granted, subjected to the same contracts and agreements, and liable to the same debts, encumbrances, charges, and responsibilities, which the said Samuel is now liable to, as a partner of the firm of Curts, Hepburn &amp; Co., and he generally to take the place of the said Samuel in the said firm, and to keep him indemnified from all future liabilities on account thereof.” This deed was regularly acknowledged, on the 6th of December, 1833, and recorded on the 29th of April, 1834. Tunison Coryell and wife, by deed of assignment, dated the 1st day of February, 1834, and written on the back of their deed from Hepburn, for the consideration of $5000, assigned, transferred, and set over to Dr. James Hepburn, his heirs and assigns, <em>“all the </em>right, <em>title, interest, property, claim and demand, of them, the said Tunison Coryell, and Sarah his wife, in and to the several tracts of land, with the appurtenances, set forth and described in the within </em>deed.” This deed was regularly acknowledged and recorded. It appeared from the records of the Courts of Common Pleas of Lycoming and Centre counties, (in which the estate conveyed to Coryell was then situated,) that a number of judgments, amounting to about $4000, had been obtained and entered at different times, between the 19th of August, 1835, and the 21st of January, 1836, against Curts, Hepburn &amp;Co. The payment of these judgments, with their accumulated interest and legal costs, it was contended, constituted a part of the consideration, under the article of agreement, for which the deed was given to Coryell. It also appeared, that John Curts and Dr. James Hepburn, by deed of <a id="p74" href="#p74" data-label="74" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*74</a>voluntary assignment, dated 3ist of July, 1835, conveyed all their property, including the land in controversy, in trust, for the benefit of their creditors, to Anson V. Parsons, Tunison Coryell, and Saul McCormick, who, in the execution of their trust, sold the same.</p>

This was, however, a covenant which involved no more than the covenantor’s personal responsibility. What more is there in the conveyance? The grantee agreed “ to take the estate above granted, subjected to the same contracts and agreements, and liable to the same debts, encumbrances, charges, and responsibilities, to which the said Samuel (the grantor) is now liable, as a partner of the firm of Curts, Hepburn &amp; Company; and, generally, to take the place of the said Samuel in the said firm, and to keep him indemnified from all future liabilities on account thereof.” This also is a covenant, and the same in substance as the preceding one.
