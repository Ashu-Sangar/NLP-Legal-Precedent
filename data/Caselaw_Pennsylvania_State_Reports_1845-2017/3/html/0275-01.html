      <em>June </em>23. Michael Wagner, the defendant in error and plaintiff below, brought ejectment against Cyrus K. Snavely, the plaintiff in error and defendant below, for a'lót of ground situated in the township of South Lebanon, Lebanon county, containing -'three acres. On the trial, the plaintiff gave in evidence the record of a judgment for $213 13, in favour of the borough of Lebanon, against Cyrus K. Snavely, the defendant, entered on a bond with warrant of attorney, in the Court of Common Pleas of Lebanon county, to April Term, 1843, No. 75, on the 6th day of May, 1843, and payable on the 8th 'of May, 1843. On this judgment it appeared a writ <em>of fi. fa. </em>was issued to August Term, 1843, No. 11, which was returned by th.e sheriff, “made on personal property $91 45, and levied on real estate and condemned, as per inquisition annexed. Levied on about three acres of land, more or less.” The land so levied on and condemned, was sold by the sheriff .under a writ of <em>all ven. ex. </em>to Michael Wagner, the plaintiff, for-$129; and the deed of the sheriff to Wagner for the land so purchased was acknowledged in open court on the 8th day of January, 1844. It was admitted on the trial, that the defendant was in possession at the time of the levy and sale, and that he continued in possession.</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b274-4" data-blocks='[["BL_274.4",274,[308,521,1190,433]]]'>■ -It appeared from the paper book, that this evidence was offered for the purpose of showing that Cyrus K. Snavely, who took <em>this </em>property at the appraisement, had at most but a life-estate in it, which could not be sold by the. sheriff in the manner it was sold. The plaintiff objected to the evidence, on the ground that as the defendant in the judgment was in possession at the time pf the levy and. sale, and at the time of suit brought, he could make no defence. The court sustained the objection, and the rejection of this evidence constituted the bill of exception, and the only error assigned here.</p>

By the purchase under regular process, the purchaser acquires a right, at least to the possession of the debtor, 'which alone will support the action of ejectment. But this principle cannot apply where the process is void; as where the sheriff undertakes to sell a life-estate, which he cannot do, as is ruled in Dennison’s Appeal, 1 Barr, 201, and in a case ruled at this term, and not yet reported. In the one case, the purchaser has some <em>right; </em>here he has none, as the proceeding of the sheriff is altogether void. The evidence offered by the defendant proves that the husband took his wife’s purpart in land, <em>not money, </em>and that.it was of less value than her share of the estate. The husband having nothing'to pay out'of his own funds, acquires but a life-estate, as is ruled in Blocker <em>v. </em>Carmony, administrator of Hess, <a href="/serg-rawl/1/0460-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="1 Serg. &amp; Rawle 460" data-case-ids="1796803" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/1/0460-01">1 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 460</a>: a case which cannot be distinguished from the present.</p>
