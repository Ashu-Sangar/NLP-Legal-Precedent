Thus, where the commissioners become the purchasers, and no bond is given, the owner can redeem within five years; and at the expiration of that period, if not redeemed, the commissioners are authorized to sell the land for the most that can be obtained for it, and <em>the </em>surplus, after paying taxes and expenses of sale, goes into the county treasury. In these cases, the owner, after five years, loses not only the land, but has no claim for the surplus arising from the sale made by the commissioners. But if the land is purchased by any other than the commissioners, the time of redemption is limited to two years, but the purchaser is required to give his bond for the balance of the. purchase’ money, upon which the owner of the land must proceed within five years, or his remedy for the ’money is barred by the .express provisions of the statute. The bond directed to be given is the creature of the statute; it derives its force and validity from this legislative enactment; but the same sburce, from which it derives its origin, has prescribed the only mode by which it can be enforced, and the period within which it can be made available to the person seeking'to recover.</p>

They certainly have provided no mode of recovery after that period, if we are to judge of their intention in the usual mode. The bond is made'a lien on the land sold for five years, by merely filing the same in the prothonotary’s office; and it is a proceeding <em>in rem, </em>against the land, and not against the person of the obligor, that is contemplated by the legislative provisions on this subject.</p>

In the absence of any provision in the statute, it would be a monstrous construction to say, that because the remedy against the particular tract was gone, the bond therefore became a nullity.

There can be no reason or justice in his getting the land without paying for it, or in saying, that because the bond, which, in its nature, is a security that endures at least twenty years, is not demanded within five years, it becomes null and void. It <a id="p93" href="#p93" data-label="93" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*93</a>would require clear and express words to affect a result so manifestly unjust. The object of the limitation contained in the act was entirely different. It was merely in consonance with the rule most usually pursued in our legislature, to exempt the land in the hands of the purchaser at treasurer’s sale from the lien of the surplus bond, after the expiration of five years, without suit: in order that such purchaser'might then be able to imj ve it whh security, or to sell it to others, free from charge. Thoug 1 the language of the act is not so clear and precise as it might have been, yet we think it evident, that such is the drift and design of the different clauses of the act compared together; and that the bond remains in full force and validity, and on the same footing as other bonds, so far as respects the remedy to recover upon it, except that of resorting to the land, after the expiration of five years from the. date of the deed.</p>
