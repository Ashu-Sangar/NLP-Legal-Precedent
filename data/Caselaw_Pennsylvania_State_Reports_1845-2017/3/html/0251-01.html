It was intended to cover the whole trust of William Stub, as executor, and there was no evidence to the contrary. He admitted that a bond might be reformed by parol evidence, which was clear and undoubted; certainly, where there was a mistake of <em>“fact.” </em>This case, he contended, came not within any of the exceptions to the rule. Here there was no evidence to show any thing like misrepresentation by the obligees; no evidence of mistake by the scrivener. Under an allegation of mistake by a scrivener, the proof must be clear that he inserted what he was not directed, or omitted to insert what he was directed. The direction must be clearly proved.
