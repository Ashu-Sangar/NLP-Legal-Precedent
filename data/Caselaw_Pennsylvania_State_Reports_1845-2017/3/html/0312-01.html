      <em>July </em>1. Appeal by Thomas Finney from the decree of the Court of Common'Pleas of Dauphin county, in the matter of the distribution of the money raised by a judicial sale of the real estate of Jacob Miller, so far as relates to the sum of $241 84, paid over by the sheriff, on a decree of the court, to Jacob Zeigler, the surviving assignee of the said Jacob Miller, for distribution under the deed of trust.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b310-6" data-blocks='[["BL_310.7",310,[283,1211,1185,1198]]]'>It appeared, that on the 25th day of September, 1839, Thomas Finney, the appellant, entered up a judgment against Jacob Miller, to August Term, 1839, No. 190, on a bond with warrant of attorney, and stay of execution until the 16th of September, 1840 ; and that this judgment was not revived within five years. The three following judgments were also entered against the said Jacob Miller, anterior to the execution of his deed of voluntary assignment. Christian Kintzel <em>v. </em>Jacob Miller, of April Term, 1840, No. 163. This judgment was regularly revived; and a <em>Ji. fa. </em>was issued on the judgment as revived, under which the defendant’s lands were levied upon and condemned. Thomas Finney <em>v. </em>the same, of April Term, 1842, No. 332; Christian Kintzel <em>v. </em>the same, of April Term, 1843, No. 259. On this judgment a <em>fi.fa. </em>also issued, under which the defendant’s lands were levied upon and condemned. It also appeared, that Jacob Miller, by deed of voluntary assignment, dated the 26th day of September, 1843, conveyed all his property to Jacob Zeigler and Henry Gayman, in trust for the benefit of his creditors. Subsequently to this, two other judgments were obtained and entered up against Jacob Miller; upon the latter of which, entered on the 6th of December, 1844, his lands were levied upon and condemned, and on the 7th day of April, 1845, sold by the sheriff, under judicial process, for the sum of $1561 00. On the 10th of December, 1845, Finney issued a <em>scire facias </em>to revive his judgment of August Term, 1839, No. 190, and obtained judgment thereon, on the 27th of January, 1845.</p>

      <a id="p313" href="#p313" data-label="313" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*313</a>On the 29th day of April, 1845, the court appointed an auditor to report the liens entered against Jacob Miller, and make distribution of the money made by a sale of his real estate. The auditor appropriated the greater part of the fund to the payment of the three judgments entered subsequently to that of Finney’s, but prior to the execution of the deed of assignment. The balance of the fund, amounting to $241 84, he' gave to the assignees of Jacob Miller, to be distributed under the deed of trust. In excluding the judgment of Finney from all participation in this fund, the auditor stated he was of opinion, that as it was not revived within the period of five years, the preference to which it had been entitled, as the first judgment against Jacob Miller, over subsequent judgments, was lost, and that with regard to such judgments, it had ceased to be a lien. On the 25th of September, 1845, the court confirmed the report of the auditor, and decreed, that the sheriff pay over to the assignee of Jacob Miller, immediately, the sum of $241 84. On the 26th of September, 1845, the court appointed the same auditor to distribute the balance of money in the hands of Jacob Zeigler, surviving assignee of Jacob Miller, as appeared on the face of his account, which was confirmed by the court; and also the sum of $241 84, the balance of the proceeds of the sale of the real estate of Jacob Miller, which remained in the hands of the sheriff, after the payment of liens, and which had been paid over to the said assignee, under a decree of the court. The auditor distributed this fund, <em>pro rata, </em>amongst the creditors by bond, note, book account, and judgments obtained subsequently to the execution of the deed of trust; amongst which latter was included the judgment of Finney. To this the following exception was filed :—</p>
