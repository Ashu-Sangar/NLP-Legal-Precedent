      <em>September </em>15.

The bill was drawn by the defendant, in Pittsburgh, on E. Lyttle &amp; Co., of Galena, Illinois, and accepted by them, for $311 50, dated March 11,1842, payable to Smith, Royer &amp; Co., or order, six months after date, at the Bank of Missouri, St. Louis; and was endorsed in blank by Smith, Royer &amp; Co., P. McGarr, and Myers, Richey &amp; Co., and specially, for purposes of collection, by W. H. Denny, cashier of the Merchants’ and Manufacturers’ Bank of Pittsburgh, to H. Shurlds, Esq., cashier, or order. After it had been protested and lifted, it passed into the hands of the plaintiff, for value, by delivery. The declaration contained three counts, charging McGarr, the defendant, in both characters as drawer and endorser, and alleging in the usual form, the drawing, endorsing, and acceptance of the bill, its presentment for payment, dishonour, protest, and notice to the drawer and endorsers at the proper time and places, and concluding <em>generally, </em>“to the damage of the plaintiffs, six hundred dollars.”</p>

The notary who had protested the bill for non-payment, and notified the drawer and endorsers thereof, had gone out of office, and was unable, as he was legally informed, to give a certified copy, under his former notarial seal, of the notarial register of his proceedings in this case. To prove this fact, and to supply the necessary secondary evidence of the protest, as well as proof of due notice of the dishonour of the bill, to the drawer and endorsers, the plaintiff took out a commission to take the deposition of the notary as to the facts; which was accordingly done, and the commission was duly executed, and returned with the answers of Andrew Elliott, the notary, to the interrogatories submitted.</p>

The act of January 2, 1815, relating to notaries, does not change the general commercial law in this respect. It is a remedial, and not a disabling statute. By the common law, before its passage, a foreign notary’s certificate of protest was evidence of the fact of protest, and proved itself. On the contrary, a domestic notary’s was not. His protest had to be proved by himself as a witness. Chitty on Bills, p. 642, 643, ed. of 1839; Story on Bills, 304, note 2. This act was passed, in the first place, to remove this difference ; and in the second, to make a domestic notary’s certificate evidence for more purposes than those of foreign notaries. <a href="/citations/?q=6%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%20329" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Serg. &amp; Rawle 329">6 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 329</a>, 331 ; 2 Barr’s Rep. 355.

The five per cent, damages given by the act of March 30,1821, are given as <em>fixed damages, </em>and not as a <em>penalty. ' </em>If given as a penalty they ought to have been specially claimed.

Fixed damages are given, in this and similar cases, on grounds of public policy and general convenience, in order to avoid numerous minute and perplexing inquiries.

The rules of pleading do not require these damages to be claimed specially: First, damages sustained by the breach of a contract are mere matter of evidence, and need not be specially alleged. They are scarcely ever claimed but in a general manner. <a href="/citations/?q=21%20Johns.%20Rep.%20149" class="citation" data-index="9" data-cite="21 Johns. Rep. 149">21 Johns. Rep. 149</a>. Their fixation by statute cannot change this rule. Second, when damages must necessarily be presumed from the breach of a contract, they need not be specially claimed. 1 Chitty’s Plead. 338, 395, 396. The court below in ruling this point admit, that <a id="p482" href="#p482" data-label="482" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*482</a>“interest and the costs of protest” may be recovered under the general claim for damages. Then why not “ the five per cent, damages ?” They are all given by the same statute. A general right to damages for the dishonour of foreign bills of exchange is given by the act of March 30, 1821, and therefore, it need not be specially pleaded. <em>■</em>

What then did they produce in the place of it? No less than a sworn copy of it by the notary himself, who testified that he was at the time a notary public, duly commissioned; that his term of office had expired; that no successor to him had been, or could be appointed; and that the laws of the state gave him no authority to certify any document under his former notarial seal. This, being the best evidence of which the nature of the case admitted, was sufficient to supply the want of a seal; but the protest itself, though proof of dishonour, would not have been evidence of notice, as our statute is expressly confined to protests made under the authority of our own state. For evidence of notice, however, the plaintiff relied, not on the protest, but on the testimony of the notary, who swore to all that was necessary to constitute it beyond contradiction, except that he did not expressly say that the notice put into the post-office by him was addressed to the defendant in Pittsburgh, where he resided. But the legal presumption is, that he did all that the law exacted of him as an officer or an agent; and it seems not to have been rebutted. The plaintiffs were properly allowed to recover them; but they were not allowed to recover enough.</p>

It is not given as a penalty for drawing without authority, but as commutation for interest, damages, and re-exchange. It is, in truth, a liquidation of the damages, not by the parties but by the law, fixing the compensation for the loss beforehand, to save time and litigation; and if damages need not be specially laid where there is no statute on the subject, as they certainly need not be in England, no rule of pleading requires them to be laid in their liquidated form. It is said in Chitty’s Pleading, 232, that such damages as may be presumed to result necessarily from the <a id="p483" href="#p483" data-label="483" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*483</a>breach of a contract, need not be specially laid; and damages are .presumed to result from the dishonour of a foreign bill: the very statute by which they are liquidated presumes it. Again, p. 387, it is said that general damages for torts are such as the law implies from the wrong, but that where there is no legal implication, the actual- damages must be particularly stated. On principles of analogy, therefore, as the law implies damages to the amount of five per cent, for the dishonour of the bill in question, it was unnecessary to lay them specially, either to apprize the defendant of what he had to encounter, for he could make no resistance, or to satisfy any rule of pleading applicable to declarations either for torts or contracts. The plaintiff, then, is entitled to the amount of the bill and five per cent, additional, with interest on the whole from the date of the protest to the date of the judgment below, which is to be considered as having been rendered for the sum then legally due; and the computation is referred to the prothonotary, who is directed to enter judgment for the amount.</p>
