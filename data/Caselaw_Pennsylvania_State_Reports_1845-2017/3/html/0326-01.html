The note is dated 24th of October, 1840, for the payment of $100, “to be paid in $25 a year, the first payment to be paid m March, 1842, with interest from March, 1841, on the whole, without defalcation or stay of execution. Witness my hand and seal.” As the note stood before the interlineation of the words “ on the whole,” no portion of the $100 would have drawn interest prior to the date of the note except the first payment, but this alteration makes the whole sum drawT interest back of the date of the note ; and the plaintiff shall not be permitted to say it is an immaterial alteration, for the intent of the forgery is evident on the face of the paper.</p>

The court ought to have charged that the alteration was not material. The promise was to pay a round sum in annual instalments ; the first, on a day certain, with interest from a year before it; and the doubt ivas whether the provision for interest included the whole or only this instalment. Why should that bear interest before it was due, and not the subsequent ones. The words do not lead to such a conclusion, and it would be absurd to intend it. The holder imprudently attempted to remove what he supposed to be an ambiguity; but he did not disturb the legal effect of the note, and consequently did not avoid it. Such is the principle of Trapp <em>v. </em>Spearman, 3 Esp. Rep. 57; Marson <em>v. </em>Petitt, 1 Camp. 82; Kershaw <em>v. </em>Coxe, 3 Esp. 246, and Webber <em>v. </em>Moddacks, 3 Camp. 1.</p>
