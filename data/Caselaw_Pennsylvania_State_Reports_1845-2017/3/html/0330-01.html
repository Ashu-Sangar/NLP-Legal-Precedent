      <em>July </em>7. This action was to recover the amount of a counterfeit bank note passed to the plaintiff by defendant, under the following circumstances :- — One Mills, having- <em>borrowed money </em>of plaintiff requested Horton, the defendant, to pay it out of a debt owing by himself to Mills. Horton called on defendant,)and with his own money paid part of the amount due by Mills, on his account. The note in question was objected to at the time, by the agent receiving it; and being subsequently discovered to be fraudulent, was tendered to Horton.</p>

J., instructed the jury, that Horton could be looked upon in no other light than as the agent of Mills; and the payment as respects this note was simply a nullity, and the parties <em>quoad hoc </em>restored to their original situation; otherwise, the plaintiff might-split his claim into several actions for this note, and for the unpaid balance. There was no consideration to sustain the action.</p>

Was not that his only recourse in this instance ? Mills, the debtor, requested Horton to pay his debt to Ramsdale, the plaintiff; and had Horton promised to pay in consideration of being accepted as debtor, in the place of Mills, Ramsdale might have maintained an action against him. But, on no other foundation could he stand in priority with him. Again, it is said, that money delivered to one, to be paid to another, may be recovered by the creditor from the intermediate party, as so much received to his use. But no money was received by Horton. Lastly, it is said, that a promise to one, for the benefit of another, will support an action by the party beneficially interested. But who is that party ? In Blymire <em>v. </em>Boistle, <a href="/watts/6/0182-01" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="6 Watts 182" data-case-ids="1846089" data-case-paths="/watts/6/0182-01">6 Watts, 182</a>, it was held, that the original debtor must have the means of enforcing a promise for the exoneration of himself; and that as both debtor and creditor cannot sue on it, he alone may. Here the promise was to pay the debt of Mills ; and as he alone can sue on it, he alone is liable to the plaintiff.</p>
