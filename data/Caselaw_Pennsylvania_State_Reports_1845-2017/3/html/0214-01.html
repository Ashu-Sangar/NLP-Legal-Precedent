It was then proved, that the defendant’s house was on the tract surveyed in the name of James Reed ; that a field was cleared on David Reed’s tract, and part of two on that of Joseph Reed.</p>

The witness also stated, that he saw two or three trees marked, which defendant said was his line. David Deneen swore that defendant, in 1825, showed him some blazed trees which he had marked ; that they looked as if they had been blazed a year or more, and that there were fifteen or twenty acres cleared about the house previously to August, 1822. Michael Reed said, he made a survey for the defendant on the 14th and 15th of August, 1844; that he found lines marked, which, in his opinion, were <em>twenty years old.</em>

It also appeared from the assessment lists of the township in which the lands in dispute lie, that Bishop-had paid the taxes only for two or three years during all the time of his residence, thereon.
