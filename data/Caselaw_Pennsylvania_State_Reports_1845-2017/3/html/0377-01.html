      <em>My 23. </em>Peter Drenkle, by written articles, agreed to sell a tract of land to K. &amp; J. Drenkle, for $3000, payable in annual instalments of $500, <em>“ </em>and to make, execute, and deliver a good and sufficient deed of conveyance for the same,” possession to be delivered on 1st April, 1836. The purchasers, also, acknowledged satisfaction of the legacies due from their father’s estate, in consideration of this conveyance. In March, 1836, Peter died; and K. &amp; J. Drenkle, the purchasers, shortly afterwards filed a petition in the Orphans’ Court, to have execution of this agreement, which was decreed. In December of that year, the widow of Peter executed a release to the purchasers for her dower in the land, saving her right to the purchase money, and the bonds given therefor to the administrators. Peter left ten children, among eight of whom his estate was to be divided. The administrators of Peter filed their accounts, asking a credit for the one-third of the amount of the purchase money paid to the widow. The allowance of this item forms the subject of exception here.</p>

By the execution of the articles, the vendor became a trustee of the title, and the vendee became a trustee of the purchase money, so that the beneficial ownership of each was transmuted. This elementary principle is sufficient for the determination of every case of the sort. Had the contract not been executed, the trusts would not have taken effect, and the interests under them being inchoate, would not have been perfected; but the conversion which was consummated by the conveyance executed by the administrators, related back to the date of the articles, and the vendor’s interest is to be treated as having been personal <a id="p379" href="#p379" data-label="379" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*379</a>estate from that time. Why, then, should not his widow have her third of <em>itf </em>Because, it is said, she had dower in the land at her husband’s death, and ought not to have her dower, and the price of it. But she released the dower to complete the purchaser’s title. Indeed, had she not done so, as is shown by Leinweaver <em>v. </em>Stoever, she might have had both, if the purchaser had agreed to take the land encumbered with her title. But, if this were even a case of election, she has made her choice by releasing the land, and resorting to the price of it. The payments to her, therefore, were properly allowed.</p>
