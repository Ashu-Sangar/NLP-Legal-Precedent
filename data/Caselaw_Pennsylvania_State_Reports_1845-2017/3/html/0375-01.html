      <em>July </em>22. On a feigned issue, to try the validity of judgment in favour of Chandler against one Spieglemoyer* it appeared, that a note payable in one year from date, with a warrant of attorney to confess judgment, was given in August, 1843, and judgment immediately entered. This was assigned to Snyder* in July, 1844; in October, to Gundrum, after payment of a claim of Cummings,; and in December,. Gundrum assigned it to Swengle,- and guarantied the payment.</p>

His admission was the only point noticed here. The defendant had previously called Glover, who stated, he was present at the execution of the note, and saw no money pass; that Barber and Spieglemoyer had had a settlement, and he saw no other note but this one to Chandler; that in the winter of 1843, Barber offered to sell it, and had it in his possession in the'spring before the trial; that he had seen a paper signed by Spieglemoyer to Gundrum, saying the judgment was all right. This Spieglemoyer refused to sign, unless Barber would make some other satisfaction to him; that in consideration of the paper to Gundrum, Barber gave him a paper to indemnify him. On cross-examination, the witness said, he could not say that the giving of the paper had any thing to do with the consideration of the judgment; that Spieglemoyer refused to settle it, claiming a balance, and spoke of his liability as bail for Barber and Wolf.</p>

There does not appear in the case, as it stands before us, sufficient evidence to warrant the conclusion that the assignment by Chandler, who was nominally the payee, but really a trustee for Barber, was executed with the intention of making Barber a witness to support the judgment: and, unless something <a id="p377" href="#p377" data-label="377" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*377</a>appears to induce a belief of such intent, the rule precluding an assignor from becoming a witness in favour of his assignee, does not apply. It was never determined that an assignor could not, under any circumstances, be such a witness, nor is there any reason for it. When the assignment is made at such time, and under such circumstances, as lead to no suspicion of collusion, the assignor may be a witness, unless he is a party to the record, or excluded by interest or other ordinary objections to his competency. Here the judgment was entered upon the 10th of August, 1843, and transferred to Charles A. Snyder, on the 5th of July, 1844, at a time when, so far as we know, no contest existed concerning the validity of the judgment. If there were circumstances of that character, it lay on the party objecting to show them, by examining the witness on his <em>voire dire </em>or by evidence <em>aliunde. </em>Judgment affirmed.</p>
