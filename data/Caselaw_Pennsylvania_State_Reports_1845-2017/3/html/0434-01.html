      <em>Sept. </em>8. This was an appeal by John Cornelius, the plaintiff in error, who was defendant below, from the judgment of a justice of the peace, in an action of trover and conversion brought against him by William Garwin, administrator of G.

August, 1843, the said William Garwin, administrator of <em>E. Vanarsdallen, </em>brought a suit of trover and conversion for the same fish seine valued at <em>sixty or seventy </em>dollars, and on the 18th of August, obtained a judgment for $60; from which judgment, the said John appealed, which appeal is entered to October Term, 1843, No. 334, and remains undetermined. And the said John saith, the said administrator of <em>E. Vanarsdallen, </em>and also of <em>G. Vanarsdallen, </em>is the same plaintiff in both suits, and that the cause of action is identically the same in both suits. That <a id="p435" href="#p435" data-label="435" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*435</a>tbe plea of a former suit pending as ábove stated, was entered before tbe justice, on the trial before him, and this, &amp;c.”’ To this plea, the plaintiff demurred. The demurrer stated in substance, that the said plea of the said defendant, and the matters therein contained, were not sufficient in law, &amp;c-.; and that-the plaintiff -was not bound to answer the same. “ Wherefori^he prayed judgment; and that the defendant answer further.” The court (Patton, President J.) thereupon directed judgment to be entered for-the plaintiff on the demurrer, and that the defendant answer over. The defendant then pleaded <em>non cul., </em>and obtained subsequently a rule to show cause, why the proceedings-in the case'should not be stayed, until the costs in No. 334, of October Term, Í843,'ih which plaintiff had'taken a nonsuit, were paid. This rule &gt;vas discharged; and on the 31st of January, 1846, the appeal was tried,, and a verdict and judgment for the plaintiff. The defendant, thereupon, sued out this writ of error. -</p>
