In 1833, B. went out of the firm, but continued to hold his interest in the real and personal property thereof. In 1836, changes in those having an interest in partnership property having taken place, and B. having <em>then </em>sold out his whole interest to A., A. gave to B. a bond of indemnity to save him harmless from all loss or responsibility on account of the partnership of B. &amp; Co., or any modification therein by change of parties, &amp;c. In 1838, one M. recovered a judgment against B. and another, as members of a firm of A. &amp; Co. B. having paid this judgment, brought suit against A. on the bond of indemnity, alleging, that A. &amp; Co. was a modification of B. &amp; Co. <em>Held, </em>(1st) that B., to support this action, must <em>prove, first, </em>the payment, or at least recovery of the judgment against A. &amp; Co.; <em>second, </em>that he was a member of the firm of A. <em>&amp; </em>Co., of which the judgment is <em>prima facie </em>evidence, but not conclusivo; <em>third, </em>that A. &amp; Co., was a modification of B. &amp; Co. (3d) A. never having been a party to the shit against A. &amp; Co., the writ not having been served on him, and having.no notice thereof, may controvert the record of that suit, to show that B. was not a partner of A. &amp; Co., and that there was a good defence known to B. of which he could, and ought to have availed himself. (3d) If B. suffered judgment to go against him either through ignorance, carelessness, or design, he cannot visit the loss on A., who only promised to indemnify him from responsibility arising from the firm of which he ■ had been a member. (4th) The expression in the bond of indemnity of 1836, “ that the said B. has now sold out his whole interest to A,” is not irreconcilable with proof, that B. ceased to be a member of the firm, or that the firm ceased to exist, in 1834.</p>

Blake &amp; Co. This is necessary, because Lothrop only agrees to indemnify Blake from losses which may arise from the copartnership, or any modification or change of parties in the same, and not from any responsibility which may accrue from any distinct and independent firm, even although he maybe a member of that firm; and next, because having averred this to be the true construction of the contract, he is bound to prove it. The <em>allegata </em>and probata* must agree. Now, how does the case stand on the evidence ? The plaintiff gave in evidence a suit, by one Samuel Millirons against Alden Lothrop, Sylvanus Lothrop, Henry Blake, and William C. Stewart, copartners, trading under the name and firm of Lothrop &amp; Co.; a judgment rendered thereon against Alden Lothrop, and Henry Blake, the writ having been served on-them only, and <em>n. e. i. </em>as to Sylvanus Lothrop, and William C. Stewart; a suit in the state of Ohio, on the judgment rendered against Blake, and endorsing that the money so recorded was paid or satisfied by him. The plaintiff, as before remarked, avers that Blake was a member of the firm of Lothrop &amp; Co., which averment he is bound to prove. Of this, the judgment against Blake and Lothrop is <em>prima facie, </em>but not conclusive evidence, and the testimony on the part of the defendant shows to a demonstration, that he, Blake, never was a member of that firm; and that if the objection had been taken, it would have been a conclusive bar to the recovery. Sylvanus Lothrop not being a party to the suit, the writ not having been served on him, and having, no notice thereof, is at liberty to contradict the reeord in this particular, and to show that there was a good defence known to the plaintiff of which he could, and ought to have availed himself. That the loss, if any, is the result of his own folly, if not, as is charged, proceeding from collusion with Millirons.</p>
    <p id="b491-5" data-blocks='[["BL_491.5",491,[160,2165,1185,288]],["BL_492.1",492,[294,424,1188,2027]],["BL_493.1",493,[155,411,1186,626]]]'>But the fundamental error of the court lies in assuming that the firm of Lothrop &amp; Co. is a modification of the firm of H. Blake &amp; Co. Lothrop agrees to indemnify Blake against all losses or responsibilities of every kind or description which may come or, fall to him (this, in substance, is the language of the agreement) from the copartnership of H. Blake &amp; Co., or any modification by change of parties <a id="p494" href="#p494" data-label="494" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*494</a>therein. The plaintiff avers that Blake was a member of the firm of Lothrop &amp; Co., and that the latter firm was a modification of the former firm. The inquiry therefore is, has the plaintiff sustained his declaration, or brought himself within the meaning of the agreement ? That he has failed in the first particular has been already shown. It is equally clear, he has not sustained the last. Setting aside the improbability that one firm, consisting of different individuals, with a different name, is a modification of a former firm, the evidence leaves no room for doubt on this point. In addition to the evidence of Joseph A. Stockton, who proves that Blake was not a member of the firm of Lothrop &amp; Co.; that it was a new and distinct firm; that he went out of the firm in July, 1833, the articles of agreement were given in evidence; and by this it appears, that in January, 1834, a new firm was formed under the name of Lothrop &amp; Co., consisting of Sylvanus Lothrop, Alden Lothrop, William Stewart. The debt due Millirons was against the latter and not against the former firm. In the suit, either through ignorance (which we cannot siqrpose) or design, he includes, contrary to the fact, Blake as a partner, and recovers judgment against him as such, through connivance, as the defendant charges. If Blake suffered judgment to go against him, either through ignorance, carelessness, or design, he has himself only to blame for it. He cannot be permitted to visit the loss on Lothrop, who only promises to indemnify him from responsibilities arising from a firm of which he was a member. To suppose he intended to guarantee him against any other firm, would be unreasonable, and is in fact contrary to the construction put upon the contract by the plaintiff himself, in setting out his cause of action. , Inasmuch, therefore, as it appears that Blake was not a member of the firm of Lothrop &amp; Co.; that this firm was not a modification of the firm of H. Blake &amp; Co., but a distinct and independent firm, with which Blake had no connection; the plaintiff has no cause of action, and the court ought so to instruct the jury. And if it had affirmatively appeared, that Millirons had a good cause of action against Blake, in consequence of their having failed or neglected to give notice of the dissolution of the partnership of H. Blake &amp; Co., which we do not concede; yet, whatever remedy he may have against the firm of Lothrop &amp; Co., he has no cause of action on the bond of indemnity. And this is manifest from this consideration. It would be unjust, that Lothrop should be compelled to pay a debt out of his own funds, which, if a debt at all, was not against him alone, but a firm of which he was but one of the members. In construing tire agreement, the court proceed on the erroneous supposition, that the article contains incontrovertible <a id="p495" href="#p495" data-label="495" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*495</a>evidence, that Blake continued a member of the firm, until the 4th July, 1836, the date of the bond of indemnity. But the expression relied on, that Blake had now sold out his whole interest to Sylvanus Lothrop, is not irreconcilable with proof, that he ceased to be a member of the firm, or that the firm ceased to exist in January, 1834. For, although that firm was dissolved, he had an interest in the assets, whether real or personal, and was liable for the debts; and to this the language of the parties obviously refers. Being in part the owner of the real estate does not constitute him a member of the new firm, nor of itself continue him.a member of the old firm. Nor does it entitle him to participate in the profits, or render him liable for the losses; nor does it subject him to a suit at the instance of those who may have dealt with the new firm.</p>
