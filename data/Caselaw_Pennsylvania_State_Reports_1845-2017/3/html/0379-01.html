The court then adjourned until half-past 2 o’clock, p. m. of the same day.

The object of the adjournment of courts, is to give leave to all parties that have any thing to do in court, to forbear their attendance till such a time. Tomlin’s Law Dic. 37. When the court adjourns, no one is bound to be present in court until the time of meeting fixed by the court. If the court be allowed to meet privately, and proceed <em>ex parte, </em>great abuses must ensue. Innovations in the administration of justice, which tend to detract from the rights of parties, are to be discouraged. Here the defendant had a right to except to the charge, and had to the last moment before the verdict was delivered at the bar in open court, to tender a bill of exceptions. <a href="/citations/?q=8%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%20216" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="8 Serg. &amp; Rawle 216">8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 216</a>.
