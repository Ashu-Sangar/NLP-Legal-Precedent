      <em>June </em>8. This was an action of trespass, brought by David White, the plaintiff in error, who was plaintiff below, against Henry Cooper, late sheriff of Perry county, for levying upon and selling a Store of dry goods, under sundry executions against Wilson Welch. The plaintiff claimed the goods sold as his property, and-, in support of the action, gave in evidence a written agreement between himself and one Wilson Welch, dated 2d of November, 1844, by which the plaintiff agreed to appoint Welch his agent to deal in produce, haul said produce to market, and to deal and trade for plaintiff, in such amount of capital and in such trade as should best suit both parties, so that the most could be made out of the means furnished. Plaintiff agreed to furnish Welch with wagons and horses to haul produce to market, and to furnish Welch with groceries to the amount of $300 to begin with, and Welch was permitted to purchase produce on plaintiff’s credit, to the amount of $150; Welch to attend to the business for plaintiff, the expenses to he first deducted from the profits, and the balance of profits to he equally divided between the parties.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b128-9" data-blocks='[["BL_128.9",128,[292,2010,1180,373]]]'>Plaintiff further proved by Wilson Welch, that he had contracted debts to a considerable amount, in the name of plaintiff, for dry goods purchased by said Welch, and that part of the goods thus purchased were the same that were levied and sold by the sheriff. It was also in evidence, that plaintiff carne over to Perry county, on the 11th August, 1845, and he and Welch took an inventory of the store, amounting to about $900. Part of the goods were then boxed, and the balance remained on the shelves.</p>

That when the sheriff went to levy on the store, in July, Andrew Welch claimed to hold the goods-as collateral security for the debt due to him. That after the sheriff made the levy, on the 19th July, Andrew Welch went over to Adams county, for plaintiff, White. That plaintiff came over, and plaintiff,- Andrew Welch, arid Wilson Welch, took an inventory of the goods and boxed up a part of them, on the 11th August. .That plaintiff then and afterwards declared to different witnesses, that-he had ndver heard or known of the store until that date. That tie sheriff came to Logsville, on the night after plaintiff and Welch had boxed up part of the goods, and secured them the next morning. That the day before the sheriff sold the store at Logsville, plaintiff told Dunbar, one of the execution creditors, that he could put him on a plan that his money might be secured. That Wilson Welch had a hogshead of queensware in Harrisburg, marked in his (plaintiff’s) name, which Welch would have brought to Landisburg or Bridgeport, in Perry county, that evening, and that Dunbar should get the sheriff to go to Landisburg or Bridgeport, and levy on it. That Dunbar, in pursuance of the information received from plaintiff, sent the sheriff to Landisburg, but the queensware had been unpacked in a small store kept by Hannah Welch, the sister of Wilson Welch, before the sheriff arrived.</p>

The merits of the case is embraced in the plaintiff’s second point. -This the court, declined answering in favour of the plaintiff, or rather answered it in the negative ; we think the plaintiff was entitled to a direct affirmative' answer. The proof is clear, and it is not controverted-by the defendant, that D. White furnished Welch with a sum of money to be employed in buying and selling produce. That he had a right, as agent of White,'to vest,, sell, -or reinvest White’s money; and he did so, and largely'increased the fund. Suppose Welch did, as defendant contends, by misfeasance in acting beyond the terms of his authority, vest the funds of White in any species of goods, such as were not contemplated by the original agreement, and Welch was insolvent, and the property purchased can be distinctly'traced, as it can be in this case, White, the principal, as the owner of it, may claim it, and i‘f assigned, he may follow it wherever it can be thus traced. “ It will make no- difference in law,” as Justice Story remarks, “ as indeed it does not in <a id="p134" href="#p134" data-label="134" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*134</a>reason, into whatever form, different from the original, the change may have been made. Whether it be into promissory notes, or othér securities, or into merchandise, or into stock, or into monéy; for the product of the substitute for the original thing still follows the nature of the thing itself, as long as it can be ascertained to be such, and the right only ceases when the means of ascertainment fail.” Story on Agency, p. 225, paragraph 229, p. 226, paragraph 230, and see references on pp. 226, 227; 3 Maule &amp;, Selw. 562.</p>

The proof is, that White’ never knew or heard of the purchase of the stores by Welch, until after they were levied on by the sheriff, and that he disaffirmed the acts of Welch by refusing to pay the notes given by Welch for those purchases, even after he brought this suit, in which he claims to recover damages for the sale of the goods, for the purchase of which, he refuses to acknowledge himself liable. The court in their answer submitted the question fairly to the jury, to determine whether the goods were honestly purchased by Welch as the agent of White, or whether the name of White was used in the purchase as a means of covering them from the creditors of Welch.</p>

White cannot be injured by the levy and sale, for the goods were not paid for, and he was not liable for their purchase. They were the property of Welch, until White, by an affirmative act, divested the property Welch had in them ; but it is too late after the levy is made, when no injury can result to White. Where personal property remains in the possession of vendor after a <em>bond fide </em>sale, it is subject to levy and sale by creditors; although the vendee may have paid a full consideration, and his title as between the parties is perfect. But in this case White had no property in the goods levied, and possibly never would have any; he cannot therefore acquire title after the interest of third persons have attached. If Welch was the owner when the levy was made, White cannot be permitted, by his own acts, to acquire a right which did not exist at that time.</p>
