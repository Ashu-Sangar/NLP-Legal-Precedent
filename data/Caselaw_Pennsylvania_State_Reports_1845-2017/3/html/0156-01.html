      <em>June </em>10. This was an appeal by creditors, who claimed under the official recognisance of the sheriff, from the decree of the Court of Common Pleas of Perry county, appropriating the money raised by a judicial sale of John McKenzey’s real estate.</p>

The recognisance was in the sum of <em>$10,000, </em>and was duly entered ^ of record, according to law. In 1845, the real estate'of John McKenzey, one of the sureties as aforesaid, was sold by the sheriff of Perry county, under judicial process issued, and directed to him ; and the money thus raised, paid into court for appropriation. It appeared, there was a suit pending on the bond of sheriff Magee, in Perry county, of November Term, 1846, and that there were other claims outstanding against the estate of Alexander Magee, .who was then deceased, and against his sureties. The Carlisle Bank recovered a judgment against John McKenzey, at August Term, 1842, and another judgment against the same, at-January Term, 1843. The purchaser of the land, and the creditors of Alexander Magee, late sheriff, claimed that the money in court should be applied to the recognisance; and the Carlisle Bank and the creditors of John McKenzey claimed, that it should be appropriated to the payment of the said judgment; and this was the question, submitted to the court below for decision. Whereupon, after argument, the court ordered the money to be paid to the judgmenty-creditors of McKenzey, in the order of their priority. An appeal was thereupon taken to this court by the creditors, who claiméd that the money in court should be applied to the recognisances, and the following error assigned:</p>

Is it not better that we should keep in view the often repeated legal policy of keeping estates subjected to judicial sale, untrammeled by liens ? If the lien of a sheriff’s recognisance be not divested by a judicial sale, it either precludes all sales of the estates of the recognisors, or subjects them to the intolerable sacrifice which would necessarily result from a sale of them, subject to the uncertainty of the extent of ■a sheriff’s official defalcation. It will not do to decide, that the estate of a sheriff’s surety shall not be subject to a sale for his debts, and if sold, subject to a lien of twice its value which may eventually be payable or not payable, as the accidental result of the sheriff’s <a id="p158" href="#p158" data-label="158" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*158</a>official duty may be well or ill performed; all competition is out of the question, and the estate falls into the hands of some one willing to gamble upon the result. We hold that a judicial sale will divest any lien which is susceptible of being reduced to certainty of amount, <em>at any </em>timé, by calculation. <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Rawle%20447" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Rawle 447">4 Rawle, 447</a> ; <a href="/rawle/2/0166-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="2 Rawle 166" data-case-ids="1820557" data-case-paths="/rawle/2/0166-01">2 Rawle, 166</a>.

It is better for the debtor to have the money retained, than to have his property sacrificed; better for the creditor to get his money at a remote period, than not get it at all. From every consideration, we think it is expedient that the principle should be settled, that the land should be sold divested of the lien.</p>

To this general principle there are many exceptions; and this, it strikes me, is one. The ■sheriff’s recognisance is taken by virtue of the act of the 13th of April, 1834; which provides, that every sheriff, before he shall be commissioned, or execute the duties of his office, shall enter into recognisance, and be bound in a bond with at least two sufficient sureties, in the sums and'manner therein mentioned. The act provides the form of the recognisance, and makes it a lien, as well on the land, as goods and chattels of the sheriff, and bail. It is taken for the use of the Several suitors and parties interested in the execution of writs, and for the well and faithful execution and performance of all and singular the trusts and duties of his office To <a id="p160" href="#p160" data-label="160" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*160</a>extend, therefore, the scope of the decisions referred to, so as to embrace the lien of a sheriff’s recognisance, will defeat or greatly impair the wise and salutary designs plainly indicated in <em>the </em>act, by converting real into personal security. It will, moreover, be extremely unjust to sureties whose property will be diverted from the payment of their own debts and locked up in court, where there has not, and perhaps never will be, any breach of the recognisance whatever ; or, in other words, it must remain to answer a contingency which may never happen. It is true, cases may occur where the lien of the recognisance may affect the price of the lands when sold at a judicial sale ; but this is a contingency which can occur but seldom, and, moreover, one to which the surety has voluntarily exposed himself; and his convenience and benefit must yield to the public good. It never entered into the contemplation of either the court or the legislature, that a lien expressly created for a great public object should be defeated or impaired by any judicial sale whatever.</p>
