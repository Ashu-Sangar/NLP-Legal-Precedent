The distribution in this case is. of personal estate. If the grandchildren have a right to anj part of the testator’s estate, it must be by repre- ’ sentation of their deceased father, and not share and share alike with <a id="p306" href="#p306" data-label="306" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*306</a>the immediate issue living. The testator’s personal estate is «to be equally divided among all the heirs.” Now who are the heirs intended here ? Grandchiidren, although their parents are dead, are not heirs. The books say the heir is the person next in the line of succession; and certainly grandchildren are not next in the line of succession, where the children are in full life. In Halloway <em>v. </em>Halloway, Lord Alvanley said, «heirs mean such persons as the law-points out to succeed to personal property. A bequest to the heirs of an individual, without addition or explanation, will belong to the next of kin.” 1 Rop. on Leg. 85, sec. 3, pi. 2; 18 Law Lib. 106 ; Ward on Leg. 106. In this case, by resorting to the statute of distribution for the persons, and to the will for the quantum, the estate would be taken from the heirs proper. The will, and the law arising on the terms used by the testator, designate the persons who are made the objects of his bounty. He cited, Loveday <em>v. </em>Hopkins, Ambler’s Reports, 272 ; 2 Dessassure’s Rep. 33, to show that the word «heirs” will be construed to mean children. The statute of distribution will never be resorted to, unless the terms of the bequest are so general as to occasion a virtual intestacy: and, therefore, where the bequest is to relations, or to kindred, the statute is resorted to; but where the bequest is to next of kin, it is confined to the nearest relations.</p>

The intention of testator must be taken from the will itself. <a href="/citations/?q=14%20Johns.%20Rep.%201" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="14 Johns. Rep. 1">14 Johns. Rep. 1</a>. The whole will must be taken together; every word must bear its legitimate part and signification. In the language of bis honour, the Chief Justice, in another case, « every thing must be sounded.” The words of the will in relation to the question now before the court, are, «my will is that the remaining part of my goods, stocks, chattels, merchandise and household furniture, shall be impartially appraised, and after such appraisement made, that the same shall be <em>equally divided </em>betw-een <em>all </em>the heirs.” The question is what proportion of the personal estate of the grandfather do his grandchildren take under that clause in the will ? Do they take <em>per capita </em>or <em>per stirpes </em>? The language of the will is, that his residuary personal estate shall be <em>equally </em>divided among <em>all </em>the heirs; now, we contend that if the grandchildren are heirs at all, they must come in each for a share <em>per capita. </em>The intention of the testator must govern the construction; and where he plainly and distinctly says that his estate is to be divided between <em>all his heirs equally, </em>we cannot make <a id="p307" href="#p307" data-label="307" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*307</a>any other construction of his intention without erasing from the will the significant and well understood adverb “ equally,” than this, that the grandchildren are to take each an equal portion with the children. « The heir is he upon whom the law casts the estate immediately on the death of the ancestor.” In England, where the law of primogeniture prevails, the eldest son is the heir; but in Pennsylvania, where the estate is cast upon all the children and grandchildren, they are all heirs. Under our intestate laws, grandchildren take by representation of their parent, and they take together the share of that parent, because the law directs that mode of distribution; but they take as heirs, for they can take in no other way. Being heirs, therefore, they are expressly within the donation, contained in the will of the testator, in the present case, and he having made no distinction in his bequest between his children and grandchildren, as to the <em>quantum </em>of each, but instead of that, having directed that the bequest should be divided <em>between all the heirs equally </em>; we say that the grandchildren take equally with the children, and that the bequest should be distributed to all the heirs, <em>per capita. </em>In support of this position, the following cases were cited: 1 Roper on Legacies, 126, 127, 128; <a href="/serg-rawl/8/0043-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="8 Serg. &amp; Rawle 43" data-case-ids="1809617" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/8/0043-01">8 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 43</a>; <a href="/serg-rawl/11/0103-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="11 Serg. &amp; Rawle 103" data-case-ids="1812764" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/11/0103-01">11 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 103</a>.</p>

By these expressions, he means, his own heirs, which can only be ascertained by resorting to the statute of distribution, as has often been done in analogous cases; and taking this to be the rule, it descends to the children and grandchildren, <em>per </em>stirpes, This show's the persons who are to take, and the same rule must be applied to the quantum of the estate. By all the heirs, the testator means his children and grandchildren, who, in his eye, and by intendment of law, constitute but one heir. And this rule not only produces equity, but receives confirmation from the preceding part of the will; for when the testator speaks of his children, he specifies them by name; but when he refers to his grandchildren, he speaks of them as a class. Thus, he bequeathes part of his estate to be divided equally between his daughter Peggy and his son Daniel’s children, <a id="p308" href="#p308" data-label="308" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*308</a>and John Black’s children, substituting his grandchildren as a branch, in the place of their respective parents.</p>
