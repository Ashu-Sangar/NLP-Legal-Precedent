The surely requires the obligee to “take another bond, or payment.” When the Supreme Court decided, that the notice should be distinct, they did not mean that it should be technical. Payment includes every thing that could possibly be required; the absolute cancellation of the suretiship by any means the obligee might think proper to pursue; so only that the surety who gave the notice should be released.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b264-5" data-blocks='[["BL_264.5",264,[317,1136,1177,335]]]'>2. The notice being a good one, it discharges Adam Ritscher; and so also it discharges Charles Greenawalt. A release to one obligee is a release to both, in equity as well as in law. Bown <em>v. </em>Swadlin, 1 Atk. 343; and also in 2 Pothier on Obligations, 59 &amp; 66, and in notes; where the same doctrine is decided.

If it be not a release to Charles Greenawalt for the whole amount of the claim, it at least discharges him from the one-half of it; and this upon the principle laid down in 1 Poth. 323, top page, that where a creditor renders himself incapable of ceding his right of action against a co-surety, he loses his claim against the other surety, for so much as the co-surety would have been bound to contribute. Now, if this notice be good, Ritscher is certainly discharged ; then what right of action can the plaintiff below cede to Greenawalt against Ritscher ? By his own act, he has released him from all liability. Can he then exercise the power which is conceded to him in ordinary cases, which is recognised in Gardiner <em>v. </em>Ferree, <a href="/citations/?q=15%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%2030" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="15 Serg. &amp; Rawle 30">15 Serg. &amp; Rawle 30</a>, of offering the surety the bond to sue in his name ?</p>

The defendant’s co-surety gave notice that he would no longer consider himself bound, and requested the creditor to take another bond or payment. What was the creditor to infer from that, beyond the obvious meaning of the words ? The request to take another bond is too plain to be mistaken for a request to sue; but the request to take payment, might perhaps be taken for a hint to push for the money. But, according to the plain rule laid down for all cases, a hint is not enough. It requires an explicit direction to sue, that there may be no misapprehension of the meaning. It is as easy to speak plainly as mysteriously ; and there wrnuld be no certainty in the rule if it left the courts to grope for the meaning of the surety among ambiguous words. Cases will arise which it would be difficult to determine; and we should in the end have no rule at all. Nor would the creditor know how to keep himself safe, unless he were to fly at the principal on the first intimation of the sureties’ impatience. Had his laches exonerated one of the sureties, in this instance it may well be that he could not have proceeded against the other; but it is very clear that both are bound.</p>
