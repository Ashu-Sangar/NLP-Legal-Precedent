      <em>“ </em>George Mitchell, the plaintiff, claims- title tp the land in dispute under Frederick Lazarus, to whom a warrant issued’ on the 26th of •November, 1793, and on which a survey was made on the 15th of-May, 1794, and returned to the. land-office,. 19th November, 1795. The death of Frederick Lazarus is proven, and his heirs by their-deed, dated the 2d of November, 1837, convey to George Mitchell, the plaintiff, by which, George Mitchell became the owner of • whatever title Frederick Lazarus or his heirs’-had to the lands, within the survey on that warrant. The defendant has shown that the tract surveyed on this warrant, in the name' of Frederick .Lazarus, was’ patented to John Frees, <em>on </em>the 1st of December, '1795. The patent recites a deed-poll from F. Lazarus to William Bratton; a deed from Bratton to John Frees, the patentee.- ’ This is all that is shown-by either party of the legal title, and the defendants do not-pretend to <a id="p45" href="#p45" data-label="45" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*45</a>show any title in them, derived from the patentee; and their evidence shows that they are holding adverse to the legal title granted by the Commonwealth, to either F. Lazarus or John Frees. The intermediate conveyances recited'in the patent, as conveying the title of .Lazarus to John Frees, are not shown. ‘ Had they been shown, the plaintiff, who, in ejectment, must recover on the strength of his own title, could not have recovered; for, in that case, the heirs of Frederick Lazarus would not have any estate or interest in the land to convey, and their deed to Mitchell would be no better to him than so much blank paper. But the bare recital of these conveyances in the patent are not, evidence of those conveyances against the warrantee, when the defendant does not show his possession under, but adverse to the title granted by the Commonwealth to Frees, the patentee. This patent then cannot prevail in this case, as it stands before us, against the title claimed by the plaintiff through the warrantee. The defendant alleges an improvement made by Robert--Elliott, previous to the location of the warrant, which included a part, and the part in. dispute of the Lazarus survey. You will observe from the evidence, that the house of Elliott is not on the Lazarus tract, but some considerable distance from it. The land, cleared about the house or cabin, called Elliott’s, does not extend to the Lazarus tract. A small field was also cleared up towards the mountain, not on the Lazarus tract; but a small field on the line of the Lazarus survey, some of the witnesses s.ay, was cleared over on to Lazarus’s. They do not say when it was cleared, or by whom.Montgomery says there was none cleared oyer; Andrew Bratton does not recollect to have seen any cleared ovér. That the Brat-tons-claimed land there, under the Elliott improvement, is not dis-put’ed. But did their claim under that improvement extend to the Lazarus survey. Under, the improvement they have not taken up; ' or, at least, not .shown us, that, they have taken up any land by warrant from the Commonwealth. Mr. Bratton speaks of vacant land there, but not sufficient to fill a warrant of four hundred acres. It is not shown' to us, when the vacant part was confined to the quantity now vacant by the location of their warrant' on the adjoining land, except the warrant of Frederick Lazarus. There may, for any thing that appears in evidence, have been at the time the Lazarus survey was located, more than four hundred acres vacant. That the adjoining surveys were made previous to Lazarus’s survey, so as to leave the quantity that could have -been taken up on the Elliott improvement, has not been shown. Then,if theother surveys now located —if there are any — were not located; until since Elliott made his im<a id="p46" href="#p46" data-label="46" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*46</a>provement, how is it to be known, without the settler designates his boundaries, in what direction from his house he is going to take up his three hundred acres on his improvement. Men, who go <em>to the </em>land-office, and take out their warrants for land in the neighbourhood, are not all bound to keep at such a distance from the improvement, so as that the improver can by his three hundred acres, in What direction he pleases from his improvement, include it. If the defendant had shown, that warrants and surveys encroached on his improvement, so as not to leave sufficient vacant land to fill up a warrant of the three hundred acres, or leaving that much for the Elliott improvement, without taking a part of what is surveyed on the Lazarus warrant, there would be some reason for the argument of the defendant’s counsel, that it all should be taken from Frederick Lazarus, or the land on which Frederick Lazarus is located.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b44-4" data-blocks='[["BL_44.4",44,[301,1110,1185,1057]]]'>“ The question for you, in the first place, under the evidence, is to say, whether Robert Elliott, or the Brattons, whose claim is the same, claimed by virtue of their improvement, any part, or the part of the Lazarus survey included in the lines run on the McDonald warrant, and have kept up their improvement without abandoning that claim. If they have, it will prevail against the title of the plaintiff, as further evidence to show that they claimed and are entitled, by their improvement, to the land in dispute. They show that the last person in possession of the Elliott house was sailor Billy Brat-ton, jun., who, about 1819 or 20, moved from the old building, to a new house put up within the lines run for McDonald on the Lazarus survey. The old improvement was not kept up after that. It appears that Billy Bratton went on to this land in the new house, claiming under the McDonald warrant. If the Brattons abandoned this old improvement, or, by it, did not include in their claim the part now in dispute, which is the part included within the lines run on the McDonald warrant, the plaintiff would be entitled to recover. If you find that they did not abandon their claim, and in their claim you are satisfied they included the part in dispute, the defendant would be entitled to a verdict. Should you find for the plaintiff, your verdict will be for the part only in the defendant’s possession, which is included in the lines of Lazarus’s survey.”</p>
