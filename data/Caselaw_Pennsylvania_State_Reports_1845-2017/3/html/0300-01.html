A suit was also brought by the said bank against Jacob Baab, as endorser and surety bn the said note, in Dauphin Common Pleas, No. 72, January Term, 1840j in which a judgment of $270 94 was rendered for the amount of the said note, on the 6th February, 1840, which was revived by <em>sci. fa. </em>No. 24, January Term, 1844. The real estate of Jacob Baab was sold by the sheriff of Dauphin county, in August, 1845 ; and the proceeds of the sale having been brought into court, a distribution of the same was confirmed by the court, 31st October, 1845, by which the debt, interest and costs of the said judgment of the Harrisburg Bank against Jacob Baab, amounting to $380 62, was ordered to be paid. The debt due to the Harrisburg Bank was therefore .paid out of the sale of Jacob Baab’s property, who was but a surety; and on the 6th day of December, 1845, the Harrisburg Bank assigned this judgment to Jacob Baab,'and on the same day Jacob Baab assigned his right to substitution and interest in the same judgment to Christian Hmhnlen, who therefore claims the whole judgment against Philip German, under this assignment. Dr. W. W. Rutherford obtained a judgment against Jacob Baab, on the 22d November, 1841, for $299 07, No. 145, August Term, 1841, on which a payment has been made, reducing the sum now due to $240; which sum would have been paid out of the proceeds of the sale of Jacob Baab’s property, if the said judgment of the Harrisburg Bank had not preceded it. C. Hmhnlen also recovered a judgment against Jacob Baab, 392, August Term, 1843, entered November 18, 1843, for $1800, on account of which the said assignment was made to him by said Jacob Baab.</p>

Baab was the surety, or endorser of German; and the only substitution which could be made in the case, was made. As soon as the Harrisburg Bank received the amount of its judgment against Baab, out of the sale of his property, it perfected his right to substitution against German the drawer, by an actual transfer to him of the judgment against German. The right of substitution being a personal right, could not be effected by the operation of the judgment of Rutherford; and Baab having become justly and equitably plaintiff against German, had a right to dispose of the judgment; and on the 6th of December, 1845, the same day on which he received the transfer, he assigned it to Hsehnlen, also one of his judgment creditors, who now stands plaintiff in the judgment. Subrogation is a principle of mere equity and benevolence, and will not be enforced at the expense of a legal right, <a href="/watts/8/0384-01" class="citation" data-index="7" data-cite="8 Watts 384" data-case-ids="1848375" data-case-paths="/watts/8/0384-01">8 Watts, 384</a>. Here is a legal right vested in Hsehnlen; and will equity, after it has been thus vested for a period of five months, interpose to take it from him, and give it to one not known to the record ? It might as well interpose in any other judgment in which Baab stands plaintiff within the jurisdiction of the court. A surety is not <em>ipso facto </em>substituted on payment of the debt of the principal. His remedy is for money paid and expended. <a href="/watts-serg/6/0190-01" class="citation" data-index="8" data-cite="6 Watts &amp; Serg. 190" data-case-ids="480284" data-case-paths="/watts-serg/6/0190-01">6 Watts &amp; Serg. 190</a>, 199. Suppose, therefore, that the Harrisburg Bank had not had judgment against German the drawer, and Baab, after paying the debt, had brought suit against German for so much money paid; would any court of equity for a moment entertain a motion to substitute a creditor of Baab, plaintiff in that action ? It would not, and therefore Rutherford’s application for substitution on this ground must also fail.</p>

Rutherford, who seeks to be admitted to Baab’s right of substitution, is merely his creditor, not the creditor of German, whose interest is subordinate only to that of Baab. But Baab’s right of substitution is a personal one, which he might waive; and what right has his creditor to insist that it shall be exercised not for his benefit, but against his will ? It is true that the lien of Rutherford’s judgment against Baab’s land, was excluded by the bank’s judgment; but that gave Rutherford no equity against German, whose interest was independent of him. Neither did it give him a right to the bank’s securities, with whom it stood in no privity; stil) <a id="p304" href="#p304" data-label="304" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*304</a>less did it give Mm a right against Baab’s assignee of the right to substitution, who, for any thing that appears, stands in equal, if not superior equity.
