The deed was not recorded until May, 1841. Shortly after the sale, J. entered under a parol agreement to purchase, made valuable improvements, demised the premises and received the rents, until April, 1841, when he re-sold to P. in payment of debts, by an agreement not recorded. P. subsequently received the rents. In 1843, the land was sold under a judgment against J., notice being given by P., that the land was his, and the title had always been in him. The jury having found the re-conveyance by J. to P. was a <em>bona, fide </em>sale; <em>held, </em>that the record of the sheriff’s deed, after the grantee therein had sold and re-purchased, was insufficient to affect a purchaser from his grantee by parol being in possession, <em>until notice </em>; that the mere receipt of rent by P. from tenants holding under leases from J., was also insufficient to affect him with notice of P.’s title ; that the notice at the sale was sufficient to charge the purchaser.

The agreement does not profess to reconvey the property to Philip; and the point was, that the parol sale to John, accompanied with payment of purchase money, and valuable improvements, had divested the title from Philip, and vested it in John Zieber; and thus making a re-conveyance necessary. Wiley <em>v. </em>Crist, <a href="/citations/?q=4%20Watts%20198" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="4 Watts 198">4 Watts, 198</a>; Burke <em>v. </em>Allen, <a href="/yeates/3/0350-01" class="citation" data-index="1" data-cite="3 Yeates 351" data-case-ids="6774103" data-case-paths="/yeates/3/0350-01">3 Yeates, 351</a>. The agreement of 4th May, 1841, is in operation as a grant, bargain, or sale. There being no words in it of grant, bargain or sale; it could not operate as a release, because <a id="p250" href="#p250" data-label="250" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*250</a>Philip had then no estate in the premises, and was out of possession; it was intended merely as a security for John’s indebtedness to Philip ; it was not even a conditional sale, but must have been intended as a mortgage, John having the right to redeem on payment of his indebtedness. If not so intended, why not execute deeds as usual ? And, moreover, it is an unrecorded mortgage, and as such will not prevail against creditors or purchaser at sheriff’s sale. Field <em>v. </em>Hamilton, <a href="/serg-rawl/17/0070-01" class="citation" data-index="2" data-cite="17 Serg. &amp; Rawle 70" data-case-ids="1818199" data-case-paths="/serg-rawl/17/0070-01">17 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 70</a>; Jacques <em>v. </em>Weeks, <a href="/watts/7/0261-01" class="citation" data-index="3" data-cite="7 Watts 261" data-case-ids="1846900" data-case-paths="/watts/7/0261-01">7 Watts, 261</a>. Notice at sheriff’s sale, therefore, was too late to affect plaintiff, who was a judgment creditor, and Edward D. Smith and others, judgment creditors, whose judgments were prior to notice. At page 270 of 7 Watts, Justice Sergeant says, “ and although the law, with regard to a purchaser or mortgagee with notice, is as I have stated; yet it seems to be different with regard to a judgment creditor, and the purchaser under an execution on such judgment. For it has been adjudicated by this court, that a judgment creditor taires a priority over an unrecorded mortgage. Semple <em>v. </em>Burd, <a href="/citations/?q=7%20Serg.%20%26%20Rawle%20290" class="citation" data-index="4" data-cite="7 Serg. &amp; Rawle 290">7 Serg. &amp; Rawle, 290</a>; and 17 Serg. &amp; Rawle, supra. If so, a purchaser at sheriff’s sale under such judgment cannot be affected by a notice of a mortgage, which notice is given subsequently to the judgment.” S. P.

As to whether the agreement amounted to a mortgage or conditional sale, Mr. Davis contended that the whole transaction from the beginning and throughout, including agreement, showed clearly that Philip held John’s property as security for John’s indebtedness ; and that no contrivance should avail to make that which at one time was but a security for money, become at another time an absolute conveyance of the estate ; and cited, as establishing this principle, 1 P.
