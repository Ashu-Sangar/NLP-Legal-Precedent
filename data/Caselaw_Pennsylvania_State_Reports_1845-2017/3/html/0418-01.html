      <em>July </em>29. This was an action in 1844, by a witness in a cause tried May Term, 1835, to recover his daily pay. To avoid the plea of the statute of limitations, plaintiff called a witness, who testified that at one time, (other evidence showed it to have been in 1839,) he saw the defendant offer plaintiff a bank note, and that defendant stated it was for witness fees; but witness did not know its amount, ■whether a five or ten dollar note. That plaintiff refused to accept it, saying, if defendant would give it all to him, he would take it.</p>

But if he offered to pay the amount of the note for what costs had been incurred, and the plaintiff refused it, because defendant would not pay the entire amount due, it -would not have the effect contended for. That the jury would decide whether it was an offer to pay on account, or in full satisfaction.</p>

That is not the case here. It is uncertain what amount the defendant offered, or whether he offered it as a compromise, or as a payment in part, or of the whole. Zimmerman is the only witness; and he says he saw the defendant offer a bank note to the plaintiff, but does not know how much, for costs as a witness in behalf of the defendant in a former suit. The plaintiff would not take the money, saying if the defendant would give it all to him he would take it. He cannot tell whether it was a five or ten dollar note, or either. On this evidence the court left it to the jury to determine whether it was an offer of part payment, or only an offer of the note for what costs he owed him, by way of compromise. But there is no evidence from which the jury could determine either of these alternatives ; they could at best but conjecture: whereas, to make it such an acknowledgment as amounts to a promise, it should be shown clearly by some evidence, that the offer was in payment of part of the debt. No testimony was given but that of Zimmerman, and his evidence leaves the matter uncertain and obscure.</p>
