The plaintiff proved his case, and there was no evidence of notice having been given him by the sheriff that there was a surplus. Lowrie, J., directed a verdict for plaintiff, reserving the question as to the effect of the plea; and subsequently gave judgment for defendant <em>non </em>obstante, &amp;c., for the following reasons:—</p>

    <p class="summary" id="b121-5" data-blocks='[["BL_121.5",121,[187,1103,1177,398]]]'>“The decision is entitled to respect for its antiquity, and for the learning of the judges who pronounced it; but we.are not estopped from inquiring how far it accords in principle with more modern rules. And we must deny its authority altogether, if we find it to be opposed to the ordinary principles of construction of the statute of limitations, and leave it to the usual fate of cases, founded, not upon principle or general rules, but upon some fanciful notions of <em>exceptional </em>justice.</p>
    <p class="summary" id="b121-6" data-blocks='[["BL_121.6",121,[189,1506,1175,597]]]'>“ The case of Cockram <em>v. </em>Welbye is so variously reported, that it is difficult to ascertain the form of action, or the ground of the decision. But certainly the principal ground of the decision is, that the claim, though not matter of record, is yet founded upon it, and has a strong relation to it; and this is, I think, a false foundation. Mr. Justice Scroggs, who differed from the rest of the court, thought that the receipt of the money raised a contract by implication in favour of the plaintiff, and that the action was properly founded upon this contract, and was of course barred. And upon this principle was decided, very shortly afterwards, the case of Oliver <em>v. </em>Thomas, 3 Lev. 367, for attorney’s fees, they not being matter of record as against his client.</p>

      <em>“ </em>It is not necessary to decide whether, in an action upon the bond or recognisance of the sheriff, this plaintiff could be admitted to come in and assign, as a breach, the non-payment of a debt barred by the statute; though I think he could not, or rather, if he should do so, the plaintiff might meet him by setting up the bar of the statute. If the plaintiff could recover in this way, I should hesitate before I would say that his claim is barred simply because he has adopted the remedy of <em>assumpsit.”</em>
