Dayton, the defendant, was a creditor of Fross, and purchased the land. An agreement was then made between Dayton and Fross, by which their accounts were settled, and a bond given by the latter to the former, in settlement, and also in consideration that Dayton would pay the bond of Fross, held by Hart &amp; French. Several years elapsed, and this bond was not paid, but suit was brought on it, and judgment recovered against Fross.</p>

It is totally unlike the casé of a surety, who, though bound to pay, cannot maintain an action against his -principal, until he has actually paid; for it is only then his principal is in default. But here, one for a valuable consideration received, undertook, absolutely, to pay a debt for which another is responsible. No time being expressly ascertained, within which the agreement is to be performed, the law allows to the promisor a reasonable time. But, regardless of his obligation, he permits nearly five years to roll round; at the end of which time the original debtor is sued, before he institutes an action upon the agreement of the defendant. For the breach of such an undertaking, the measure of damages is the amount the defendant undertook to answer, and to which the plaintiff remains subject. It is not necessary he should have paid; it is enough that he is compellable to pay. The undertaking of the promisor is violated by leaving him open to be called on; and the case affords no other standard than the whole sum for which he remains liable. The answer of the court to the fourth and fifth points was therefore correct.</p>
