Thomas died in <em>1844; </em>administration was granted in 1845, and the usual advertisements were made. The appellants’ claim was for rent that accrued in the lifetime of Thomas, under an agreement, “that Thomas may have the privilege of taking coal out of the P. mine, he paying to the respective owners thereof (of whom Thomas was one) their respective proportions of the sum of twenty-five cents per cubic yard of coal so taken out, as rent for the said privilege.” This was determinable on one month’s notice by either party, and “ the rent” was to be paid quarterly.</p>

The question then is, whether the appellants’ claim was a privileged one; and that depends on the nature of their contract with the decedent. It was the grant of a right to mine coal for so much the ton; and the <em>redditus </em>was consequently a certain rent for which a distress might have been made. In substance, it was as distinctly a lease as that in Offerman <em>v. </em>

But it is certain that one joint tenant or tenant in common may lease his part to his felloAy. The whole claim therefore ought to have been alloAyed.</p>
