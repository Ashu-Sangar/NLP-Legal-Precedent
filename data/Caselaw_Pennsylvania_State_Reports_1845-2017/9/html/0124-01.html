But we think that case establishes no such principle. There the sheriff had separate executions against each of the individual partners, but he had no joint execution against the partnership property. His sale, therefore, was of the separate interest of the several partners; and the court held that the separate creditors were entitled to the proceeds of the sale, to the exclusion of the joint creditors. In the case before us, if the doctrine contended for by the separate creditor, that the $2,224 must be considered as the proceeds of Griffiths’ interest, then what becomes of the return to Faber’s execution, where the sheriff also <a id="p127" href="#p127" data-label="127" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*127</a>reports a sale of the partnership property to the same amount. If the sale of Griffiths’ interest produced $2,224, and the sale of Griffiths &amp; Dixon’s interest produced the same sum, then it follows that but one-half the amount produced has been paid into court, But manifestly the sheriff sold, under all the writs, the entire partnership stock, at one operation, and has, by his returns, ascertained the proceeds of the partnership property; and we do not think that we are liberty to fix another amount.</p>

Is he bound to sell the equity of redemption on the <em>venditioni exponas </em>first, or may he sell the property out and out, upon the <em>levari facias, </em>and so that the proceeds may be distributed according to priority of lien?

This is precisely what has been done in this case; and we think the partnership creditors are entitled to the money, and as there is no surplus, the separate creditor can have nothing. The distribution of the auditors, in this particular, is therefore approved.”</p>
