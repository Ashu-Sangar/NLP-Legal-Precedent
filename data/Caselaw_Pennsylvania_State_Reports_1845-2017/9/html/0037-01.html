The defence taken was an outstanding title in one Lewis; but it appeared that when Bradford was about purchasing, he was informed by Lewis that he had a claim to the land. It also appeared that the agent of Potts had said to Bradford that he supposed this to refer to a claim of title in one Wilson, and that he did not think it amounted to anything. The court (Conyngham, P. J.) instructed the jury this was immaterial, since Lewis had not restricted or specified the nature of his claim, and that the purchaser must look to his covenant, should he be ejected under Lewis’s title.</p>

On a contract executed, even to show the title doubtful, would not avail the defendant: W. 57. Here there was no covenant broken.
