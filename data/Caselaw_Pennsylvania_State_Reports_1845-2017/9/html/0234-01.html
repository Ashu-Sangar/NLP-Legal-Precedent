It was held, in Allen <em>v. </em>Dundas, 3 T. Rep. 125, that the probate unrepealed is conclusive evidence of a will of personalty, and therefore payment of money to an executor who has obtained probate of a forged will, is a discharge to the debtor of'the intestate, though the probate be afterwards declared null and void: and in Coe <em>v. </em>Westernham, 2 Selw. N. P. 12, it was resolved, that the probate is the only legitimate evidence of personal property being vested in the executor, or of the executor’s appointment.</p>

The probate of a will is a judicial act; and, as such, the probate by the register cannot be declared void in a collateral proceeding. Although the will may be controverted in an action of ejectment, in which the realty is implicated, yet the probate by the register is <em>primd facie </em>evidence: 6 S. &amp; R. 223, <a href="/binn/3/0498-01" class="citation" data-index="0" data-cite="3 Binn. 498" data-case-ids="1791076" data-case-paths="/binn/3/0498-01">3 Binn, 498</a>; and in Logan <em>v. </em>Watt, 5 S. &amp; R. 212, it was held that the <a id="p235" href="#p235" data-label="235" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*235</a>certificate of the register of wills, that a will of lands had been duly proved before him, and a copy thereof is annexed, is <em>primd facie </em>evidence of such will, though a copy of such probate is not set out. The same point was ruled in 10 S. &amp; R. 84.</p>
    <p id="b235-4" data-blocks='[["BL_235.4",235,[202,603,1176,546]]]'>In the present case, the register makes what is substantially a decree that the codicil was duly proved before him on the 30th December, 1815, by the subscribing witness. He does not say that no other person was examined; and the presumption is at least in equilibrium between another person being sworn and no other person making probate. Every fair intendment ought to be made in favour of the correctness of the proceeding, after this lapse of time. The will and the codicil have been acted upon for more than thirty years by the devisees; and as the codicil, operates on the personal estate, which alone is in contest in this suit, the probate must be considered not <em>onlj primd facie, </em>but conclusive.</p>
