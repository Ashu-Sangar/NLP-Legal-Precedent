This was sent back, and pending the second reference, a claim was made on a judgment and mortgage against Ross, which had not been presented to the auditor, and were entered in Luzerne. The auditor rejected them, but the court admitted the claim — this was the error assigned.</p>

It is never too late, however, to do justice by correcting a defect before final judgment and decree; and even afterwards, the proceeding may be unravelled at the discretion of the court.
