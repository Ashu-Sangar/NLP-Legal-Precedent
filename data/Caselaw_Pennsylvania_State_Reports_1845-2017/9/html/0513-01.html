Under the former constitution, the office now in question was held at the pleasure of the governor, and by his appointment. The constitution of 1838 changed the mode of <a id="p514" href="#p514" data-label="514" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*514</a>selection, in two particulars: 1. In directing a popular election. 2. <em>In limiting the term to three years. </em>This is clearly defined, and was the object of the act of 2d July, 1889. This appears from § 3, which provides that the delay incident to a contested election shall be computed in the term of three years. This is reiterated in § 4. But for the convenience of the public, and to prevent a failure in the office, he is to hold “until his successor is qualified.” The spirit of the constitution is violated by allowing him to hold for a longer period, and the qualification of this rule is to be strictly construed. The true construction is to confine it to the contingency of the person elected neglecting or becoming incapable of being qualified. But a vacancy proper is to be filled in the mode pointed out. No commission is to issue until-the 1st of December following the election, and if, in that period, the person elected will not qualify, or cannot, then the incumbent holds over. And this emergency alone is thus provided for, as is apparent from the whole tenor of the instrument. For if there is no vacancy, and no appointment by the governor, there can be no election of a successor at the next general election, for that is allowed only in such cases. But a vacancy by death is one of the very instances spe-cified in the 4th section, for the appointment by the governor, until the people at the earliest opportunity may fill the office. It is true a commission cannot issue until December 1st, but before that time the person is “ elected to fill the office,” and does fill it, so as to cause a vacancy within the intent of the law.</p>

This, it is submitted, is the great object of the new constitution. Why should the office be filled by the governor when there is an incumbent chosen by the people, under the constitution ? But clearly the governor’s right is limited to the case of a vacancy. Was there then a vacancy when he appointed? This is the only question; and the answer is found in the commission, which, according to the constitution and law, authorizes the respondent to hold until his successor is duly qualified. His successor must have been elected under the constitution, and qualified, i. e. capable of entering on the duties of the office. Here Brooks was not qualified; hence there was no successor, and his death did not leave the office vacant, because the respondent was then law<a id="p515" href="#p515" data-label="515" data-citation-index="1" class="page-label">*515</a>fully filling it.

Being duly qualified in the constitutional sense, and in the ordinary acceptation of the words, unquestionably means that he, the successor, shall possess every qualification; that he shall, in all respects, comply with every requisite before entering on the duties of the office; that, in addition to being elected by the qualified electors, he shall be commissioned by the governor, give bond as required by law, and that he shall be bound by oath or affirmation (vide 8th article of constitution) to support the constitution of the commonwealth, and to perform the duties of the office with fidelity.' Until <em>all </em>these pre-requisites are complied with by his successor (for if you can dispense with one, you can dispense with all), the respondent is <em>de jure, </em>as well as <em>de </em>facto, the clerk of the Orphans’ Court.</p>

    <p id="b518-4" data-blocks='[["BL_518.5",518,[349,802,1174,1183]]]'>The constitution provides not only that the officer shall be elected, but that he shall be commissioned by the governor. This is conclusive proof that the election alone does not constitute him an officer in a constitutional sense. Eor there may be cases where the governor would be bound by an imperious sense of duty to withhold the commission from a person duly elected by the qualified electors; as, for example, in cases of insanity developed since the election, or the conviction of some high crime or misdemeanour. Where this occurs, and it is possible, although not probable, no person will venture to contend that the office is filled by election, as the relator contends, so as to create a vacancy by death. It is said, and this is the strength of the relator’s case, that the holding over of the incumbent is confined to the single instance of failure to qualify, a failure resulting from the act or omission of the successor. But for this distinction, we see no warrant in the constitution, or in the reason of the thing; for of what consequence is it in principle, whether the officer elect is prevented from qualifying himself by an inability or unwillingness to give the necessary security, by neglect or refusal to take the required oath or affirmation, by insanity or crime, or by the contingency of death ? It is enough for the incumbent who holds the office by a constitutional tenure, that for some cause, with which he has nothing to do, the requirements of the constitution and laws have not been complied with.</p>
    <p id="b518-5" data-blocks='[["BL_518.6",518,[346,2001,1170,432]]]'>The only inquiry is, has a successor been duly qualified ? if he has not, we are not at liberty to inquire whether it has arisen from his own act or omission, or has been caused by death, or by other causes over which the successor may have had no control. The 10th October, 1848, Brooks was elected to be the respondent’s successor, but he never was qualified, and never could be qualified, for he died the 7th of November 1848, within thirty days from the day of his election, and before his commission could be legally issued.</p>

Yacancies of the offices enumerated in the preceding part of this section, so reads the constitution, shall be filled by appointments to be made by the governor, to continue until the next general election, and until successors shall be elected and qualified as aforesaid. To maintain this proposition, that in this case the governor has the right of appointment, as a case of vacancy, it is necessary for the commonwealth to establish that the office, so far as to create a vacancy by death, is filled by election.</p>

It is an abuse of terms to say that at the time the governor issued his commission to the relator the office was vacant, for no person can plausibly deny that the respondent was the rightful possessor of the office, at that time.</p>

In this case we have to choose between the elect of the people and the appointee of the governor, and we think we cannot assail the intention of the constitution by inclining to the former rather than the latter*.
