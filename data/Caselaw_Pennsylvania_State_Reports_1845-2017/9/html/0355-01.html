But it also appeared, from the record, that these assignments were not signed by the assignors, nor were the names of the trustees inserted until September, 1838, when they were perfected in these particulars, under an order of the court. The plaintiff also showed that ineffectual attempts had been made by certain creditors from 1838 to 1842, to procure the removal of the insolvent trustees, on account of their alleged interest to sustain the prior voluntary assignments.</p>
