If the obligor was ready with the money when called for, it was all they could ask. The purchase-money was not invested for accumulation, and they knew it. The security was taken as an equivalent for the thing secured; and having the benefit of it, they cannot complain that the shadow is not greater than the substance. But they had a right to have the bond entered up; and whether it was at the suit of the proper plaintiff, cannot be told, as the bond is not part of the record. A transfer to a legal assignee could be pleaded as a defence on the merits, which could be attained only by opening the judgment.- But the execution for interest is erroneous.\nExecution set aside.",

By consent of creditors, the sheriff deposited the bond in court, arid Frost assigned it to the prothonotary. .On the application 'of the creditors, the court ordered judgment to be entered and execution to issue for the debt secured thereby, with interest from its date.
