It is never too late, however, to do justice by correcting a defect before final judgment and decree; and even afterwards, the proceeding may be unravelled at the discretion of the court. A mere slip, which may be retrieved, must not be allowed to work a forfeiture of right.\nDecree affirmed.",

This was sent back, and pending the second reference, a claim was made on a judgment and mortgage against Ross, which had not been presented to the auditor, and were entered in Luzerne. The auditor rejected them, but the court admitted the claim \u2014 this was the error assigned.\nWright, for appellant.\nFuller, contrd."
